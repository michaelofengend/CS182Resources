told people to fill out the survey and
 

15
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,469
told people to fill out the survey and
we said that we'll give extra credit if

16
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
we said that we'll give extra credit if
 

17
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,070
we said that we'll give extra credit if
for everybody in the class, 3% uh if 75%

18
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
for everybody in the class, 3% uh if 75%
 

19
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,990
for everybody in the class, 3% uh if 75%
of the class does the survey. I forgot

20
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
of the class does the survey. I forgot
 

21
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,870
of the class does the survey. I forgot
to give a deadline. I put it on online.

22
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
to give a deadline. I put it on online.
 

23
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,189
to give a deadline. I put it on online.
So this is

will quickly turn around and assign you
 

37
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,590
will quickly turn around and assign you
a report to review uh using the

38
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
a report to review uh using the
 

39
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,029
a report to review uh using the
conference management system. So you

40
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
conference management system. So you
 

41
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,350

goes off Thanksgiving break submit read
 

47
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,070
goes off Thanksgiving break submit read
the report of that you're assigned and

48
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
the report of that you're assigned and
 

49
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,469
the report of that you're assigned and
write a review. This is important to

50
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
write a review. This is important to
 

51
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,830
write a review. This is important to
give everyone feedback so that they can

52
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
give everyone feedback so that they can
 

53
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,309
give everyone feedback so that they can
make their projects better. Uh there

54
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
make their projects better. Uh there
 

55
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,390
make their projects better. Uh there
were some questions about when this uh

56
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
were some questions about when this uh
 

57
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,870
were some questions about when this uh
report is due. So it's uh due uh tonight

58
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
report is due. So it's uh due uh tonight
 

59
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,230
report is due. So it's uh due uh tonight
at the midnight. I think we will maybe

60
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
at the midnight. I think we will maybe
 

61
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,990
at the midnight. I think we will maybe
accept some submissions if they come in

62
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
accept some submissions if they come in
 

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,189
accept some submissions if they come in
late, but tomorrow morning we're going

64
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
late, but tomorrow morning we're going
 

65
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,830
late, but tomorrow morning we're going
to be assigning people to a review so

66
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
to be assigning people to a review so
 

67
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,189
to be assigning people to a review so
that we have to have it by then.

68
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
that we have to have it by then.
 

69
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,230
that we have to have it by then.
Um, okay. So, that's the the expectation

70
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
Um, okay. So, that's the the expectation
 

71
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,749
Um, okay. So, that's the the expectation
we have for everyone is that you've

72
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
we have for everyone is that you've
 

73
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,270
we have for everyone is that you've
worked very hard. You're working on your

74
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
worked very hard. You're working on your
 

75
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,309
worked very hard. You're working on your
reports and you are finding that there's

76
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
reports and you are finding that there's
 

77
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,150
reports and you are finding that there's
a lot more you want to do than you have

78
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
a lot more you want to do than you have
 

79
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,110
a lot more you want to do than you have
already done and that is to be expected.

80
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
already done and that is to be expected.
 

81
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,710
already done and that is to be expected.
But you have to write up what you've

82
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
But you have to write up what you've
 

83
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,830
But you have to write up what you've
done and what you're planning to do more

84
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
done and what you're planning to do more
 

85
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,270
done and what you're planning to do more
based on what you've seen so that

86
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
based on what you've seen so that
 

87
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,189
based on what you've seen so that
someone can give you feedback usefully.

88
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
someone can give you feedback usefully.
 

89
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,150
someone can give you feedback usefully.
Yeah. Question.

90
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
Yeah. Question.
 

91
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,670
Yeah. Question.
>> Approximately what percentage of the

92
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
>> Approximately what percentage of the
 

93
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,670
>> Approximately what percentage of the
class?

94
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
class?
 

95
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,670
class?
>> Um right now the percentage is uh sub

96
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
>> Um right now the percentage is uh sub
 

97
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,710
>> Um right now the percentage is uh sub
20%.

98
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720

 

99
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,950

>> Barely maybe 20. Okay. So you have to

100
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
>> Barely maybe 20. Okay. So you have to
 

101
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,110
>> Barely maybe 20. Okay. So you have to
tell your peers and your everyone in

102
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
tell your peers and your everyone in
 

103
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,430
tell your peers and your everyone in
your project group, hey you better uh be

104
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
your project group, hey you better uh be
 

105
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,670
your project group, hey you better uh be
doing this. Uh it's actually it's not I

106
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
doing this. Uh it's actually it's not I
 

107
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,350
doing this. Uh it's actually it's not I
look I went and I looked at the grades

108
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
look I went and I looked at the grades
 

109
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,909
look I went and I looked at the grades
last semester and 3% actually would have

110
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:15,919
last semester and 3% actually would have
 

111
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,830
last semester and 3% actually would have
moved quite a few people across grade

112
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
moved quite a few people across grade
 

113
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,309
moved quite a few people across grade
boundaries. So um it actually will

114
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
boundaries. So um it actually will
 

115
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,550
boundaries. So um it actually will
matter.

116
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
matter.
 

117
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,309
matter.
Okay.

118
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
Okay.
 

119
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,230
Okay.
So now I want to uh continue where we

120
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
So now I want to uh continue where we
 

121
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,990
So now I want to uh continue where we
left off. I kind of raised at the end on

122
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
left off. I kind of raised at the end on
 

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,150
left off. I kind of raised at the end on
the generative stuff. So I will slow

124
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
the generative stuff. So I will slow
 

125
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,430
the generative stuff. So I will slow
down and talk about that a little bit

126
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
down and talk about that a little bit
 

127
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,950
down and talk about that a little bit
more. Um we're going to do this uh

128
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
more. Um we're going to do this uh
 

129
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,950
more. Um we're going to do this uh
switch up of the order of material a

130
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
switch up of the order of material a
 

131
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,070
switch up of the order of material a
little bit in that we're going to

132
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
little bit in that we're going to
 

133
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,749
little bit in that we're going to
introduce VAES because they're useful

134
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
introduce VAES because they're useful
 

135
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,230
introduce VAES because they're useful
and important to introduce key ideas but

136
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
and important to introduce key ideas but
 

137
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,510
and important to introduce key ideas but
then we're going to switch for a little

138
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
then we're going to switch for a little
 

139
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,350
then we're going to switch for a little
bit to an interlude to talking about

140
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
bit to an interlude to talking about
 

141
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,510
bit to an interlude to talking about
post-training of models because then

142
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
post-training of models because then
 

143
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,270
post-training of models because then
we'll have the ingredients we need to

144
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
we'll have the ingredients we need to
 

145
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,950
we'll have the ingredients we need to
talk about that and then we'll switch

146
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
talk about that and then we'll switch
 

147
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,510
talk about that and then we'll switch
back uh to talking about generative

148
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
back uh to talking about generative
 

149
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,790
back uh to talking about generative
models and diffusion models in

150
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
models and diffusion models in
 

151
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,309
models and diffusion models in
particular. That's kind of the order in

152
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
particular. That's kind of the order in
 

153
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,070
particular. That's kind of the order in
which we're going to be going uh through

154
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
which we're going to be going uh through
 

155
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,029
which we're going to be going uh through
the class.

156
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
the class.
 

157
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,629
the class.
Okay, so

158
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
Okay, so
 

159
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,150
Okay, so
we talked about the idea of generative

160
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
we talked about the idea of generative
 

161
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,710
we talked about the idea of generative
models and it's important to remember

162
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
models and it's important to remember
 

163
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,909
models and it's important to remember
that when we talk about generative

164
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
that when we talk about generative
 

165
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,589
that when we talk about generative
models, we're talking about models in

166
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
models, we're talking about models in
 

167
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,869
models, we're talking about models in
which the goal is not like

168
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
which the goal is not like
 

169
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,430
which the goal is not like
classification or regression where you

170
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
classification or regression where you
 

171
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,990
classification or regression where you
want to assign a label to something.

172
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
want to assign a label to something.
 

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,710
want to assign a label to something.
It's instead to generate something new.

174
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
It's instead to generate something new.
 

175
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,189
It's instead to generate something new.
And we conceptualize this as sampling

176
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
And we conceptualize this as sampling
 

177
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,270
And we conceptualize this as sampling
from an unknown distribution. And the

178
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
from an unknown distribution. And the
 

179
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,270
from an unknown distribution. And the
problem of training a generative model

180
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
problem of training a generative model
 

181
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,709
problem of training a generative model
is to both both have an approach that

182
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
is to both both have an approach that
 

183
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,709
is to both both have an approach that
will let you sample from a distribution

184
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
will let you sample from a distribution
 

185
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,630
will let you sample from a distribution
as well as figuring out how you can

186
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
as well as figuring out how you can
 

187
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,550
as well as figuring out how you can
learn uh essentially a parameterized

188
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
learn uh essentially a parameterized
 

189
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,190
learn uh essentially a parameterized
form of the distribution from data.

190
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
form of the distribution from data.
 

191
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,630
form of the distribution from data.
Okay, that's the problem of general

192
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
Okay, that's the problem of general
 

193
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,670
Okay, that's the problem of general
models. And there's two categories of

194
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
models. And there's two categories of
 

195
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,710
models. And there's two categories of
this that we can think about um kind of

196
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
this that we can think about um kind of
 

197
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,470
this that we can think about um kind of
coming from probability. There's

198
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:50,480
coming from probability. There's
 

199
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,389
coming from probability. There's
sampling from an unconditional

200
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
sampling from an unconditional
 

201
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,710
sampling from an unconditional
distribution which is just that we have

202
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
distribution which is just that we have
 

203
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,310
distribution which is just that we have
a generative model. We've learned we

204
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
a generative model. We've learned we
 

205
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,230
a generative model. We've learned we
have we feed randomness into it and we

206
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
have we feed randomness into it and we
 

207
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,110
have we feed randomness into it and we
get a new example and that's it. And for

208
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
get a new example and that's it. And for
 

209
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,949
get a new example and that's it. And for
a lot of the teaching of the ideas we're

210
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
a lot of the teaching of the ideas we're
 

211
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,470
a lot of the teaching of the ideas we're
going to focus on this case but

212
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
going to focus on this case but
 

213
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,230
going to focus on this case but
practically the important case is

214
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
practically the important case is
 

215
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,550
practically the important case is
conditional generation where you're

216
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
conditional generation where you're
 

217
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,590
conditional generation where you're
sampling from a conditional

218
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
sampling from a conditional
 

219
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,829
sampling from a conditional
distribution. So you have some

220
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
distribution. So you have some
 

221
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,710
distribution. So you have some
conditioning and some randomness and out

222
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
conditioning and some randomness and out
 

223
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,470
conditioning and some randomness and out
pops a new example that is appropriately

224
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
pops a new example that is appropriately
 

225
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,150
pops a new example that is appropriately
drawn from the conditional distribution

226
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
drawn from the conditional distribution
 

227
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,430
drawn from the conditional distribution
conditioned on the conditioning that

228
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
conditioned on the conditioning that
 

229
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,550
conditioned on the conditioning that
you've given it. So you already know

230
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
you've given it. So you already know
 

231
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,710
you've given it. So you already know
examples of this uh which is the

232
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
examples of this uh which is the
 

233
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,670
examples of this uh which is the
conditioning can be like the prompt

234
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
conditioning can be like the prompt
 

235
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,829
conditioning can be like the prompt
in LMS and if you've ever used an image

236
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
in LMS and if you've ever used an image
 

237
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,750
in LMS and if you've ever used an image
generation model you can think about the

238
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
generation model you can think about the
 

239
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,110
generation model you can think about the
prompt you use to prompt an image

240
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
prompt you use to prompt an image
 

241
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,389
prompt you use to prompt an image
generation model is also a kind of

242
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
generation model is also a kind of
 

243
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,430
generation model is also a kind of
conditioning. So okay hopefully this is

244
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
conditioning. So okay hopefully this is
 

245
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,590
conditioning. So okay hopefully this is
clear in terms of what uh what the goal

246
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
clear in terms of what uh what the goal
 

247
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,750
clear in terms of what uh what the goal
of understanding generative modeling is.

248
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
of understanding generative modeling is.
 

249
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,269
of understanding generative modeling is.
And last time we talked about this uh a

250
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
And last time we talked about this uh a
 

251
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,790
And last time we talked about this uh a
couple of ideas that didn't work which

252
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
couple of ideas that didn't work which
 

253
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,269
couple of ideas that didn't work which
is important to understand and one was

254
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
is important to understand and one was
 

255
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,949
is important to understand and one was
this idea of using a classifier. And so

256
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
this idea of using a classifier. And so
 

257
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,430
this idea of using a classifier. And so
the idea was why why would you use a

258
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
the idea was why why would you use a
 

259
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,269
the idea was why why would you use a
classifier? This is the deep learning

260
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
classifier? This is the deep learning
 

261
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,949
classifier? This is the deep learning
philosophy of what do I know how to do?

262
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
philosophy of what do I know how to do?
 

263
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,389
philosophy of what do I know how to do?
I know how to train a classifier. So if

264
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
I know how to train a classifier. So if
 

265
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,990
I know how to train a classifier. So if
I have labeled images, I can train a

266
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
I have labeled images, I can train a
 

267
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,910
I have labeled images, I can train a
classifier. And now you can think about

268
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
classifier. And now you can think about
 

269
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,670
classifier. And now you can think about
doing conditional generation by saying

270
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
doing conditional generation by saying
 

271
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,110
doing conditional generation by saying
that an image of a cat I can think of as

272
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
that an image of a cat I can think of as
 

273
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,230
that an image of a cat I can think of as
being an image that the cat classifier

274
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
being an image that the cat classifier
 

275
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,310
being an image that the cat classifier
says is a cat

276
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
says is a cat
 

277
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,550
says is a cat
and then I have a natural strategy which

278
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
and then I have a natural strategy which
 

279
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,630
and then I have a natural strategy which
is I can sample a random image using

280
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
is I can sample a random image using
 

281
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,110
is I can sample a random image using
whatever distribution I want and then

282
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
whatever distribution I want and then
 

283
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,790
whatever distribution I want and then
ask whether it's a cat or not. That

284
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
ask whether it's a cat or not. That
 

285
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,590
ask whether it's a cat or not. That
doesn't work too many images. Next thing

286
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
doesn't work too many images. Next thing
 

287
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,590
doesn't work too many images. Next thing
you can do is say well I can sample a

288
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
you can do is say well I can sample a
 

289
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,110
you can do is say well I can sample a
random image. So in this picture that I

290
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
random image. So in this picture that I
 

291
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,550
random image. So in this picture that I
drew last time, you have all possible

292
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
drew last time, you have all possible
 

293
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,389
drew last time, you have all possible
images. The problem is the manifold of

294
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
images. The problem is the manifold of
 

295
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,550
images. The problem is the manifold of
natural images is very very thin. So

296
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
natural images is very very thin. So
 

297
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,230
natural images is very very thin. So
most images are not natural images. They

298
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
most images are not natural images. They
 

299
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,150
most images are not natural images. They
just look like random noise. So you

300
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
just look like random noise. So you
 

301
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,389
just look like random noise. So you
sample some image here and you're like,

302
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
sample some image here and you're like,
 

303
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,110
sample some image here and you're like,
I would like to make you cat-like. And I

304
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
I would like to make you cat-like. And I
 

305
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,710
I would like to make you cat-like. And I
can try to make you cat-like by doing

306
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
can try to make you cat-like by doing
 

307
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,190
can try to make you cat-like by doing
gradient ascent on the cat classifier

308
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
gradient ascent on the cat classifier
 

309
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,670
gradient ascent on the cat classifier
that I learned. That'll move me. And

310
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
that I learned. That'll move me. And
 

311
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,750
that I learned. That'll move me. And
what I want is for it to move me from

312
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
what I want is for it to move me from
 

313
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,030
what I want is for it to move me from
here onto the manifold of natural images

314
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
here onto the manifold of natural images
 

315
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,710
here onto the manifold of natural images
in particular that subset of the

316
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
in particular that subset of the
 

317
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,310
in particular that subset of the
manifold of natural images which

318
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
manifold of natural images which
 

319
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,389
manifold of natural images which
consists of cats.

320
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
consists of cats.
 

321
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,470
consists of cats.
But what actually happens is it just

322
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
But what actually happens is it just
 

323
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,910
But what actually happens is it just
moves from here somewhere here and says

324
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
moves from here somewhere here and says
 

325
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,949
moves from here somewhere here and says
this is very confidently a cat and it's

326
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
this is very confidently a cat and it's
 

327
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,870
this is very confidently a cat and it's
just random noise. So this doesn't work.

328
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
just random noise. So this doesn't work.
 

329
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,110
just random noise. So this doesn't work.
I mentioned last time that we can think

330
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
I mentioned last time that we can think
 

331
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,670
I mentioned last time that we can think
about uh when we talk about diffusion

332
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
about uh when we talk about diffusion
 

333
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,190
about uh when we talk about diffusion
models, we can think about diffusion

334
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
models, we can think about diffusion
 

335
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,829
models, we can think about diffusion
models as our attempt to make something

336
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
models as our attempt to make something
 

337
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,990
models as our attempt to make something
like this work.

338
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
like this work.
 

339
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,750
like this work.
Okay, to make it so that we can take

340
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
Okay, to make it so that we can take
 

341
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,630
Okay, to make it so that we can take
small steps and move towards the

342
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
small steps and move towards the
 

343
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,350
small steps and move towards the
manifold of natural images successfully

344
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
manifold of natural images successfully
 

345
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,310
manifold of natural images successfully
and to train something to do that. Okay,

346
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
and to train something to do that. Okay,
 

347
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,310
and to train something to do that. Okay,
but this idea very natural people tried

348
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
but this idea very natural people tried
 

349
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,350
but this idea very natural people tried
it at the beginning it uh did not work.

350
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
it at the beginning it uh did not work.
 

351
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,630
it at the beginning it uh did not work.
Okay, so the other idea we talked about

352
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:50,640
Okay, so the other idea we talked about
 

353
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,470
Okay, so the other idea we talked about
last time was the idea of using an

354
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
last time was the idea of using an
 

355
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,150
last time was the idea of using an
autoenccoder.

356
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
autoenccoder.
 

357
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,990
autoenccoder.
Okay, so the idea of using an

358
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay, so the idea of using an
 

359
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,069
Okay, so the idea of using an
autoenccoder said that well I have I I

360
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
autoenccoder said that well I have I I
 

361
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,750
autoenccoder said that well I have I I
recognized before that when I have a

362
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
recognized before that when I have a
 

363
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,630
recognized before that when I have a
lowdimensional structure I can learn an

364
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:04,640
lowdimensional structure I can learn an
 

365
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,470
lowdimensional structure I can learn an
autoenccoder that tries to exploit that

366
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
autoenccoder that tries to exploit that
 

367
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,910
autoenccoder that tries to exploit that
lowdimensional structure to do

368
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
lowdimensional structure to do
 

369
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,069
lowdimensional structure to do
dimensionality reduction.

370
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
dimensionality reduction.
 

371
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,030
dimensionality reduction.
And by doing that I feed in examples

372
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
And by doing that I feed in examples
 

373
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,870
And by doing that I feed in examples
from my distribution into my encoder. I

374
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
from my distribution into my encoder. I
 

375
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,230
from my distribution into my encoder. I
get a latent Z and then I run it through

376
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
get a latent Z and then I run it through
 

377
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,550
get a latent Z and then I run it through
a decoder and I get an X hat and then I

378
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
a decoder and I get an X hat and then I
 

379
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,710
a decoder and I get an X hat and then I
try to minimize the loss between X and

380
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
try to minimize the loss between X and
 

381
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,310
try to minimize the loss between X and
Xhat.

382
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
Xhat.
 

383
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,269
Xhat.
And the idea is by doing this I distill

384
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
And the idea is by doing this I distill
 

385
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,910
And the idea is by doing this I distill
out from X from the point of view how we

386
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
out from X from the point of view how we
 

387
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,670
out from X from the point of view how we
use it traditionally. The decoder is

388
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
use it traditionally. The decoder is
 

389
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,509
use it traditionally. The decoder is
just scaffolding. I use the the encoder

390
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
just scaffolding. I use the the encoder
 

391
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,590
just scaffolding. I use the the encoder
distills out what's important about the

392
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
distills out what's important about the
 

393
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,150
distills out what's important about the
image and what's important is what lets

394
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
image and what's important is what lets
 

395
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,470
image and what's important is what lets
you reconstruct it

396
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
you reconstruct it
 

397
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,870
you reconstruct it
and puts that into Z. And so one

398
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
and puts that into Z. And so one
 

399
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,470
and puts that into Z. And so one
perspective is to say well well the

400
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
perspective is to say well well the
 

401
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,790
perspective is to say well well the
decoder's job was do the opposite. It

402
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
decoder's job was do the opposite. It
 

403
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,629
decoder's job was do the opposite. It
was to take something that expressed the

404
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
was to take something that expressed the
 

405
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,629
was to take something that expressed the
important information and to actually

406
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
important information and to actually
 

407
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,750
important information and to actually
generate an image. Okay. And so the

408
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
generate an image. Okay. And so the
 

409
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,990
generate an image. Okay. And so the
natural idea is try using the uh

410
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
natural idea is try using the uh
 

411
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,870
natural idea is try using the uh
the decoder to generate samples. So

412
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
the decoder to generate samples. So
 

413
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,750
the decoder to generate samples. So
again to make it explicit I don't have a

414
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
again to make it explicit I don't have a
 

415
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,710
again to make it explicit I don't have a
Z. So what I do is I draw Z from a

416
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
Z. So what I do is I draw Z from a
 

417
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,670
Z. So what I do is I draw Z from a
random distribution and I say I run it

418
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
random distribution and I say I run it
 

419
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,350
random distribution and I say I run it
through the decoder and I see what I

420
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
through the decoder and I see what I
 

421
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,949
through the decoder and I see what I
get. So I train an autoenccoder for cats

422
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
get. So I train an autoenccoder for cats
 

423
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,590
get. So I train an autoenccoder for cats
and um it I try a validation for

424
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
and um it I try a validation for
 

425
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,030
and um it I try a validation for
example. I take a held out cat image. I

426
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
example. I take a held out cat image. I
 

427
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,430
example. I take a held out cat image. I
run it through the autoenccoder uh for

428
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
run it through the autoenccoder uh for
 

429
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,670
run it through the autoenccoder uh for
cats and out comes a reconstruction that

430
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
cats and out comes a reconstruction that
 

431
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,910
cats and out comes a reconstruction that
looks like a good reconstruction of the

432
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
looks like a good reconstruction of the
 

433
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,150
looks like a good reconstruction of the
cat image. So I think I've got a good

434
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
cat image. So I think I've got a good
 

435
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,190
cat image. So I think I've got a good
autoenccoder. Now I say great, I'm not

436
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,200
autoenccoder. Now I say great, I'm not
 

437
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,310
autoenccoder. Now I say great, I'm not
going to use the encoder. I'm not going

438
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
going to use the encoder. I'm not going
 

439
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,150
going to use the encoder. I'm not going
to run an actual cat in here at all.

440
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
to run an actual cat in here at all.
 

441
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,389
to run an actual cat in here at all.
I'll just take random noise and throw

442
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
I'll just take random noise and throw
 

443
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,150
I'll just take random noise and throw
that into Z. What happens? And what

444
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
that into Z. What happens? And what
 

445
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,990
that into Z. What happens? And what
happens is that you will get something

446
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
happens is that you will get something
 

447
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,269
happens is that you will get something
that just looks like a noise-like image.

448
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279

 

449
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,910

And the reason is that we have this uh

450
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
And the reason is that we have this uh
 

451
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,629
And the reason is that we have this uh
manifold hypothesis for natural images.

452
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
manifold hypothesis for natural images.
 

453
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,310
manifold hypothesis for natural images.
But even after we do the dimensionality

454
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
But even after we do the dimensionality
 

455
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,910
But even after we do the dimensionality
reduction, if we're in a category where

456
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
reduction, if we're in a category where
 

457
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,230
reduction, if we're in a category where
we get we're getting good images of cats

458
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
we get we're getting good images of cats
 

459
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,389
we get we're getting good images of cats
out from our autoenccoder,

460
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
out from our autoenccoder,
 

461
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,790
out from our autoenccoder,
we're still in a very low dimensional

462
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
we're still in a very low dimensional
 

463
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,189
we're still in a very low dimensional
subset of Z. The encoder is only

464
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
subset of Z. The encoder is only
 

465
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,389
subset of Z. The encoder is only
producing things in a very low

466
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
producing things in a very low
 

467
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,269
producing things in a very low
dimensional subset of Z.

468
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
dimensional subset of Z.
 

469
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,509
dimensional subset of Z.
And so when we draw something that's

470
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
And so when we draw something that's
 

471
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,910
And so when we draw something that's
from a random distribution like a

472
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
from a random distribution like a
 

473
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,069
from a random distribution like a
Gaussian for example, we'll get

474
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
Gaussian for example, we'll get
 

475
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,870
Gaussian for example, we'll get
something that looks nothing like the

476
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:28,880
something that looks nothing like the
 

477
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,710
something that looks nothing like the
Z's that the decoder saw during

478
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
Z's that the decoder saw during
 

479
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,310
Z's that the decoder saw during
training.

480
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
training.
 

481
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,230
training.
And so this is this kind of wild

482
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
And so this is this kind of wild
 

483
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,990
And so this is this kind of wild
extrapolation that neural networks are

484
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
extrapolation that neural networks are
 

485
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,430
extrapolation that neural networks are
bad at doing. All machine learning

486
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,440
bad at doing. All machine learning
 

487
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,590
bad at doing. All machine learning
methods are bad at doing. Like it

488
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
methods are bad at doing. Like it
 

489
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,269
methods are bad at doing. Like it
doesn't know what to do. So it just you

490
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
doesn't know what to do. So it just you
 

491
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,509
doesn't know what to do. So it just you
get something out that's not necessarily

492
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
get something out that's not necessarily
 

493
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,790
get something out that's not necessarily
a a cat. So you get a noise-like image.

494
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
a a cat. So you get a noise-like image.
 

495
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,470
a a cat. So you get a noise-like image.
You can also get images in some cases

496
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
You can also get images in some cases
 

497
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,230
You can also get images in some cases
that break a different way where they're

498
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:52,240
that break a different way where they're
 

499
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,590
that break a different way where they're
like, you know, blurry

500
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
like, you know, blurry
 

501
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,750
like, you know, blurry
Gaussian blob type things. Um, so lots

502
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
Gaussian blob type things. Um, so lots
 

503
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,470
Gaussian blob type things. Um, so lots
of ways, but it's never a cap.

504
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
of ways, but it's never a cap.
 

505
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,790
of ways, but it's never a cap.
Okay, so this everyone everyone good

506
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
Okay, so this everyone everyone good
 

507
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,470
Okay, so this everyone everyone good
with this these ideas that don't work?

508
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480
with this these ideas that don't work?
 

509
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,949
with this these ideas that don't work?
Yeah.

510
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
Yeah.
 

511
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,870
Yeah.
>> Does that hypothetically if you had the

512
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
>> Does that hypothetically if you had the
 

513
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,069
>> Does that hypothetically if you had the
exact correct internal dimension size C

514
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,079
exact correct internal dimension size C
 

515
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,829
exact correct internal dimension size C
then you this might hypothetically work.

516
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
then you this might hypothetically work.
 

517
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,350
then you this might hypothetically work.
>> Okay, it's a great question. So the

518
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
>> Okay, it's a great question. So the
 

519
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,949
>> Okay, it's a great question. So the
great question was I'll repeat it is

520
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
great question was I'll repeat it is
 

521
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,910
great question was I'll repeat it is
that if you if you had exactly the right

522
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
that if you if you had exactly the right
 

523
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,590
that if you if you had exactly the right
dimension Z, would this work? And the

524
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
dimension Z, would this work? And the
 

525
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,790
dimension Z, would this work? And the
problem is that the answer is no. Um and

526
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
problem is that the answer is no. Um and
 

527
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,509
problem is that the answer is no. Um and
the reason is dimensions go one, two,

528
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
the reason is dimensions go one, two,
 

529
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,030
the reason is dimensions go one, two,
three, four, five. So people done the

530
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
three, four, five. So people done the
 

531
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,750
three, four, five. So people done the
experiment where you try. Okay. And what

532
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:35,760
experiment where you try. Okay. And what
 

533
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,389
experiment where you try. Okay. And what
happens is that as you increase the

534
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
happens is that as you increase the
 

535
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,990
happens is that as you increase the
dimension of Z, the autoenccoder's

536
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
dimension of Z, the autoenccoder's
 

537
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,829
dimension of Z, the autoenccoder's
validation performance gets better and

538
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
validation performance gets better and
 

539
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,509
validation performance gets better and
better, right? And

540
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
better, right? And
 

541
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,350
better, right? And
but it doesn't get better and better.

542
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
but it doesn't get better and better.
 

543
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,430
but it doesn't get better and better.
First, it doesn't get better and better

544
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
First, it doesn't get better and better
 

545
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,269
First, it doesn't get better and better
in a dramatic jump way. It's like, okay,

546
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
in a dramatic jump way. It's like, okay,
 

547
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,470
in a dramatic jump way. It's like, okay,
it's getting better, better, better

548
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
it's getting better, better, better
 

549
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,870
it's getting better, better, better
better better, you know, better better

550
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
better better, you know, better better
 

551
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,629
better better, you know, better better
better better better better better

552
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
better better better better better
 

553
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,310
better better better better better
better better better for a while. And so

554
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
better better better for a while. And so
 

555
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,550
better better better for a while. And so
there isn't a crisp right thing even.

556
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
there isn't a crisp right thing even.
 

557
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,870
there isn't a crisp right thing even.
There's not a crisp right dimension from

558
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
There's not a crisp right dimension from
 

559
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,110
There's not a crisp right dimension from
the autoenccoders point of view either.

560
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
the autoenccoders point of view either.
 

561
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,389
the autoenccoders point of view either.
So that's your first indication this

562
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
So that's your first indication this
 

563
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,470
So that's your first indication this
probably not going to work. And what

564
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
probably not going to work. And what
 

565
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,110
probably not going to work. And what
happens is that the as a result the

566
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
happens is that the as a result the
 

567
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,870
happens is that the as a result the
trying this approach it just get you bad

568
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:16,880
trying this approach it just get you bad
 

569
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,790
trying this approach it just get you bad
image bad image bad image bad image bad

570
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
image bad image bad image bad image bad
 

571
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,310
image bad image bad image bad image bad
but they're like they start changing in

572
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
but they're like they start changing in
 

573
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,389
but they're like they start changing in
how they're bad but they're still all

574
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
how they're bad but they're still all
 

575
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,550
how they're bad but they're still all
bad.

576
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
bad.
 

577
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,189
bad.
So that doesn't work. Now one act one

578
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
So that doesn't work. Now one act one
 

579
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,550
So that doesn't work. Now one act one
way of thinking about it is that

580
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
way of thinking about it is that
 

581
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,550
way of thinking about it is that
discrete dimension isn't the right

582
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
discrete dimension isn't the right
 

583
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,269
discrete dimension isn't the right
thing. So you could imagine doing other

584
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
thing. So you could imagine doing other
 

585
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,590
thing. So you could imagine doing other
kind of regularizers to try to have a

586
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:35,600
kind of regularizers to try to have a
 

587
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,110
kind of regularizers to try to have a
softer way of controlling the size of

588
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
softer way of controlling the size of
 

589
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,829
softer way of controlling the size of
this bottleneck. And one way of thinking

590
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
this bottleneck. And one way of thinking
 

591
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,509
this bottleneck. And one way of thinking
about what a VAE does is it's kind of

592
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
about what a VAE does is it's kind of
 

593
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,550
about what a VAE does is it's kind of
like that a little bit.

594
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
like that a little bit.
 

595
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,710
like that a little bit.
But another way that I personally find

596
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
But another way that I personally find
 

597
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,670
But another way that I personally find
more useful to thinking about a VAE is

598
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:49,680
more useful to thinking about a VAE is
 

599
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,269
more useful to thinking about a VAE is
that we want to make sure that

600
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
that we want to make sure that
 

601
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,069
that we want to make sure that
if we sample something here,

602
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
if we sample something here,
 

603
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,749
if we sample something here,
it's

604
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
it's
 

605
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,269
it's
the decoder has to be robust to the

606
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
the decoder has to be robust to the
 

607
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,069
the decoder has to be robust to the
things we're introducing in in Z that

608
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
things we're introducing in in Z that
 

609
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,590
things we're introducing in in Z that
might not it might not have seen during

610
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
might not it might not have seen during
 

611
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,029
might not it might not have seen during
training.

612
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
training.
 

613
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,829
training.
So you can think of it, one way of

614
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
So you can think of it, one way of
 

615
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,470
So you can think of it, one way of
thinking about it is I want to do a data

616
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
thinking about it is I want to do a data
 

617
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,630
thinking about it is I want to do a data
augmentation

618
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
augmentation
 

619
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,309
augmentation
during autoenccoder training which is

620
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
during autoenccoder training which is
 

621
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,949
during autoenccoder training which is
designed to make the decoder more

622
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
designed to make the decoder more
 

623
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,909
designed to make the decoder more
robust. Okay, that's one lens to think

624
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
robust. Okay, that's one lens to think
 

625
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,949
robust. Okay, that's one lens to think
about it. Another lens to think about it

626
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
about it. Another lens to think about it
 

627
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,830
about it. Another lens to think about it
um same words just said diff kind of

628
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:29,840
um same words just said diff kind of
 

629
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,830
um same words just said diff kind of
same idea but just said differently is I

630
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
same idea but just said differently is I
 

631
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,750
same idea but just said differently is I
would like to make the decoder more

632
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
would like to make the decoder more
 

633
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,270
would like to make the decoder more
robust to uh kind of variations in Z and

634
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
robust to uh kind of variations in Z and
 

635
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,870
robust to uh kind of variations in Z and
I want to make it see more like what

636
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
I want to make it see more like what
 

637
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,310
I want to make it see more like what
it's going to see during generation

638
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
it's going to see during generation
 

639
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,270
it's going to see during generation
time.

640
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
time.
 

641
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,789
time.
So

642
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
So
 

643
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,630
So
the key ideas that I mentioned last time

644
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
the key ideas that I mentioned last time
 

645
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,909
the key ideas that I mentioned last time
very fast is that

646
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
very fast is that
 

647
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,870
very fast is that
first we need to somehow make Z random

648
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880
first we need to somehow make Z random
 

649
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,310
first we need to somehow make Z random
during training too. We're gonna it's

650
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
during training too. We're gonna it's
 

651
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,590
during training too. We're gonna it's
going to be random during testing when

652
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
going to be random during testing when
 

653
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,669
going to be random during testing when
we generate a new image. So we need to

654
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
we generate a new image. So we need to
 

655
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,110
we generate a new image. So we need to
make it random during training. So it's

656
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
make it random during training. So it's
 

657
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,190
make it random during training. So it's
like what it's going to see later. So we

658
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
like what it's going to see later. So we
 

659
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,870
like what it's going to see later. So we
have to add some randomness to Z. Some

660
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:02,880
have to add some randomness to Z. Some
 

661
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,270
have to add some randomness to Z. Some
things out of random Z.

662
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
things out of random Z.
 

663
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,110
things out of random Z.
Second is that when we're going to be

664
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
Second is that when we're going to be
 

665
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,950
Second is that when we're going to be
using it,

666
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
using it,
 

667
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,510
using it,
we're going to be using

668
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
we're going to be using
 

669
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,070
we're going to be using
Z by sampling from a particular

670
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
Z by sampling from a particular
 

671
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,230
Z by sampling from a particular
distribution.

672
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
distribution.
 

673
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,590
distribution.
We have a lot of freedom in choosing

674
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
We have a lot of freedom in choosing
 

675
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,110
We have a lot of freedom in choosing
what distribution it is, but it's going

676
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,120
what distribution it is, but it's going
 

677
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,270
what distribution it is, but it's going
to be some distribution.

678
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280
to be some distribution.
 

679
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,510
to be some distribution.
So we want the Z's that the decoder sees

680
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
So we want the Z's that the decoder sees
 

681
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,789
So we want the Z's that the decoder sees
during training to be like Z's from that

682
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
during training to be like Z's from that
 

683
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,549
during training to be like Z's from that
distribution. It's not just it should be

684
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
distribution. It's not just it should be
 

685
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,830
distribution. It's not just it should be
random. It should be like the

686
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
random. It should be like the
 

687
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,830
random. It should be like the
distribution we're going to use. So we

688
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
distribution we're going to use. So we
 

689
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,430
distribution we're going to use. So we
have to add some kind of loss on the

690
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
have to add some kind of loss on the
 

691
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,070
have to add some kind of loss on the
distribution of Z that makes it move

692
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
distribution of Z that makes it move
 

693
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,350
distribution of Z that makes it move
towards the distribution we're going to

694
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360
towards the distribution we're going to
 

695
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,270
towards the distribution we're going to
be sampling from.

696
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,280
be sampling from.
 

697
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,549
be sampling from.
Okay? So we have to make this choice of

698
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
Okay? So we have to make this choice of
 

699
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,750
Okay? So we have to make this choice of
what to sample from and we have to have

700
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
what to sample from and we have to have
 

701
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,909
what to sample from and we have to have
a loss.

702
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
a loss.
 

703
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,029
a loss.
And the third thing we have to do is we

704
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
And the third thing we have to do is we
 

705
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,510
And the third thing we have to do is we
have to make all of this work with SGD

706
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
have to make all of this work with SGD
 

707
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,390
have to make all of this work with SGD
style training because implicit in what

708
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
style training because implicit in what
 

709
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,830
style training because implicit in what
I'm saying is that we're going to be

710
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:57,840
I'm saying is that we're going to be
 

711
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,510
I'm saying is that we're going to be
doing some random thing here which

712
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
doing some random thing here which
 

713
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,110
doing some random thing here which
involves some kind of you can't just

714
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
involves some kind of you can't just
 

715
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,150
involves some kind of you can't just
feed a distribution into a decoder. You

716
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
feed a distribution into a decoder. You
 

717
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,230
feed a distribution into a decoder. You
have to feed something into the decoder.

718
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
have to feed something into the decoder.
 

719
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,750
have to feed something into the decoder.
So your mind should be thinking uhoh

720
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
So your mind should be thinking uhoh
 

721
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,549
So your mind should be thinking uhoh
we're going to be doing sampling.

722
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
we're going to be doing sampling.
 

723
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,830
we're going to be doing sampling.
But remember we talked about auto

724
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
But remember we talked about auto
 

725
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,750
But remember we talked about auto
reggressive generation. We said sampling

726
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
reggressive generation. We said sampling
 

727
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,710
reggressive generation. We said sampling
you can't run a gradient through.

728
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
you can't run a gradient through.
 

729
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,870
you can't run a gradient through.
Okay. So we have to be careful in how we

730
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
Okay. So we have to be careful in how we
 

731
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,150
Okay. So we have to be careful in how we
do this to make sure that we can run

732
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
do this to make sure that we can run
 

733
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,990
do this to make sure that we can run
gradients. So it's like a a warning in

734
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
gradients. So it's like a a warning in
 

735
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,270
gradients. So it's like a a warning in
our mind. We have to make sure we can do

736
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
our mind. We have to make sure we can do
 

737
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,870
our mind. We have to make sure we can do
this.

738
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
this.
 

739
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,549
this.
Okay. Any questions on the sort of the

740
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
Okay. Any questions on the sort of the
 

741
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,430
Okay. Any questions on the sort of the
ditterata here we're trying to do.

742
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440

 

743
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,070

>> Yeah.

744
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
>> Yeah.
 

745
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,870
>> Yeah.
>> Um I guess this is us kind of trying to

746
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
>> Um I guess this is us kind of trying to
 

747
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,029
>> Um I guess this is us kind of trying to
uh find a distribution of Z itself like

748
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
uh find a distribution of Z itself like
 

749
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,669
uh find a distribution of Z itself like
would something like a patch normous

750
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
would something like a patch normous
 

751
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,789
would something like a patch normous
approach where uh where we see oh this

752
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
approach where uh where we see oh this
 

753
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,950
approach where uh where we see oh this
is the kind of Z that we saw during

754
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
is the kind of Z that we saw during
 

755
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,669
is the kind of Z that we saw during
training and we try to like sample from

756
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
training and we try to like sample from
 

757
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,750
training and we try to like sample from
a distribution which is similar to that.

758
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
a distribution which is similar to that.
 

759
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,190
a distribution which is similar to that.
>> Okay that's a good question. So the

760
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
>> Okay that's a good question. So the
 

761
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,230
>> Okay that's a good question. So the
question is and people have tried to

762
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
question is and people have tried to
 

763
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,669
question is and people have tried to
approach it like this. So the question

764
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
approach it like this. So the question
 

765
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,029
approach it like this. So the question
is to say instead of trying to pick a

766
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
is to say instead of trying to pick a
 

767
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,630
is to say instead of trying to pick a
distribution that we're going to sample

768
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
distribution that we're going to sample
 

769
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,350
distribution that we're going to sample
from and then make our decoder generate

770
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
from and then make our decoder generate
 

771
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,230
from and then make our decoder generate
from that, why don't we try to have a

772
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
from that, why don't we try to have a
 

773
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,270
from that, why don't we try to have a
distribution that's like the

774
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,280
distribution that's like the
 

775
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,950
distribution that's like the
distribution that we saw from our

776
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
distribution that we saw from our
 

777
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,270
distribution that we saw from our
encoder itself. So in particular we have

778
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
encoder itself. So in particular we have
 

779
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,310
encoder itself. So in particular we have
an empirical we've trained this thing.

780
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,320
an empirical we've trained this thing.
 

781
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,510
an empirical we've trained this thing.
Suppose we didn't do any of this stuff.

782
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520
Suppose we didn't do any of this stuff.
 

783
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,909
Suppose we didn't do any of this stuff.
We just trained this thing and we have a

784
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
We just trained this thing and we have a
 

785
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,669
We just trained this thing and we have a
whole collection of images and so we

786
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
whole collection of images and so we
 

787
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,470
whole collection of images and so we
actually have a whole collection of Z's

788
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
actually have a whole collection of Z's
 

789
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,110
actually have a whole collection of Z's
that those images generated.

790
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
that those images generated.
 

791
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,190
that those images generated.
So we could say that let me draw from

792
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
So we could say that let me draw from
 

793
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,110
So we could say that let me draw from
that distribution first try. Let me draw

794
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,120
that distribution first try. Let me draw
 

795
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,990
that distribution first try. Let me draw
from that distribution. Well, you

796
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000
from that distribution. Well, you
 

797
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,270
from that distribution. Well, you
already know why this is not going to

798
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,280
already know why this is not going to
 

799
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,549
already know why this is not going to
work. If you drew from that

800
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
work. If you drew from that
 

801
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,070
work. If you drew from that
distribution, you're just going to get

802
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
distribution, you're just going to get
 

803
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,750
distribution, you're just going to get
back a copy of one of your training

804
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
back a copy of one of your training
 

805
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,549
back a copy of one of your training
images.

806
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
images.
 

807
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,630
images.
So that's not good. It doesn't work for

808
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
So that's not good. It doesn't work for
 

809
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,310
So that's not good. It doesn't work for
us. We need to be able to generate novel

810
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
us. We need to be able to generate novel
 

811
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,310
us. We need to be able to generate novel
samples, not just samples that we've

812
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
samples, not just samples that we've
 

813
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,149
samples, not just samples that we've
used to train. Okay. So then you'd say,

814
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
used to train. Okay. So then you'd say,
 

815
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,230
used to train. Okay. So then you'd say,
well, maybe I can try to fit some kind

816
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,240
well, maybe I can try to fit some kind
 

817
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,110
well, maybe I can try to fit some kind
of local density, use some kind of local

818
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
of local density, use some kind of local
 

819
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,270
of local density, use some kind of local
density estimation techniques to try to

820
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,280
density estimation techniques to try to
 

821
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,750
density estimation techniques to try to
fit a local density around this thing.

822
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
fit a local density around this thing.
 

823
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,110
fit a local density around this thing.
But then you've just reduced the same

824
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
But then you've just reduced the same
 

825
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,470
But then you've just reduced the same
problem we had at the beginning,

826
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
problem we had at the beginning,
 

827
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,909
problem we had at the beginning,
right? Just to have a distribution

828
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
right? Just to have a distribution
 

829
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,350
right? Just to have a distribution
around this. All we've done is

830
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
around this. All we've done is
 

831
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,470
around this. All we've done is
dimensionality reduced it. Okay? So it

832
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
dimensionality reduced it. Okay? So it
 

833
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,029
dimensionality reduced it. Okay? So it
still doesn't solve our problem. We just

834
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,039
still doesn't solve our problem. We just
 

835
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,110
still doesn't solve our problem. We just
return the same problem again. Okay. But

836
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
return the same problem again. Okay. But
 

837
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,029
return the same problem again. Okay. But
let's just you know hold on to the idea

838
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:27,039
let's just you know hold on to the idea
 

839
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,390
let's just you know hold on to the idea
about thinking about this distribution.

840
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
about thinking about this distribution.
 

841
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,830
about thinking about this distribution.
This will become important. We talk

842
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:29,840
This will become important. We talk
 

843
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,230
This will become important. We talk
about latent space diffusion later.

844
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,240
about latent space diffusion later.
 

845
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,630
about latent space diffusion later.
Okay. But first we have to kind of solve

846
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
Okay. But first we have to kind of solve
 

847
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,430
Okay. But first we have to kind of solve
this problem of you know actually making

848
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
this problem of you know actually making
 

849
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,029
this problem of you know actually making
having some control on Z.

850
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,039
having some control on Z.
 

851
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,590
having some control on Z.
Okay. So here's the picture

852
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
Okay. So here's the picture
 

853
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,110
Okay. So here's the picture
that we want. So

854
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120

 

855
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,270

this path

856
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
this path
 

857
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,870
this path
looks very similar to the autoenccoder

858
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
looks very similar to the autoenccoder
 

859
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,270
looks very similar to the autoenccoder
path we had before. The difference is

860
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
path we had before. The difference is
 

861
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,029
path we had before. The difference is
that instead of just having the encoder

862
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
that instead of just having the encoder
 

863
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,630
that instead of just having the encoder
generate something that goes straight

864
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
generate something that goes straight
 

865
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,350
generate something that goes straight
into the decoder, we have the encoder

866
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
into the decoder, we have the encoder
 

867
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,990
into the decoder, we have the encoder
generating a distribution whose samples

868
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000
generating a distribution whose samples
 

869
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,149
generating a distribution whose samples
go into the decoder.

870
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:08,159
go into the decoder.
 

871
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,830
go into the decoder.
Okay, so that's like what happens on

872
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:09,840
Okay, so that's like what happens on
 

873
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,149
Okay, so that's like what happens on
this main path. That's the difference.

874
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:12,159
this main path. That's the difference.
 

875
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,830
this main path. That's the difference.
And we decided to add instead of just

876
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
And we decided to add instead of just
 

877
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,750
And we decided to add instead of just
our usual you know loss of

878
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:15,760
our usual you know loss of
 

879
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,630
our usual you know loss of
self-supervision adding a new loss that

880
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,640
self-supervision adding a new loss that
 

881
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,230
self-supervision adding a new loss that
takes in a new ingredient which is a

882
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:20,240
takes in a new ingredient which is a
 

883
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,789
takes in a new ingredient which is a
desired distribution.

884
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:22,799
desired distribution.
 

885
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,270
desired distribution.
Okay this is the kind of approach that

886
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
Okay this is the kind of approach that
 

887
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,669
Okay this is the kind of approach that
we're going to take. Now notice

888
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
we're going to take. Now notice
 

889
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,110
we're going to take. Now notice
something here. You'll notice something

890
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,120
something here. You'll notice something
 

891
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,669
something here. You'll notice something
which is that you might say, "Wait a

892
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
which is that you might say, "Wait a
 

893
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,110
which is that you might say, "Wait a
minute, this isn't exactly what we

894
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
minute, this isn't exactly what we
 

895
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,430
minute, this isn't exactly what we
wanted."

896
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
wanted."
 

897
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,830
wanted."
Right? What we actually said we wanted

898
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:39,840
Right? What we actually said we wanted
 

899
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,789
Right? What we actually said we wanted
was to have the something so the

900
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:42,799
was to have the something so the
 

901
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,590
was to have the something so the
distribution of Z that comes over all

902
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,600
distribution of Z that comes over all
 

903
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,990
distribution of Z that comes over all
the X's we ever use is like the

904
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
the X's we ever use is like the
 

905
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,390
the X's we ever use is like the
distribution we want. Does everyone see

906
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
distribution we want. Does everyone see
 

907
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,029
distribution we want. Does everyone see
this distinction? Whereas here what I

908
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
this distinction? Whereas here what I
 

909
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,750
this distinction? Whereas here what I
have is the conditional distribution

910
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:55,760
have is the conditional distribution
 

911
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,390
have is the conditional distribution
conditioned on this X

912
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
conditioned on this X
 

913
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,870
conditioned on this X
is like the distribution I want which is

914
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:00,880
is like the distribution I want which is
 

915
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,270
is like the distribution I want which is
very different.

916
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
very different.
 

917
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,630
very different.
Everyone see this? You should be aware

918
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
Everyone see this? You should be aware
 

919
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,070
Everyone see this? You should be aware
of this challenge this difference. And

920
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
of this challenge this difference. And
 

921
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,430
of this challenge this difference. And
so from a deep learning perspective, one

922
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
so from a deep learning perspective, one
 

923
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,789
so from a deep learning perspective, one
way of understanding what we're doing

924
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
way of understanding what we're doing
 

925
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,909
way of understanding what we're doing
here is to say yes that is a challenge

926
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:17,919
here is to say yes that is a challenge
 

927
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,510
here is to say yes that is a challenge
but I can do this.

928
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:21,520
but I can do this.
 

929
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,149
but I can do this.
Okay, operationally I can do this.

930
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:24,159
Okay, operationally I can do this.
 

931
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,149
Okay, operationally I can do this.
Trying to have a loss on the

932
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
Trying to have a loss on the
 

933
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,549
Trying to have a loss on the
distribution of X

934
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:28,559
distribution of X
 

935
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,070
distribution of X
averaged over all of the things entering

936
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
averaged over all of the things entering
 

937
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,070
averaged over all of the things entering
this encoder and those the kind of

938
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
this encoder and those the kind of
 

939
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,390
this encoder and those the kind of
mixture of distributions. that's hard to

940
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,400
mixture of distributions. that's hard to
 

941
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,510
mixture of distributions. that's hard to
do to put a loss on that. So I'll just

942
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,520
do to put a loss on that. So I'll just
 

943
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,669
do to put a loss on that. So I'll just
do this and see what happens. That's one

944
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:41,679
do this and see what happens. That's one
 

945
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,270
do this and see what happens. That's one
way of thinking about it. The other way

946
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,280
way of thinking about it. The other way
 

947
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,630
way of thinking about it. The other way
to think about this, this is actually

948
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:44,640
to think about this, this is actually
 

949
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,470
to think about this, this is actually
where the name variational autoenccoder

950
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:46,480
where the name variational autoenccoder
 

951
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,149
where the name variational autoenccoder
comes from, is that this kind of

952
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:48,159
comes from, is that this kind of
 

953
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,149
comes from, is that this kind of
technique has been done in statistics

954
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:50,159
technique has been done in statistics
 

955
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,270
technique has been done in statistics
before and so there's like reasons to

956
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,280
before and so there's like reasons to
 

957
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,190
before and so there's like reasons to
believe things like this will work.

958
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
believe things like this will work.
 

959
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,750
believe things like this will work.
Okay. If you've seen EM, it's related to

960
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
Okay. If you've seen EM, it's related to
 

961
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,350
Okay. If you've seen EM, it's related to
things in there. Yeah.

962
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
things in there. Yeah.
 

963
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,270
things in there. Yeah.
>> So we're saying you're taking a loss on

964
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,280
>> So we're saying you're taking a loss on
 

965
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,070

the distribution. Is it like a loss of

966
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
the distribution. Is it like a loss of
 

967
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,950
the distribution. Is it like a loss of
the output of the encoder opposed to

968
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:06,960
the output of the encoder opposed to
 

969

975
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,110

saying that the output of the encoder

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,120
saying that the output of the encoder
 

977
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,590
saying that the output of the encoder
has to be something I can sample from.

978
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
has to be something I can sample from.
 

979
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,149
has to be something I can sample from.
Okay, we call that a distribution.

980
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
Okay, we call that a distribution.
 

981
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,310
Okay, we call that a distribution.
I have to parameterize it somehow,

982
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
I have to parameterize it somehow,
 

983
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,830
I have to parameterize it somehow,
right? And I have to parameterize this

984
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
right? And I have to parameterize this
 

985
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,510
right? And I have to parameterize this
somehow so I can compute this loss

986
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
somehow so I can compute this loss
 

987
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,750
somehow so I can compute this loss
somehow. But right now I'm just thinking

988
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
somehow. But right now I'm just thinking
 

989
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,110
somehow. But right now I'm just thinking
that it's at the level of distributions.

990
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
that it's at the level of distributions.
 

991
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,669
that it's at the level of distributions.
A distribution pops out.

992
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
A distribution pops out.
 

993
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,269
A distribution pops out.
We have a target distribution and we

994
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
We have a target distribution and we
 

995
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,710
We have a target distribution and we
have to compute it loss somehow.

996
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720
have to compute it loss somehow.
 

997
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,549
have to compute it loss somehow.
So now

998
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:38,559
So now
 

999
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,830
So now
we have to choose both the loss and the

1000
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:41,840
we have to choose both the loss and the
 

1001
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,789
we have to choose both the loss and the
desired distribution to make this kind

1002
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
desired distribution to make this kind
 

1003
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,950
desired distribution to make this kind
of thing work.

1004
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:46,960
of thing work.
 

1005
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,630
of thing work.
So we can think about what is some of

1006
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:50,640
So we can think about what is some of
 

1007
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,390
So we can think about what is some of
the derata. We have freedom here. We get

1008
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,400
the derata. We have freedom here. We get
 

1009
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,630
the derata. We have freedom here. We get
to choose the distribution

1010
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
to choose the distribution
 

1011
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,110
to choose the distribution
for things like images. And in general,

1012
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
for things like images. And in general,
 

1013
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,110
for things like images. And in general,
we want the distribution to be something

1014
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
we want the distribution to be something
 

1015
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,149
we want the distribution to be something
that's continuous and easy to sample.

1016
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
that's continuous and easy to sample.
 

1017
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,230
that's continuous and easy to sample.
Why? Because we know that from a

1018
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,240
Why? Because we know that from a
 

1019
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,909
Why? Because we know that from a
continuous distribution, we can generate

1020
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919
continuous distribution, we can generate
 

1021
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,590
continuous distribution, we can generate
from any continuous distribution, we can

1022
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:07,600
from any continuous distribution, we can
 

1023
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,029
from any continuous distribution, we can
generate any other distribution we want

1024
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
generate any other distribution we want
 

1025
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,269
generate any other distribution we want
by some transformation.

1026
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:11,279
by some transformation.
 

1027
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,990
by some transformation.
Okay, so we continuous distributions are

1028
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,000
Okay, so we continuous distributions are
 

1029
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,310
Okay, so we continuous distributions are
nice. Also, we're looking forward to

1030
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
nice. Also, we're looking forward to
 

1031
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,909
nice. Also, we're looking forward to
having gradients and continuity might be

1032
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:17,919
having gradients and continuity might be
 

1033
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,310
having gradients and continuity might be
nice. You can eventually get around this

1034
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:20,320
nice. You can eventually get around this
 

1035
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,310
nice. You can eventually get around this
problem, but just for right now, we'll

1036
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
problem, but just for right now, we'll
 

1037
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,750
problem, but just for right now, we'll
uh we'll say this as our first thing

1038
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
uh we'll say this as our first thing
 

1039
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,909
uh we'll say this as our first thing
that we want to do.

1040
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:25,919
that we want to do.
 

1041
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,350
that we want to do.
definitely want it to be easy to sample

1042
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
definitely want it to be easy to sample
 

1043
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,669
definitely want it to be easy to sample
because we want to use it and we also

1044
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,679
because we want to use it and we also
 

1045
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,669
because we want to use it and we also
want it to be easy to compute this loss

1046
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
want it to be easy to compute this loss
 

1047
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,669
want it to be easy to compute this loss
somehow

1048
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:35,679

 

1049
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,230

because you have to implement it.

1050
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:38,240
because you have to implement it.
 

1051
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,870
because you have to implement it.
Okay, so now comes the question of how

1052
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
Okay, so now comes the question of how
 

1053
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,950
Okay, so now comes the question of how
do I think about losses on distributions

1054
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
do I think about losses on distributions
 

1055
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,909
do I think about losses on distributions
and what are my go-to things? So here we

1056
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:47,919
and what are my go-to things? So here we
 

1057
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,110
and what are my go-to things? So here we
had you in discussion look at uh KL

1058
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,120
had you in discussion look at uh KL
 

1059
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,190
had you in discussion look at uh KL
divergence,

1060
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
divergence,
 

1061
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,269
divergence,
right? You might have seen this before.

1062
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
right? You might have seen this before.
 

1063
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,430
right? You might have seen this before.
You saw you seen entropy before. KL

1064
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,440
You saw you seen entropy before. KL
 

1065
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,630
You saw you seen entropy before. KL
divergence just kind of goes off of

1066
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:58,640
divergence just kind of goes off of
 

1067
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,310
divergence just kind of goes off of
entropy. So I'm going to write KL

1068
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
entropy. So I'm going to write KL
 

1069
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,070
entropy. So I'm going to write KL
divergence in sort of integral form

1070
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,080
divergence in sort of integral form
 

1071
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,830
divergence in sort of integral form
here.

1072
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:03,840
here.
 

1073
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,350
here.
And

1074
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:05,360
And
 

1075
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,830
And
it's a one of the natural kind of loss

1076
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:07,840
it's a one of the natural kind of loss
 

1077
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,230
it's a one of the natural kind of loss
functions we have when we think about

1078
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,240
functions we have when we think about
 

1079
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,669
functions we have when we think about
distributions and how close

1080
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
distributions and how close
 

1081
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,590
distributions and how close
distributions are from one to the other.

1082
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
distributions are from one to the other.
 

1083
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,909
distributions are from one to the other.
So when you have a loss, you have to

1084
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:17,919
So when you have a loss, you have to
 

1085
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,990
So when you have a loss, you have to
have two things. The thing you're

1086
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
have two things. The thing you're
 

1087
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,149
have two things. The thing you're
measuring the loss of and the target.

1088
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:22,159
measuring the loss of and the target.
 

1089
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,430
measuring the loss of and the target.
Okay. So here we have KL has two things.

1090
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,440
Okay. So here we have KL has two things.
 

1091
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,630
Okay. So here we have KL has two things.
It has a Q and a P. And what it does is

1092
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:28,640
It has a Q and a P. And what it does is
 

1093
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,230
It has a Q and a P. And what it does is
it says how close are Q and P to each

1094
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,240
it says how close are Q and P to each
 

1095
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,390
it says how close are Q and P to each
other. So you can think about if Q and P

1096
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,400
other. So you can think about if Q and P
 

1097
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,470
other. So you can think about if Q and P
are the same, we want the loss to come

1098
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
are the same, we want the loss to come
 

1099
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,390
are the same, we want the loss to come
out as zero.

1100
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
out as zero.
 

1101
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,710
out as zero.
Okay? Like that's something we want. So

1102
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:40,720
Okay? Like that's something we want. So
 

1103
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,630
Okay? Like that's something we want. So
in this formula, what we're going to do

1104
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
in this formula, what we're going to do
 

1105
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,789
in this formula, what we're going to do
is we're going to look at the ratio of Q

1106
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
is we're going to look at the ratio of Q
 

1107
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,310
is we're going to look at the ratio of Q
and P. So if Q and P evaluate to the

1108
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
and P. So if Q and P evaluate to the
 

1109
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,990
and P. So if Q and P evaluate to the
same probabilities on everything, the

1110
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,000
same probabilities on everything, the
 

1111
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,390
same probabilities on everything, the
ratio will be one. Everyone good with

1112
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:52,400
ratio will be one. Everyone good with
 

1113
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,710
ratio will be one. Everyone good with
that? And we take the log of that

1114
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:54,720
that? And we take the log of that
 

1115
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,470
that? And we take the log of that
because the log of one is zero.

1116
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,480
because the log of one is zero.
 

1117
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,470
because the log of one is zero.
So if these two are the same, this is

1118
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,480
So if these two are the same, this is
 

1119
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,470
So if these two are the same, this is
always zero. And then I take an

1120
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,480
always zero. And then I take an
 

1121
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,789
always zero. And then I take an
expectation over it with respect to some

1122
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:04,799
expectation over it with respect to some
 

1123
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,110
expectation over it with respect to some
distribution. I pick the distribution Q.

1124
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
distribution. I pick the distribution Q.
 

1125
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,870
distribution. I pick the distribution Q.
So if Q and P are the same, I'll get

1126
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:10,880
So if Q and P are the same, I'll get
 

1127
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,510
So if Q and P are the same, I'll get
zero.

1128
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,520
zero.
 

1129
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,269
zero.
That's like one basic fun feature of a

1130
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
That's like one basic fun feature of a
 

1131
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,230
That's like one basic fun feature of a
loss function I care about. Um but you

1132
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
loss function I care about. Um but you
 

1133
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,950
loss function I care about. Um but you
know there are more. Uh so you can think

1134
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
know there are more. Uh so you can think
 

1135
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,070
know there are more. Uh so you can think
about it many different ways. From a

1136
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,080
about it many different ways. From a
 

1137
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,830
about it many different ways. From a
deep learning perspective, you can think

1138
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:23,840
deep learning perspective, you can think
 

1139
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,510
deep learning perspective, you can think
about what's nice about KL is that it

1140
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:27,520
about what's nice about KL is that it
 

1141
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,590
about what's nice about KL is that it
exists

1142
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
exists
 

1143
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,470
exists
and you can compute it. Okay? And then

1144
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
and you can compute it. Okay? And then
 

1145
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,870
and you can compute it. Okay? And then
you can see how well it works. Like you

1146
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
you can see how well it works. Like you
 

1147
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,390
you can see how well it works. Like you
have to pick something. You might as

1148
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:36,400
have to pick something. You might as
 

1149
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,669
have to pick something. You might as
well pick things that have worked. You

1150
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:37,679
well pick things that have worked. You
 

1151
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,950
well pick things that have worked. You
pick things that have worked elsewhere.

1152
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:38,960
pick things that have worked elsewhere.
 

1153
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,149
pick things that have worked elsewhere.
There's many other distributions one

1154
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:40,159
There's many other distributions one
 

1155
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,149
There's many other distributions one
could distances one could use, but this

1156
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
could distances one could use, but this
 

1157
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,430
could distances one could use, but this
is one. Um and there are many variants

1158
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,440
is one. Um and there are many variants
 

1159
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,070
is one. Um and there are many variants
and people do use many variants.

1160
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,080
and people do use many variants.
 

1161
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,750
and people do use many variants.
So

1162
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
So
 

1163
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,029
So
one thing about this particular uh

1164
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
one thing about this particular uh
 

1165
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,710
one thing about this particular uh
distance from a deep learning

1166
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
distance from a deep learning
 

1167
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,269
distance from a deep learning
perspective and in general is that it's

1168
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:57,279
perspective and in general is that it's
 

1169
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,190
perspective and in general is that it's
not symmetric

1170
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,200
not symmetric
 

1171
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,190
not symmetric
and you saw that in discussion it's it's

1172
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
and you saw that in discussion it's it's
 

1173
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,669
and you saw that in discussion it's it's
not symmetric and so there's a question

1174
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:03,679
not symmetric and so there's a question
 

1175
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,830
not symmetric and so there's a question
of whether you want distributions to be

1176
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:05,840
of whether you want distributions to be
 

1177
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,149
of whether you want distributions to be
symmetric losses on distributions to be

1178
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
symmetric losses on distributions to be
 

1179
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,190
symmetric losses on distributions to be
symmetric or not and kale divergence if

1180
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
symmetric or not and kale divergence if
 

1181
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,269
symmetric or not and kale divergence if
you haven't seen this before actually

1182
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,279
you haven't seen this before actually
 

1183
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,070
you haven't seen this before actually
captures a very natural asymmetry that

1184
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,080
captures a very natural asymmetry that
 

1185
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,350
captures a very natural asymmetry that
exists in probability itself. And you

1186
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,360
exists in probability itself. And you
 

1187
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,990
exists in probability itself. And you
can think of it this way. If I have a

1188
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000
can think of it this way. If I have a
 

1189
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,549
can think of it this way. If I have a
coin that I'm tossing and the coin is

1190
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
coin that I'm tossing and the coin is
 

1191
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,990
coin that I'm tossing and the coin is
equal heads or tails probability,

1192
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
equal heads or tails probability,
 

1193
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,029
equal heads or tails probability,
okay? And I toss it.

1194
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:33,039
okay? And I toss it.
 

1195
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,789
okay? And I toss it.
And I have another coin that has some

1196
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
And I have another coin that has some
 

1197
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,470
And I have another coin that has some
unequal heads and tails probability.

1198
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
unequal heads and tails probability.
 

1199
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,149
unequal heads and tails probability.
It's natural to ask how far apart are

1200
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:38,159
It's natural to ask how far apart are
 

1201
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,070
It's natural to ask how far apart are
these two coins. Is that good? Now, why

1202
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
these two coins. Is that good? Now, why
 

1203
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,950
these two coins. Is that good? Now, why
would you think of this as being

1204
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:42,960
would you think of this as being
 

1205
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,110
would you think of this as being
asymmetric? One way to think about

1206
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,120
asymmetric? One way to think about
 

1207
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,430
asymmetric? One way to think about
telling two probabilities apart is you

1208
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
telling two probabilities apart is you
 

1209
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,549
telling two probabilities apart is you
want to know something about the chance

1210
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:48,559
want to know something about the chance
 

1211
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,549
want to know something about the chance
you'll get confused learning from data

1212
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:50,559
you'll get confused learning from data
 

1213
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,070
you'll get confused learning from data
about which one it is. Everyone see

1214
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,080
about which one it is. Everyone see
 

1215
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,750
about which one it is. Everyone see
this?

1216
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:53,760
this?
 

1217
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,230
this?
So the question is is this asymmetric or

1218
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,240
So the question is is this asymmetric or
 

1219
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,950
So the question is is this asymmetric or
is it symmetric? And the answer is it's

1220
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
is it symmetric? And the answer is it's
 

1221
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,029
is it symmetric? And the answer is it's
definitely asymmetric because if I tell

1222
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:01,039
definitely asymmetric because if I tell
 

1223
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,909
definitely asymmetric because if I tell
you I can toss a coin twice.

1224
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:03,919
you I can toss a coin twice.
 

1225
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,269
you I can toss a coin twice.
Okay, that's your data. It's tossing a

1226
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:05,279
Okay, that's your data. It's tossing a
 

1227
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,190
Okay, that's your data. It's tossing a
coin twice and one coin has

1228
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,200
coin twice and one coin has
 

1229
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,990
coin twice and one coin has
heads on both sides and one coin has

1230
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
heads on both sides and one coin has
 

1231
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,830
heads on both sides and one coin has
heads and tails.

1232
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:13,840
heads and tails.
 

1233
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,870
heads and tails.
Okay, you only toss it twice.

1234
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
Okay, you only toss it twice.
 

1235
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,470
Okay, you only toss it twice.
Is there a chance when you toss the coin

1236
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
Is there a chance when you toss the coin
 

1237
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,470
Is there a chance when you toss the coin
that's fair that you'll be confused

1238
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
that's fair that you'll be confused
 

1239
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,950
that's fair that you'll be confused
about whether it's the two-headed coin?

1240
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:22,960
about whether it's the two-headed coin?
 

1241
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,110
about whether it's the two-headed coin?
The answer is yes.

1242
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,120
The answer is yes.
 

1243
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,990
The answer is yes.
But if you toss the two-headed coin

1244
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,000
But if you toss the two-headed coin
 

1245
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,669
But if you toss the two-headed coin
twice or a hundred times, right? Is it

1246
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
twice or a hundred times, right? Is it
 

1247
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,470
twice or a hundred times, right? Is it
ever going to look like the coin that

1248
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:34,480
ever going to look like the coin that
 

1249
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,510
ever going to look like the coin that
has heads and tails? The answer is no.

1250
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
has heads and tails? The answer is no.
 

1251
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,950
has heads and tails? The answer is no.
See, there's a small chance the heads

1252
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,960
See, there's a small chance the heads
 

1253
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,710
See, there's a small chance the heads
and tails one will give you all heads,

1254
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:40,720
and tails one will give you all heads,
 

1255
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,070
and tails one will give you all heads,
but the heads heads one's going to only

1256
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,080
but the heads heads one's going to only
 

1257
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,750
but the heads heads one's going to only
give you all heads. So, there's

1258
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,760
give you all heads. So, there's
 

1259
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,470
give you all heads. So, there's
definitely asymmetry in probability in

1260
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,480
definitely asymmetry in probability in
 

1261
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,710
definitely asymmetry in probability in
in what's close to what. Does everyone

1262
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720
in what's close to what. Does everyone
 

1263
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,190
in what's close to what. Does everyone
see that kale divergence is capturing

1264
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,200
see that kale divergence is capturing
 

1265
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,269
see that kale divergence is capturing
exactly that kind of asymmetry.

1266
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
exactly that kind of asymmetry.
 

1267
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,430
exactly that kind of asymmetry.
Um, this is probably talked about more

1268
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:57,440
Um, this is probably talked about more
 

1269
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,750
Um, this is probably talked about more
in 126, so I don't want to dwell on it,

1270
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,760
in 126, so I don't want to dwell on it,
 

1271
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,830
in 126, so I don't want to dwell on it,
but this is uh the from a deep learning

1272
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:01,840
but this is uh the from a deep learning
 

1273
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,110
but this is uh the from a deep learning
point of view, there's an asymmetry, and

1274
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
point of view, there's an asymmetry, and
 

1275
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,149
point of view, there's an asymmetry, and
it kind of makes sense for there to be

1276
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:04,159
it kind of makes sense for there to be
 

1277
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,549
it kind of makes sense for there to be
asymmetry.

1278
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:06,559
asymmetry.
 

1279
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,950
asymmetry.
So from our point of view though as in

1280
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:08,960
So from our point of view though as in
 

1281
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,149
So from our point of view though as in
deep learning we have a practical

1282
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:10,159
deep learning we have a practical
 

1283
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,990
deep learning we have a practical
problem which is we have to choose which

1284
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
problem which is we have to choose which
 

1285
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,830
problem which is we have to choose which
one is the desired distribution and

1286
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:13,840
one is the desired distribution and
 

1287
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,310
one is the desired distribution and
which one is the one that we're trying

1288
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,320
which one is the one that we're trying
 

1289
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,669
which one is the one that we're trying
to make look like the desired

1290
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
to make look like the desired
 

1291
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,029
to make look like the desired
distribution. And so the choice we do is

1292
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:21,039
distribution. And so the choice we do is
 

1293
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,789
distribution. And so the choice we do is
we put the desired distribution in the P

1294
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:22,799
we put the desired distribution in the P
 

1295
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,710
we put the desired distribution in the P
spot.

1296
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,720
spot.
 

1297
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,909
spot.
And the reason we put the desired

1298
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:25,919
And the reason we put the desired
 

1299
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,990
And the reason we put the desired
distribution in the P spot is that

1300
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,000
distribution in the P spot is that
 

1301
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,510
distribution in the P spot is that
we don't want we want a high loss on Q

1302
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:33,520
we don't want we want a high loss on Q
 

1303
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,590
we don't want we want a high loss on Q
generating things that look very

1304
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:35,600
generating things that look very
 

1305
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,430
generating things that look very
unlikely under P.

1306
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:39,440
unlikely under P.
 

1307
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,070
unlikely under P.
Okay? Because we want it when we use it,

1308
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
Okay? Because we want it when we use it,
 

1309
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,389
Okay? Because we want it when we use it,
we're going to use P and we want to have

1310
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:44,399
we're going to use P and we want to have
 

1311
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,430
we're going to use P and we want to have
seen things like P

1312
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
seen things like P
 

1313
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,190
seen things like P
during training. Everyone see that? Like

1314
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,200
during training. Everyone see that? Like
 

1315
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,789
during training. Everyone see that? Like
that's important to us. So we put the

1316
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:54,799
that's important to us. So we put the
 

1317
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,070
that's important to us. So we put the
desired thing in P and we have Q be uh

1318
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,080
desired thing in P and we have Q be uh
 

1319
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:07,990
desired thing in P and we have Q be uh
that distribution the one up on top.

1320
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000

 

1321
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,149

Okay. So now we have to choose a

1322
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:10,159
Okay. So now we have to choose a
 

1323
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,909
Okay. So now we have to choose a
distribution.

1324
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:11,919
distribution.
 

1325
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,630
distribution.
So we we picked a loss a default loss.

1326
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
So we we picked a loss a default loss.
 

1327
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,750
So we we picked a loss a default loss.
People use others. I just want to start

1328
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:15,760
People use others. I just want to start
 

1329
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,230
People use others. I just want to start
with one. Um so

1330
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,240
with one. Um so
 

1331
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,590
with one. Um so
what's a good choice? So in generally

1332
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
what's a good choice? So in generally
 

1333
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,830
what's a good choice? So in generally
for continuous distributions, we have

1334
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:25,840
for continuous distributions, we have
 

1335
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,789
for continuous distributions, we have
two go-to choices that we like. We like

1336
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:28,799
two go-to choices that we like. We like
 

1337
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,750
two go-to choices that we like. We like
uniforms and we like Gaussians. You've

1338
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:31,760
uniforms and we like Gaussians. You've
 

1339
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,029
uniforms and we like Gaussians. You've
seen this before. And only after those

1340
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:35,039
seen this before. And only after those
 

1341
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,870
seen this before. And only after those
two don't work practically do we say

1342
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:36,880
two don't work practically do we say
 

1343
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,029
two don't work practically do we say
maybe I'll try an exponential, right?

1344
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
maybe I'll try an exponential, right?
 

1345
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,470
maybe I'll try an exponential, right?
And if the exponential doesn't work,

1346
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:40,480
And if the exponential doesn't work,
 

1347
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,230
And if the exponential doesn't work,
you'll like go beyond that. But you kind

1348
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240
you'll like go beyond that. But you kind
 

1349
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,149
you'll like go beyond that. But you kind
of like to sit with these two if you

1350
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:44,159
of like to sit with these two if you
 

1351
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,470
of like to sit with these two if you
can.

1352
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
can.
 

1353
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,230
can.
Uh so we make a choice. And a pragmatic

1354
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,240
Uh so we make a choice. And a pragmatic
 

1355
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,029
Uh so we make a choice. And a pragmatic
way to make the choice is to say for

1356
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,039
way to make the choice is to say for
 

1357
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,509
way to make the choice is to say for
what do we have nice formulas for KL

1358
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:55,519
what do we have nice formulas for KL
 

1359
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,590
what do we have nice formulas for KL
divergence.

1360
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
divergence.
 

1361
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,509
divergence.
Okay, Gaussians are really nice because

1362
00:31:59,509 --> 00:31:59,519
Okay, Gaussians are really nice because
 

1363
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,350
Okay, Gaussians are really nice because
you can have you have very nice formulas

1364
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,360
you can have you have very nice formulas
 

1365
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,029
you can have you have very nice formulas
uh for KL divergence. So you say great

1366
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,039
uh for KL divergence. So you say great
 

1367
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,750
uh for KL divergence. So you say great
I'll choose a Gaussian and what Gaussian

1368
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:07,760
I'll choose a Gaussian and what Gaussian
 

1369
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,669
I'll choose a Gaussian and what Gaussian
should I choose? Well the easiest

1370
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
should I choose? Well the easiest
 

1371
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,230
should I choose? Well the easiest
Gaussian is just isotropic.

1372
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:12,240
Gaussian is just isotropic.
 

1373
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,190
Gaussian is just isotropic.
Okay so I have a zero mean and it has an

1374
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
Okay so I have a zero mean and it has an
 

1375
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,789
Okay so I have a zero mean and it has an
identity coariance. So a bunch of ID

1376
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:16,799
identity coariance. So a bunch of ID
 

1377
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,630
identity coariance. So a bunch of ID
gaussians easy to sample from. I'll use

1378
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:18,640
gaussians easy to sample from. I'll use
 

1379
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,029
gaussians easy to sample from. I'll use
that.

1380
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:21,039
that.
 

1381
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,269
that.
So, what's great about that is that you

1382
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:23,279
So, what's great about that is that you
 

1383
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,909
So, what's great about that is that you
can just look and see that there are

1384
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:25,919
can just look and see that there are
 

1385
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,430
can just look and see that there are
formulas

1386
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:27,440
formulas
 

1387
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,509
formulas
that will tell you if you have uh

1388
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:31,519
that will tell you if you have uh
 

1389
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,070
that will tell you if you have uh
Gaussian on this side and a Gaussian on

1390
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
Gaussian on this side and a Gaussian on
 

1391
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,669
Gaussian on this side and a Gaussian on
this side, what's the divergence between

1392
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:37,679
this side, what's the divergence between
 

1393
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,830
this side, what's the divergence between
them? So specifically for the case of

1394
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:41,840
them? So specifically for the case of
 

1395
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,750
them? So specifically for the case of
the uh identity uh coariance on that

1396
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:45,760
the uh identity uh coariance on that
 

1397
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,990
the uh identity uh coariance on that
side and a generic mean and a generic uh

1398
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,000
side and a generic mean and a generic uh
 

1399
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,470
side and a generic mean and a generic uh
coariance matrix you have this nice

1400
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:52,480
coariance matrix you have this nice
 

1401
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,909
coariance matrix you have this nice
formula. So you take half the trace of

1402
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
formula. So you take half the trace of
 

1403
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,350
formula. So you take half the trace of
the coariance of Q. You take the inner

1404
00:32:59,350 --> 00:32:59,360
the coariance of Q. You take the inner
 

1405
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,029
the coariance of Q. You take the inner
product the the the two norm squared of

1406
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:03,039
product the the the two norm squared of
 

1407
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,230
product the the the two norm squared of
the mean. You subtract K and you

1408
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,240
the mean. You subtract K and you
 

1409
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,509
the mean. You subtract K and you
subtract the log determinant of this.

1410
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
subtract the log determinant of this.
 

1411
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,430
subtract the log determinant of this.
So again if you think about it

1412
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:13,440
So again if you think about it
 

1413
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,830
So again if you think about it
you know if the two distributions are

1414
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:15,840
you know if the two distributions are
 

1415
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,190
you know if the two distributions are
equal if this is zero

1416
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
equal if this is zero
 

1417
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,630
equal if this is zero
right then this will all zero out. Okay,

1418
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:22,640
right then this will all zero out. Okay,
 

1419
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,909
right then this will all zero out. Okay,
you can do that as an exercise to see

1420
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:23,919
you can do that as an exercise to see
 

1421
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,590
you can do that as an exercise to see
that it all it all zeros out.

1422
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
that it all it all zeros out.
 

1423
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,549
that it all it all zeros out.
The only important thing here is that

1424
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:30,559
The only important thing here is that
 

1425
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,909
The only important thing here is that
this is something which you can compute.

1426
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:33,919
this is something which you can compute.
 

1427
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,110
this is something which you can compute.
Okay, this is this is computable.

1428
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,120

 

1429
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,789

So now you have a formula you could use

1430
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:42,799
So now you have a formula you could use
 

1431
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,509
So now you have a formula you could use
for a loss.

1432
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519
for a loss.
 

1433
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,190
for a loss.
And now the question is can I make a

1434
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200
And now the question is can I make a
 

1435
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,710
And now the question is can I make a
neural net such that this distribution I

1436
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
neural net such that this distribution I
 

1437
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,389
neural net such that this distribution I
have here

1438
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:54,399
have here
 

1439
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,909
have here
is this. So I'll parameterize it by two

1440
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:57,919
is this. So I'll parameterize it by two
 

1441
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,269
is this. So I'll parameterize it by two
things the mean and the coariance

1442
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:01,279
things the mean and the coariance
 

1443
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,230
things the mean and the coariance
matrix.

1444
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,240
matrix.
 

1445
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,190
matrix.
So I've partially drawn the uh the

1446
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,200
So I've partially drawn the uh the
 

1447
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,190
So I've partially drawn the uh the
answer.

1448
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
answer.
 

1449
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,990
answer.
So you can definitely have something

1450
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
So you can definitely have something
 

1451
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,349
So you can definitely have something
emit the mean,

1452
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:15,359
emit the mean,
 

1453
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,230
emit the mean,
right? This is the vector.

1454
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,240
right? This is the vector.
 

1455
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,030
right? This is the vector.
How do I get it to emit a coariance

1456
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,040
How do I get it to emit a coariance
 

1457
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,710
How do I get it to emit a coariance
matrix is the question?

1458
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:24,720
matrix is the question?
 

1459
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,349
matrix is the question?
Everyone see why this is a question. So

1460
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:27,359
Everyone see why this is a question. So
 

1461
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,829
Everyone see why this is a question. So
can someone tell me why is it why can't

1462
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:29,839
can someone tell me why is it why can't
 

1463
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,669
can someone tell me why is it why can't
I just draw something out of here just

1464
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:31,679
I just draw something out of here just
 

1465
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,790
I just draw something out of here just
naturally that says

1466
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:34,800
naturally that says
 

1467
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,109
naturally that says
I'll try something

1468
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:39,119

 

1469
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:53,270

Why can't I just do this

1470
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:53,280

 

1471
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,230

like just fine the coariance matrix is a

1472
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
like just fine the coariance matrix is a
 

1473
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,829
like just fine the coariance matrix is a
matrix

1474
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:57,839
matrix
 

1475
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,430
matrix
so just have the neural net here emit a

1476
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,440
so just have the neural net here emit a
 

1477
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,270
so just have the neural net here emit a
matrix I could structure that matrix in

1478
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,280
matrix I could structure that matrix in
 

1479
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,870
matrix I could structure that matrix in
some form but that's all okay why can't

1480
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:04,880
some form but that's all okay why can't
 

1481
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,190
some form but that's all okay why can't
I just have it emit emit a matrix

1482
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,200
I just have it emit emit a matrix
 

1483
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,150
I just have it emit emit a matrix
Yeah.

1484
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,160
Yeah.
 

1485
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,990
Yeah.

1499
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,349
you know cons in it has attention in it
has lots all the neural net stuff is in

1500

has lots all the neural net stuff is in
 

1501
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,750
has lots all the neural net stuff is in

here. It's going to emit vector type
 

1503
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,150
here. It's going to emit vector type
stuff. Vectors go in, vectors come out.

stuff. Vectors go in, vectors come out.
 

1505
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,310
stuff. Vectors go in, vectors come out.
That's not a problem. You can think of a

1506
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,320
That's not a problem. You can think of a
 

1507
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,950
That's not a problem. You can think of a
matrix as a whole collection of vectors.

1508
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:38,960
matrix as a whole collection of vectors.
 

1509

That's all that's not that's not an

That's all that's not that's not an
 

1511
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,150
That's all that's not that's not an
issue. The question is I want this to be

1512
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,160
issue. The question is I want this to be
 

1513
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,270
issue. The question is I want this to be
a coariance.

1514
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,280
a coariance.
 

1515
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,109
a coariance.
So anyone can point out like what what

1516
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:49,119
So anyone can point out like what what
 

1517
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,150
So anyone can point out like what what
might be a challenge here.

1518
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,160
might be a challenge here.
 

1519
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,430

>> Yeah. Here

>> Yeah. Here
 

1521
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,589
>> Yeah. Here
>> like coariances are like

1522
00:35:59,589 --> 00:35:59,599

 

1523
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,270

so it's like you have some properties

1524
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,280
so it's like you have some properties
 

1525
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,829
so it's like you have some properties
that

1526
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:03,839
that
 

1527
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,109
that

1529
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,270

the important thing is a coariance isn't

1530
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
the important thing is a coariance isn't
 

1531
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,630
the important thing is a coariance isn't
just any matrix. A coar a coariance for

1532
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:10,640
just any matrix. A coar a coariance for
 

1533
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,349
just any matrix. A coar a coariance for
a Gaussian is a symmetric positive

1534
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:13,359
a Gaussian is a symmetric positive
 

1535
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,829
a Gaussian is a symmetric positive
definite or in this case I'm positive

1536
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:15,839
definite or in this case I'm positive
 

1537
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,190
definite or in this case I'm positive
semi-definite matrix. I'm fine with

1538
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,200
semi-definite matrix. I'm fine with
 

1539
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,870
semi-definite matrix. I'm fine with
semi-definite

1540
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:18,880
semi-definite
 

1541
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,030
semi-definite
although that will like make this blow

1542
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
although that will like make this blow
 

1543
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,870
although that will like make this blow
up which is fine but the loss will do

1544
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:22,880
up which is fine but the loss will do
 

1545
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,910
up which is fine but the loss will do
that. Um so does everyone see I need to

1546
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:25,920
that. Um so does everyone see I need to
 

1547
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,510
that. Um so does everyone see I need to
have it be positive semi-definite. If I

1548
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:27,520
have it be positive semi-definite. If I
 

1549
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,910
have it be positive semi-definite. If I
just emit a random set of a random

1550
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
just emit a random set of a random
 

1551
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,270
just emit a random set of a random
matrix, it will not be positive

1552
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,280
matrix, it will not be positive
 

1553
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,109
matrix, it will not be positive
semi-definite. It'll just fail being the

1554
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:33,119
semi-definite. It'll just fail being the
 

1555
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,950
semi-definite. It'll just fail being the
wrong type.

1556
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:34,960
wrong type.
 

1557
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,710
wrong type.
So I can't quite do that. Okay, so that

1558
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:38,720
So I can't quite do that. Okay, so that
 

1559
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,069
So I can't quite do that. Okay, so that
doesn't quite work. So let me go in here

1560
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:42,079
doesn't quite work. So let me go in here
 

1561
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,470
doesn't quite work. So let me go in here
and erase this.

1562
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:46,480

 

1563
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,670

So now the question is

1564
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:49,680
So now the question is
 

1565
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,630
So now the question is
symmetry I can always get. That's not a

1566
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:52,640
symmetry I can always get. That's not a
 

1567
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,390
symmetry I can always get. That's not a
problem by itself. So I'm not worried

1568
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:54,400
problem by itself. So I'm not worried
 

1569
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,910
problem by itself. So I'm not worried
about the symmetry. How do I get it to

1570
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:55,920
about the symmetry. How do I get it to
 

1571
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,510
about the symmetry. How do I get it to
be? How can I emit something such that I

1572
00:36:59,510 --> 00:36:59,520
be? How can I emit something such that I
 

1573
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,430
be? How can I emit something such that I
can parameterize

1574
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:01,440
can parameterize
 

1575
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,470
can parameterize
positive semidefinite matrices somehow?

1576
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:06,480
positive semidefinite matrices somehow?
 

1577
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,270
positive semidefinite matrices somehow?
>> Yeah.

1578
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,280
>> Yeah.
 

1579
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,710
>> Yeah.
>> Take a matrix and multiply with a

1580
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:08,720
>> Take a matrix and multiply with a
 

1581
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,829
>> Take a matrix and multiply with a
transpose.

1582
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
transpose.
 

1583
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,750
transpose.
>> Yeah.

1584
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:11,760
>> Yeah.
 

1585
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,550
>> Yeah.
>> PSD,

1586
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,560
>> PSD,
 

1587
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,710
>> PSD,
>> right? If I take a matrix and I multiply

1588
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,720
>> right? If I take a matrix and I multiply
 

1589
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,230
>> right? If I take a matrix and I multiply
it by its transpose, I'm going to get

1590
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,240
it by its transpose, I'm going to get
 

1591
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,470
it by its transpose, I'm going to get
something that's PSD.

1592
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:18,480
something that's PSD.
 

1593
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,630
something that's PSD.
So I can just say the output of the

1594
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
So I can just say the output of the
 

1595
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,589
So I can just say the output of the
encoder isn't

1596
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:23,599
encoder isn't
 

1597
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,750
encoder isn't
the coariance matrix but the square root

1598
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:25,760
the coariance matrix but the square root
 

1599
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,150
the coariance matrix but the square root
of the coariance matrix.

1600
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160

 

1601
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,030

No. So that way the coarian matrix

1602
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,040
No. So that way the coarian matrix
 

1603
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,510
No. So that way the coarian matrix
itself is going to be

1604
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,520
itself is going to be
 

1605
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,630
itself is going to be
the square root

1606
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:40,640
the square root
 

1607
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,390
the square root
times

1608
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:42,400
times
 

1609
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,589
times
its transpose.

1610
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:47,599

 

1611
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,670

Now I'm guaranteed that when I want the

1612
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:49,680
Now I'm guaranteed that when I want the
 

1613
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,349
Now I'm guaranteed that when I want the
coariance, I parameterized it this way

1614
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:51,359
coariance, I parameterized it this way
 

1615
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,550
coariance, I parameterized it this way
and I'm going to get something that's

1616
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:52,560
and I'm going to get something that's
 

1617
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,710
and I'm going to get something that's
going to be uh PSD.

1618
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:56,720

 

1619
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,870

Wonderful. So now I have something which

1620
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:00,880
Wonderful. So now I have something which
 

1621
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,349
Wonderful. So now I have something which
will work with the loss.

1622
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,359
will work with the loss.
 

1623
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,030
will work with the loss.
So instead of take I'll take the log

1624
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,040
So instead of take I'll take the log
 

1625
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,470
So instead of take I'll take the log
debt of this thing over here. I'll take

1626
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,480
debt of this thing over here. I'll take
 

1627
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,030
debt of this thing over here. I'll take
the trace of this thing. All fine. I can

1628
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,040
the trace of this thing. All fine. I can
 

1629
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,950
the trace of this thing. All fine. I can
pass gradients through that. it will

1630
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:14,960
pass gradients through that. it will
 

1631
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,829
pass gradients through that. it will
work

1632
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:17,839
work
 

1633
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,870
work
and if I want to have any structure uh

1634
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
and if I want to have any structure uh
 

1635
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,790
and if I want to have any structure uh
to the coariance that's practical for

1636
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:22,800
to the coariance that's practical for
 

1637
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,750
to the coariance that's practical for
the problem I can also do that right

1638
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:25,760
the problem I can also do that right
 

1639
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,390
the problem I can also do that right
it's it's

1640
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:28,400
it's it's
 

1641
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,829
it's it's
this is a very generic transformation if

1642
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:29,839
this is a very generic transformation if
 

1643
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:30,950
this is a very generic transformation if
I want some other additional structure I

1644
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
I want some other additional structure I
 

1645
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,310
I want some other additional structure I
can impose it it's not a problem

1646
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:34,320
can impose it it's not a problem
 

1647
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,910
can impose it it's not a problem
okay so now I have uh a way of

1648
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:41,920
okay so now I have uh a way of
 

1649
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,230
okay so now I have uh a way of
parameterizing the output so I can do

1650
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:44,240
parameterizing the output so I can do
 

1651
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,190
parameterizing the output so I can do
this now I can tell if you tell me I

1652
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:47,200
this now I can tell if you tell me I
 

1653
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,390
this now I can tell if you tell me I
have a mean and a coariance I can make a

1654
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,400
have a mean and a coariance I can make a
 

1655
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,829
have a mean and a coariance I can make a
sampler for this

1656
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839
sampler for this
 

1657
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,589
sampler for this
so the question is how am I going to

1658
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:55,599
so the question is how am I going to
 

1659
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,230
so the question is how am I going to
make the sampler for this that's going

1660
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:58,240
make the sampler for this that's going
 

1661
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,069
make the sampler for this that's going
to help me satisfy the constraint I have

1662
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:02,079
to help me satisfy the constraint I have
 

1663
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,829
to help me satisfy the constraint I have
that when I'm eventually going to run

1664
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
that when I'm eventually going to run
 

1665
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,510
that when I'm eventually going to run
back prop the loss from here

1666
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,520
back prop the loss from here
 

1667
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,589
back prop the loss from here
right will back prop through the decoder

1668
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:09,599
right will back prop through the decoder
 

1669
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,150
right will back prop through the decoder
fine but I have to run it through the

1670
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,160
fine but I have to run it through the
 

1671
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,230
fine but I have to run it through the
sampler somehow

1672
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,240
sampler somehow
 

1673
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,109
sampler somehow
and come back and hit the encoder.

1674
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:17,119
and come back and hit the encoder.
 

1675
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,750
and come back and hit the encoder.
So how can I make my sampler which uses

1676
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:19,760
So how can I make my sampler which uses
 

1677
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,990
So how can I make my sampler which uses
randomness the square root of the

1678
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,000
randomness the square root of the
 

1679
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,790
randomness the square root of the
coariance and the mean to have something

1680
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:24,800
coariance and the mean to have something
 

1681
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,349
coariance and the mean to have something
through which gradients will flow?

1682
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:27,359
through which gradients will flow?
 

1683
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,790
through which gradients will flow?
That's the next question.

1684
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:32,800

 

1685
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,790

Okay. So let's just uh put in what we

1686
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:34,800
Okay. So let's just uh put in what we
 

1687
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:49,109
Okay. So let's just uh put in what we
have.

1688
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:49,119

 

1689
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,349

So here's the thing, right? I know how

1690
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:53,359
So here's the thing, right? I know how
 

1691
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,910
So here's the thing, right? I know how
to do the mean part.

1692
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:55,920
to do the mean part.
 

1693
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,310
to do the mean part.
I can sample from a Gaussian which has a

1694
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:58,320
I can sample from a Gaussian which has a
 

1695
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,190
I can sample from a Gaussian which has a
mean and a coariance by adding the mean

1696
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
mean and a coariance by adding the mean
 

1697
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,270
mean and a coariance by adding the mean
to a Gaussian that has the coariance I

1698
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:03,280
to a Gaussian that has the coariance I
 

1699
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,829
to a Gaussian that has the coariance I
want. Everyone good with that? So this

1700
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:05,839
want. Everyone good with that? So this
 

1701
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,790
want. Everyone good with that? So this
part I got.

1702
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:08,800
part I got.
 

1703
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,550
part I got.
Now the question is how do I get a

1704
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
Now the question is how do I get a
 

1705
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,670
Now the question is how do I get a
Gaussian with mean zero and a desired

1706
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:15,680
Gaussian with mean zero and a desired
 

1707
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,430
Gaussian with mean zero and a desired
coariance.

1708
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,440
coariance.
 

1709
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,910
coariance.
You know I have to draw something. I

1710
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:19,920
You know I have to draw something. I
 

1711
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,510
You know I have to draw something. I
have to draw something. I can draw kind

1712
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:21,520
have to draw something. I can draw kind
 

1713
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,670
have to draw something. I can draw kind
of computationally easily. I can't say

1714
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:23,680
of computationally easily. I can't say
 

1715
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,390
of computationally easily. I can't say
my generic object is draw from this

1716
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
my generic object is draw from this
 

1717
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,109
my generic object is draw from this
coariance. That's the whole problem,

1718
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:29,119
coariance. That's the whole problem,
 

1719
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,550
coariance. That's the whole problem,
right? So I have to draw from something

1720
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:30,560
right? So I have to draw from something
 

1721
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,589
right? So I have to draw from something
that I know. So let's just make it easy.

1722
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:33,599
that I know. So let's just make it easy.
 

1723
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,550
that I know. So let's just make it easy.
I know that all jointly normal things

1724
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,560
I know that all jointly normal things
 

1725
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,910
I know that all jointly normal things
are linear functions of a standard iid

1726
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:41,920
are linear functions of a standard iid
 

1727
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,510
are linear functions of a standard iid
normal

1728
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:43,520
normal
 

1729
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,829
normal
right so let's try to exploit that so

1730
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:45,839
right so let's try to exploit that so
 

1731
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,589
right so let's try to exploit that so
I'll tell you that my input here

1732
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:51,599

 

1733

So now I have this as my ingredient. I

1742
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,160
So now I have this as my ingredient. I
 

1743
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,750
So now I have this as my ingredient. I
know that any Gaussian I want

1744
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:09,760
know that any Gaussian I want
 

1745
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,550
know that any Gaussian I want
that's zero mean is a linear function of

1746
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:14,560
that's zero mean is a linear function of
 

1747
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,270
that's zero mean is a linear function of
this guy in this dimension. I have the

1752
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:22,480
What do I do
 

1753
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:33,270
What do I do
to get what I want?

1754
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,280

 

1755
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,829

How do I do and remember? So let's just

1756
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:35,839
How do I do and remember? So let's just
 

1757
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,910
How do I do and remember? So let's just
start with the basic suppose a scalar

1758
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:37,920
start with the basic suppose a scalar
 

1759
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,150
start with the basic suppose a scalar
and I want to have a Gaussian with

1763
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,829
square root of coariance of standard

1764
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:43,839

1765
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,190

I want something with standard deviation

1766
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,200
I want something with standard deviation
 

1767
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,430
I want something with standard deviation

1768
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,440
is 10. What do I do?
 

1769
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,589
is 10. What do I do?
Someone

1770
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:53,599

 

1771
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,390

>> multiply

1772
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:54,400
>> multiply
 

1773
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,829
>> multiply
>> multiply it right multiply 10. Okay. Now

1774
00:41:57,829 --> 00:41:57,839
>> multiply it right multiply 10. Okay. Now
 

1775
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,109
>> multiply it right multiply 10. Okay. Now
what's the answer here?

1776
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:01,119
what's the answer here?
 

1777
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:08,309
what's the answer here?
>> Multiply. Yes.

1778
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:08,319

 

1779
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,510

Okay. This is vector matrix

1780
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:09,520
Okay. This is vector matrix
 

1781
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,430
Okay. This is vector matrix
multiplication.

1782
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:11,440
multiplication.
 

1783
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,990
multiplication.
Right. Vector matrix multiplication

1784
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,000
Right. Vector matrix multiplication
 

1785
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,910
Right. Vector matrix multiplication
of the square root with this will give

1786
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:15,920
of the square root with this will give
 

1787
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,750
of the square root with this will give
me a Gaussian that has the coariance.

1788
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:17,760
me a Gaussian that has the coariance.
 

1789
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,390
me a Gaussian that has the coariance.
Okay. Again basic property of uh

1790
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:20,400
Okay. Again basic property of uh
 

1791
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,150
Okay. Again basic property of uh
multivariate gaussians.

1792
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,160

 

1793
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,150

So

1794
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,160
So
 

1795
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,829
So
this is nice right? So I have uh

1796
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:29,839
this is nice right? So I have uh
 

1797
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,550
this is nice right? So I have uh
something that uh I have a way of

1798
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:32,560
something that uh I have a way of
 

1799
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,230
something that uh I have a way of
sampling. Now let's think about what

1800
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,240
sampling. Now let's think about what
 

1801
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,550
sampling. Now let's think about what
happens to gradients.

1802
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:40,560

 

1803
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:48,630

Oops. Use a different color.

1804
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:48,640

 

1805
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,510

Okay. So, back prop goes happily through

1806
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:51,520
Okay. So, back prop goes happily through
 

1807
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,390
Okay. So, back prop goes happily through
here. No problem.

1808
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:56,400

 

1809
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,030

Back prop goes happily

1810
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,040

 

1811
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,670

through here. No problem everyone.

1812
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:05,680
through here. No problem everyone.
 

1813
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,750
through here. No problem everyone.
That's all. Not a problem. So now it

1814
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:07,760
That's all. Not a problem. So now it
 

1815
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,230
That's all. Not a problem. So now it
encounters this plus. What does backrop

1816
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,240
encounters this plus. What does backrop
 

1817
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,870
encounters this plus. What does backrop
do on a plus?

1818
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:12,880
do on a plus?
 

1819
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,910
do on a plus?
Just splits. goes in both directions. So

1820
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:15,920
Just splits. goes in both directions. So
 

1821
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,390
Just splits. goes in both directions. So
it happily continues straight through

1822
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:20,400
it happily continues straight through
 

1823
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,230
it happily continues straight through
along the mean and it also comes

1824
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,240
along the mean and it also comes
 

1825
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,109
along the mean and it also comes
through out here through this multiply.

1826
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:29,119
through out here through this multiply.
 

1827
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,230
through out here through this multiply.
The multiply will also split it in two

1828
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240
The multiply will also split it in two
 

1829
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,589
The multiply will also split it in two
directions, right? Differently but split

1830
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:35,599
directions, right? Differently but split
 

1831
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,270
directions, right? Differently but split
in two directions. And so it'll happily

1832
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:37,280
in two directions. And so it'll happily
 

1833
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,870
in two directions. And so it'll happily
flow

1834
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:38,880
flow
 

1835
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,270
flow
out this way

1836
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
out this way
 

1837
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,990
out this way
into the square root of the coariance

1838
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,000
into the square root of the coariance
 

1839
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,950
into the square root of the coariance
and it'll flow in principle onto

1840
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:48,960
and it'll flow in principle onto
 

1841
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,430
and it'll flow in principle onto
the noise just like the gradient in

1842
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:51,440
the noise just like the gradient in
 

1843
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,069
the noise just like the gradient in
principle will flow onto the data back

1844
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:54,079
principle will flow onto the data back
 

1845
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,950
principle will flow onto the data back
here. Everyone good with that?

1846
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:58,960
here. Everyone good with that?
 

1847
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,550
here. Everyone good with that?
So important point is gradients make it

1848
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:02,560
So important point is gradients make it
 

1849
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:11,510
So important point is gradients make it
all the way through

1850
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:11,520

 

1851
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,510

the encoder.

1852
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:15,520

 

1853
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,829

So now you might wonder, wait a minute,

1854
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:19,839
So now you might wonder, wait a minute,
 

1855
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,109
So now you might wonder, wait a minute,
I have this random V that I sampled.

1856
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:25,119
I have this random V that I sampled.
 

1857
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,870
I have this random V that I sampled.
So in principle, I have a gradient going

1858
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
So in principle, I have a gradient going
 

1859
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,829
So in principle, I have a gradient going
towards this V, but I don't do anything

1860
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:29,839
towards this V, but I don't do anything
 

1861
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,750
towards this V, but I don't do anything
with it.

1862
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:31,760
with it.
 

1863
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,069
with it.
So how am I thinking about it? The way

1864
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:34,079
So how am I thinking about it? The way
 

1865
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,990
So how am I thinking about it? The way
I'm thinking about it is I'm thinking

1866
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm thinking about it is I'm thinking
 

1867
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,710
I'm thinking about it is I'm thinking
about the V as having the same status as

1868
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:38,720
about the V as having the same status as
 

1869
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,589
about the V as having the same status as
the X, the input.

1870
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:41,599
the X, the input.
 

1871
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,069
the X, the input.
It's just another part of the data.

1872
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:46,079

 

1873
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,950

Okay, so the idea is that for stochastic

1874
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
Okay, so the idea is that for stochastic
 

1875
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,630
Okay, so the idea is that for stochastic
gradient descent and stochastic type

1876
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:50,640
gradient descent and stochastic type
 

1877
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,750
gradient descent and stochastic type
approaches, what I know is that the

1878
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:53,760
approaches, what I know is that the
 

1879
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,550
approaches, what I know is that the
expectations that I take will be like

1880
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:56,560
expectations that I take will be like
 

1881
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,190
expectations that I take will be like
the true gradients. So the expectation

1882
00:44:59,190 --> 00:44:59,200
the true gradients. So the expectation
 

1883
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,430
the true gradients. So the expectation
of the gradient going here will see the

1884
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:01,440
of the gradient going here will see the
 

1885
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,430
of the gradient going here will see the
average effect of all these V's.

1886
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:03,440
average effect of all these V's.
 

1887
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,950
average effect of all these V's.
Remember this matrix multiply will have

1888
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:04,960
Remember this matrix multiply will have
 

1889
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,430
Remember this matrix multiply will have
the V's coming into the gradient,

1890
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:07,440
the V's coming into the gradient,
 

1891
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,750
the V's coming into the gradient,
right? And that will be the gradient I

1892
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:09,760
right? And that will be the gradient I
 

1893
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,589
right? And that will be the gradient I
want.

1894
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:11,599
want.
 

1895
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,510
want.
And that's all I need for SGD type

1896
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:13,520
And that's all I need for SGD type
 

1897
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,510
And that's all I need for SGD type
things to work. Okay, so the fact that

1898
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
things to work. Okay, so the fact that
 

1899
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,270
things to work. Okay, so the fact that
I'm doing SGD and I'm already kind of

1900
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:19,280
I'm doing SGD and I'm already kind of
 

1901
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,190
I'm doing SGD and I'm already kind of
happy using SGD means I'm happy doing

1902
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,200
happy using SGD means I'm happy doing
 

1903
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,230
happy using SGD means I'm happy doing
this. And now I have a way of taking a

1904
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:24,240
this. And now I have a way of taking a
 

1905
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,829
this. And now I have a way of taking a
gradient through sampling. Now you saw

1906
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:25,839
gradient through sampling. Now you saw
 

1907
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,550
gradient through sampling. Now you saw
this idea in your homework also where

1908
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560
this idea in your homework also where
 

1909
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,390
this idea in your homework also where
you talked about doing optimizations

1910
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:30,400
you talked about doing optimizations
 

1911
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,670
you talked about doing optimizations
over functions that are not

1912
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,680
over functions that are not
 

1913
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,510
over functions that are not
differentiable.

1914
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:33,520
differentiable.
 

1915
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,470
differentiable.
Okay, so now you have all the

1916
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
Okay, so now you have all the
 

1917
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,349
Okay, so now you have all the
ingredients you need to train a VAE.

1918
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:41,359
ingredients you need to train a VAE.
 

1919
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,150
ingredients you need to train a VAE.
So to summarize, you set up a

1920
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:46,160
So to summarize, you set up a
 

1921
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,349
So to summarize, you set up a
distribution that you're going to draw

1922
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:47,359
distribution that you're going to draw
 

1923
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,550
distribution that you're going to draw
from. Standard choice is Gaussian.

1924
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:50,560
from. Standard choice is Gaussian.
 

1925
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,230
from. Standard choice is Gaussian.
And you say, I would like to have this

1926
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,240
And you say, I would like to have this
 

1927
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,230
And you say, I would like to have this
resulting distribution look like normal

1928
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:56,240
resulting distribution look like normal
 

1929
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,710
resulting distribution look like normal
01. Normal iid normal01.

1930
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,720
01. Normal iid normal01.
 

1931
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,589
01. Normal iid normal01.
But there's a tension now, okay, in

1932
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:03,599
But there's a tension now, okay, in
 

1933
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,510
But there's a tension now, okay, in
between these two losses. These two

1934
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:05,520
between these two losses. These two
 

1935
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,510
between these two losses. These two
losses are not synergistic to each

1936
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:07,520
losses are not synergistic to each
 

1937
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,829
losses are not synergistic to each
other. They're in tension. Why are they

1938
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:09,839
other. They're in tension. Why are they
 

1939
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,430
other. They're in tension. Why are they
in tension?

1940
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:11,440
in tension?
 

1941
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,150
in tension?
because this loss wants your

1942
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:14,160
because this loss wants your
 

1943
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,069
because this loss wants your
reconstruction to be perfect.

1944
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
reconstruction to be perfect.
 

1945
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,630
reconstruction to be perfect.
Okay, for the reconstruction to be

1946
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:20,640
Okay, for the reconstruction to be
 

1947
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,710
Okay, for the reconstruction to be
perfect,

1948
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:22,720
perfect,
 

1949
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,990
perfect,
there has to be a lot of particularities

1950
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,000
there has to be a lot of particularities
 

1951
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,990
there has to be a lot of particularities
of X that are communicated through this

1952
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,000
of X that are communicated through this
 

1953
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,150
of X that are communicated through this
mean and through the and whatever this

1954
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,160
mean and through the and whatever this
 

1955
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,030
mean and through the and whatever this
distribution of Z is.

1956
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040

 

1957
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,990

This loss wants this to be zero

1958
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,000
This loss wants this to be zero
 

1959
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,589
This loss wants this to be zero
and this to be the identity

1960
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
and this to be the identity
 

1961
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,430
and this to be the identity
always.

1962
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:45,440
always.
 

1963
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,190
always.
In fact, this loss will wants this to

1964
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,200
In fact, this loss will wants this to
 

1965
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,550
In fact, this loss will wants this to
have no variation at all. Clearly, these

1966
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:50,560
have no variation at all. Clearly, these
 

1967
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,710
have no variation at all. Clearly, these
cannot both be satisfied at the same

1968
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:52,720
cannot both be satisfied at the same
 

1969
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,829
cannot both be satisfied at the same
time. Does everyone see that? If I make

1970
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:55,839
time. Does everyone see that? If I make
 

1971
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:00,790
time. Does everyone see that? If I make
this loss have more importance,

1972
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:00,800
this loss have more importance,
 

1973
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,430
this loss have more importance,
this loss is going to get worse. If I

1974
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:03,440
this loss is going to get worse. If I
 

1975
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,829
this loss is going to get worse. If I
make this loss have more importance,

1976
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:05,839
make this loss have more importance,
 

1977
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,510
make this loss have more importance,
this loss is going to get worse. There's

1978
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:07,520
this loss is going to get worse. There's
 

1979
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,630
this loss is going to get worse. There's
a trade-off between these two losses.

1980
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:10,640
a trade-off between these two losses.
 

1981
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:26,950
a trade-off between these two losses.
Okay, so note.

1982
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:26,960

 

1983
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,470

That means there's a hyperparameter you

1984
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:28,480
That means there's a hyperparameter you
 

1985
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,470
That means there's a hyperparameter you
have to set which is what's the balance

1986
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
have to set which is what's the balance
 

1987
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:45,670
have to set which is what's the balance
between them.

1988
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680

 

1989
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,870

Okay, so you set some amount some you

1990
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:48,880
Okay, so you set some amount some you
 

1991
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,630
Okay, so you set some amount some you
can think about multiplying this loss by

1992
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640
can think about multiplying this loss by
 

1993
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,470
can think about multiplying this loss by
some constant

1994
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:52,480
some constant
 

1995
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,109
some constant
as an example and then when the

1996
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:55,119
as an example and then when the
 

1997
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,190
as an example and then when the
gradients come back these two different

1998
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,200
gradients come back these two different
 

1999
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,990
gradients come back these two different
gradients are competing with each other

2000
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:00,000
gradients are competing with each other
 

2001
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,069
gradients are competing with each other
in changing this encoder.

2002
00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:04,079

 

2003
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,030

Okay. Yeah.

2004
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
Okay. Yeah.
 

2005
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,470
Okay. Yeah.
>> How are we defining our desired

2006
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:06,480
>> How are we defining our desired
 

2007
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,589
>> How are we defining our desired
distribution?

2008
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:07,599
distribution?
 

2009
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,870
distribution?
>> Oh, this is just normal.

2010
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:10,880
>> Oh, this is just normal.
 

2011
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,069
>> Oh, this is just normal.
>> I'll just write that out. Sorry, I

2012
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:12,079
>> I'll just write that out. Sorry, I
 

2013
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,829
>> I'll just write that out. Sorry, I
didn't

2014
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:17,839

 

2015
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,309

we just made that choice. We pick it.

2016
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:20,319
we just made that choice. We pick it.
 

2017
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,589
we just made that choice. We pick it.
This is what we're going to sample from

2018
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599
This is what we're going to sample from
 

2019
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,790
This is what we're going to sample from
when we're going to do generations.

2020
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:24,800
when we're going to do generations.
 

2021
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,950
when we're going to do generations.
So then in that case we're saying we're

2022
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:26,960
So then in that case we're saying we're
 

2023
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,829
So then in that case we're saying we're
both trying to get it to look like

2024
00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:29,839
both trying to get it to look like
 

2025
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,230
both trying to get it to look like
normal but also trying to get it to look

2026
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
normal but also trying to get it to look
 

2027
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,790
normal but also trying to get it to look
good.

2028
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:34,800
good.
 

2029
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,030
good.
>> Yes. So these are conflicting. So you

2030
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,040
>> Yes. So these are conflicting. So you
 

2031
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,549
>> Yes. So these are conflicting. So you
have to you can play with this but now

2032
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:38,559
have to you can play with this but now
 

2033
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,470
have to you can play with this but now
this gives you so back to the question

2034
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:40,480
this gives you so back to the question
 

2035
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,470
this gives you so back to the question
that was raised earlier right is there

2036
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:42,480
that was raised earlier right is there
 

2037
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,910
that was raised earlier right is there
like a right way of setting that

2038
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:43,920
like a right way of setting that
 

2039
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,750
like a right way of setting that
information bottleneck that we can draw

2040
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:45,760
information bottleneck that we can draw
 

2041
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,630
information bottleneck that we can draw
the samples. So if you think about it,

2042
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:48,640
the samples. So if you think about it,
 

2043
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,069
the samples. So if you think about it,
choosing the weight you put on here,

2044
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:52,079
choosing the weight you put on here,
 

2045
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,710
choosing the weight you put on here,
right? The more weight on I put on here,

2046
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:54,720
right? The more weight on I put on here,
 

2047
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,270
right? The more weight on I put on here,
the more I want this to look like it's

2048
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:57,280
the more I want this to look like it's
 

2049
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,309
the more I want this to look like it's
completely uninformative,

2050
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:00,319
completely uninformative,
 

2051
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,950
completely uninformative,
right? This was zero. This is something

2052
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:02,960
right? This was zero. This is something
 

2053
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,109
right? This was zero. This is something
that doesn't change. Then seeing Z's

2054
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:05,119
that doesn't change. Then seeing Z's
 

2055
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,990
that doesn't change. Then seeing Z's
tells me nothing about X. That's what

2056
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,000
tells me nothing about X. That's what
 

2057
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,390
tells me nothing about X. That's what
makes this thing be happy.

2058
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:12,400
makes this thing be happy.
 

2059
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,309
makes this thing be happy.
So you can think about this is

2060
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:14,319
So you can think about this is
 

2061
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,950
So you can think about this is
modulating the strength of this loss is

2062
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:16,960
modulating the strength of this loss is
 

2063
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,870
modulating the strength of this loss is
controlling the amount of information

2064
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:18,880
controlling the amount of information
 

2065
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,790
controlling the amount of information
that can flow from here to here.

2066
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:24,800

 

2067
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,030

Okay. So this is like anformational

2068
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,040
Okay. So this is like anformational
 

2069
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,829
Okay. So this is like anformational
bottleneck not just a dimensional one.

2070
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:29,839
bottleneck not just a dimensional one.
 

2071
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,390
bottleneck not just a dimensional one.
And in fact you can connect it. This is

2072
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:32,400
And in fact you can connect it. This is
 

2073
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,790
And in fact you can connect it. This is
if you look at the relationship between

2074
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:34,800
if you look at the relationship between
 

2075
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,069
if you look at the relationship between
some of you might have seen this in a

2076
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:36,079
some of you might have seen this in a
 

2077
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,670
some of you might have seen this in a
class between KL divergence and

2078
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:37,680
class between KL divergence and
 

2079
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,910
class between KL divergence and
something called mutual information.

2080
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:39,920
something called mutual information.
 

2081
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,390
something called mutual information.
This is what's happening here. You're

2082
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,400
This is what's happening here. You're
 

2083
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,549
This is what's happening here. You're
constraining the mutual information

2084
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:44,559
constraining the mutual information
 

2085
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,069
constraining the mutual information
between Z and X

2086
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:48,079
between Z and X
 

2087
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,750
between Z and X
and that's a fine the important thing is

2088
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:49,760
and that's a fine the important thing is
 

2089
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,430
and that's a fine the important thing is
that's not a discrete quantity. That's a

2090
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:51,440
that's not a discrete quantity. That's a
 

2091
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,470
that's not a discrete quantity. That's a
fine control you have. Okay. So that's

2092
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
fine control you have. Okay. So that's
 

2093
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,589
fine control you have. Okay. So that's
one way of thinking about what's

2094
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:55,599
one way of thinking about what's
 

2095
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,910
one way of thinking about what's
happening here. Okay. So you have a fine

2096
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:57,920
happening here. Okay. So you have a fine
 

2097
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,510
happening here. Okay. So you have a fine
control on this bottleneck by adjusting

2098
00:49:59,510 --> 00:49:59,520
control on this bottleneck by adjusting
 

2099
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,870
control on this bottleneck by adjusting
the weight of this loss.

2100
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:02,880
the weight of this loss.
 

2101
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,670
the weight of this loss.
And so what people find is that if you

2102
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:05,680
And so what people find is that if you
 

2103
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,589
And so what people find is that if you
do a VAE and I think we'll make you do

2104
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:07,599
do a VAE and I think we'll make you do
 

2105
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,670
do a VAE and I think we'll make you do
it in the homework in the next homework

2106
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:09,680
it in the homework in the next homework
 

2107
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,910
it in the homework in the next homework
uh for like emnest you can play around

2108
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:11,920
uh for like emnest you can play around
 

2109
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,510
uh for like emnest you can play around
with this and kind of get the

2110
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:13,520
with this and kind of get the
 

2111
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,390
with this and kind of get the
generations to be much better than what

2112
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:16,400
generations to be much better than what
 

2113
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,270
generations to be much better than what
you would get with a straight

2114
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:17,280
you would get with a straight
 

2115
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,270
you would get with a straight
autoenccoder

2116
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:19,280
autoenccoder
 

2117
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,950
autoenccoder
and there's many many tricks people have

2118
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:20,960
and there's many many tricks people have
 

2119
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,270
and there's many many tricks people have
done on VAE to make them be very good

2120
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280
done on VAE to make them be very good
 

2121
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,750
done on VAE to make them be very good
but in general this tension is still

2122
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:27,760
but in general this tension is still
 

2123
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,549
but in general this tension is still
present. So if you make this,

2124
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:30,559
present. So if you make this,
 

2125
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,349
present. So if you make this,
why is this tension? If I make this loss

2126
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:33,359
why is this tension? If I make this loss
 

2127
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,910
why is this tension? If I make this loss
have a lot of weight, it's forcing there

2128
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:35,920
have a lot of weight, it's forcing there
 

2129
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,430
have a lot of weight, it's forcing there
to be less information that goes through

2130
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,440
to be less information that goes through
 

2131
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,790
to be less information that goes through
here, which makes the quality of this

2132
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:38,800
here, which makes the quality of this
 

2133
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,230
here, which makes the quality of this
reconstruction bad. But it also makes

2134
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:42,240
reconstruction bad. But it also makes
 

2135
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,630
reconstruction bad. But it also makes
this distribution that I see here or

2136
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:44,640
this distribution that I see here or
 

2137
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,630
this distribution that I see here or
that this is seen during training very

2138
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:46,640
that this is seen during training very
 

2139
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,069
that this is seen during training very
close to the distribution I'm sampling

2140
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:48,079
close to the distribution I'm sampling
 

2141
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,390
close to the distribution I'm sampling
from, which is what's letting the the

2142
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:50,400
from, which is what's letting the the
 

2143
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,150
from, which is what's letting the the
reconstructions be good.

2144
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,160
reconstructions be good.
 

2145
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,309
reconstructions be good.
Now if I from the generation point of

2146
00:50:58,309 --> 00:50:58,319
Now if I from the generation point of
 

2147
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:01,829
Now if I from the generation point of
view, so if I want to make this

2148
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:01,839
view, so if I want to make this
 

2149
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,670
view, so if I want to make this
reconstruction be very good, which means

2150
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:03,680
reconstruction be very good, which means
 

2151
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,109
reconstruction be very good, which means
I want this to generate very high

2152
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:05,119
I want this to generate very high
 

2153
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,589
I want this to generate very high
quality images, then there has to be a

2154
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:07,599
quality images, then there has to be a
 

2155
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,349
quality images, then there has to be a
lot of information from here to here.

2156
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
lot of information from here to here.
 

2157
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,030
lot of information from here to here.
But high quality image generation on

2158
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:13,040
But high quality image generation on
 

2159
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,589
But high quality image generation on
that side means that this distribution

2160
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:15,599
that side means that this distribution
 

2161
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,549
that side means that this distribution
is not going to be right.

2162
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:18,559
is not going to be right.
 

2163
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:25,270
is not going to be right.
Okay. So from a picture point of view,

2164
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,280

 

2165
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:39,030

come back here and copy this picture.

2166
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:39,040

 

2167
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,950

Oops.

2168
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:40,960
Oops.
 

2169
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,390
Oops.
Okay. This picture

2170
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:44,400
Okay. This picture
 

2171
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,630
Okay. This picture
shrink it.

2172
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:46,640
shrink it.
 

2173
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,309
shrink it.
Okay.

2174
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:50,319

 

2175
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,030

doing VAE training. You can think it's

2176
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,040
doing VAE training. You can think it's
 

2177
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,230
doing VAE training. You can think it's
in a different space, but what it

2178
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:54,240
in a different space, but what it
 

2179
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,630
in a different space, but what it
effectively does is it makes this

2180
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:58,640
effectively does is it makes this
 

2181
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,670
effectively does is it makes this
distribution

2182
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:01,680

 

2183
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,790

be more blobby around it. It creates

2184
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:06,800
be more blobby around it. It creates
 

2185
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,750
be more blobby around it. It creates
some width to it

2186
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:09,760
some width to it
 

2187
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,549
some width to it
because small variations are represented

2188
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:12,559
because small variations are represented
 

2189
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,030
because small variations are represented
in the training data because you added

2190
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:15,040
in the training data because you added
 

2191
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,190
in the training data because you added
this noise effectively. This is not

2192
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:17,200
this noise effectively. This is not
 

2193
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,390
this noise effectively. This is not
quite right. This is in the latent

2194
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
quite right. This is in the latent
 

2195
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,950
quite right. This is in the latent
space. So without adding doing VA

2196
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:20,960
space. So without adding doing VA
 

2197
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,150
space. So without adding doing VA
training in the latent space, you'd have

2198
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,160
training in the latent space, you'd have
 

2199
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,270
training in the latent space, you'd have
the same picture replicated in the

2200
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,280
the same picture replicated in the
 

2201
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,150
the same picture replicated in the
smaller dimensional space. And now by

2202
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,160
smaller dimensional space. And now by
 

2203
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,950
smaller dimensional space. And now by
doing this uh variational autoenccoder

2204
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:28,960
doing this uh variational autoenccoder
 

2205
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,790
doing this uh variational autoenccoder
training, I'm basically making this

2206
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:30,800
training, I'm basically making this
 

2207
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,710
training, I'm basically making this
instead of being a very thin set be like

2208
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:32,720
instead of being a very thin set be like
 

2209
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,750
instead of being a very thin set be like
a thicker set,

2210
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:35,760
a thicker set,
 

2211
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,950
a thicker set,
okay, that I can generate. And so

2212
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:40,960

 

2213
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,630

in that sense, you made the problem

2214
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:42,640
in that sense, you made the problem
 

2215
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,790
in that sense, you made the problem
easier even if you haven't fully solved

2216
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:44,800
easier even if you haven't fully solved
 

2217
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,630
easier even if you haven't fully solved
the problem. And that's the secret

2218
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:46,640
the problem. And that's the secret
 

2219
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,950
the problem. And that's the secret
behind why latent diffusion works, which

2220
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:48,960
behind why latent diffusion works, which
 

2221
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,270
behind why latent diffusion works, which
we'll talk about later. It's easier to

2222
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:51,280
we'll talk about later. It's easier to
 

2223
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,190
we'll talk about later. It's easier to
sample to learn to sample something

2224
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:53,200
sample to learn to sample something
 

2225
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,230
sample to learn to sample something
that's not you don't have to get it

2226
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:54,240
that's not you don't have to get it
 

2227
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,910
that's not you don't have to get it
exactly right. You just have to get

2228
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:55,920
exactly right. You just have to get
 

2229
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,430
exactly right. You just have to get
close.

2230
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:57,440
close.
 

2231
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,069
close.
Okay. But that we'll talk about later.

2232
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:00,079
Okay. But that we'll talk about later.
 

2233
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,630
Okay. But that we'll talk about later.
Okay. Now, any questions on how uh VAE

2234
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:04,640
Okay. Now, any questions on how uh VAE
 

2235
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,230
Okay. Now, any questions on how uh VAE
work? Yeah.

2236
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:06,240
work? Yeah.
 

2237
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,150
work? Yeah.
>> So, at generation time, you're sampling

2238
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:08,160
>> So, at generation time, you're sampling
 

2239
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,270
>> So, at generation time, you're sampling
V.

2240
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:09,280
V.
 

2241
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,870
V.
>> At s at generation time, all you're

2242
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:10,880
>> At s at generation time, all you're
 

2243
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,390
>> At s at generation time, all you're
going to do is sample V. And in this

2244
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400
going to do is sample V. And in this
 

2245
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,990
going to do is sample V. And in this
particular case, and you're simply not

2246
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:16,000
particular case, and you're simply not
 

2247
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,870
particular case, and you're simply not
going to do uh I mean, I guess you can

2248
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:20,880
going to do uh I mean, I guess you can
 

2249
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,069
going to do uh I mean, I guess you can
you're not going to set this mean you're

2250
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:22,079
you're not going to set this mean you're
 

2251
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,349
you're not going to set this mean you're
set this mean to zero. You're not going

2252
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:23,359
set this mean to zero. You're not going
 

2253
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:24,390
set this mean to zero. You're not going
to do anything here. It's going to run

2254
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:24,400
to do anything here. It's going to run
 

2255
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,990
to do anything here. It's going to run
straight through.

2256
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:26,000
straight through.
 

2257
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,309
straight through.
>> Okay?

2258
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:26,319
>> Okay?
 

2259
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,589
>> Okay?
>> Because you're going from the desired

2260
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:27,599
>> Because you're going from the desired
 

2261
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,030
>> Because you're going from the desired
distribution. You're going to pretend Z

2262
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,040
distribution. You're going to pretend Z
 

2263
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,549
distribution. You're going to pretend Z
is coming from a normal zero. So there

2264
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:32,559
is coming from a normal zero. So there
 

2265
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,030
is coming from a normal zero. So there
there are tricks, okay? So um that

2266
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040
there are tricks, okay? So um that
 

2267
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,470
there are tricks, okay? So um that
people used to do in the past. So I give

2268
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,480
people used to do in the past. So I give
 

2269
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,470
people used to do in the past. So I give
you a flavor of some of these tricks.

2270
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:38,480
you a flavor of some of these tricks.
 

2271
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,870
you a flavor of some of these tricks.
Um, one trick that people used to do,

2272
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
Um, one trick that people used to do,
 

2273
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,670
Um, one trick that people used to do,
um, is they would say, I take the

2274
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:43,680
um, is they would say, I take the
 

2275
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,670
um, is they would say, I take the
desired distribution, I run it through

2276
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
desired distribution, I run it through
 

2277
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,589
desired distribution, I run it through
the VAE. Okay? And now I get an image.

2278
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:51,599
the VAE. Okay? And now I get an image.
 

2279
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,109
the VAE. Okay? And now I get an image.
This image isn't quite right. So what

2280
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:55,119
This image isn't quite right. So what
 

2281
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,430
This image isn't quite right. So what
I'll do is I'll take this image and I'll

2282
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:57,440
I'll do is I'll take this image and I'll
 

2283
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,150
I'll do is I'll take this image and I'll
run it through the encoder.

2284
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:00,160
run it through the encoder.
 

2285
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,670
run it through the encoder.
And now I'll get something that's like

2286
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:01,680
And now I'll get something that's like
 

2287
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,390
And now I'll get something that's like
the distribution in the neighborhood of

2288
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:04,400
the distribution in the neighborhood of
 

2289
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,630
the distribution in the neighborhood of
that image. And I'll do this again with

2290
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:06,640
that image. And I'll do this again with
 

2291
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,030
that image. And I'll do this again with
another noise. So do a two-step

2292
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,040
another noise. So do a two-step
 

2293
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,470
another noise. So do a two-step
generation. There's like old tricks that

2294
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
generation. There's like old tricks that
 

2295
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,990
generation. There's like old tricks that
people used to do. They don't do these

2296
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
people used to do. They don't do these
 

2297
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,309
people used to do. They don't do these
trying to tricks as much anymore, but

2298
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:14,319
trying to tricks as much anymore, but
 

2299
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,750
trying to tricks as much anymore, but
because you have better ways of doing

2300
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:15,760
because you have better ways of doing
 

2301
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,470
because you have better ways of doing
this, but there is this tension and

2302
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:18,480
this, but there is this tension and
 

2303
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,870
this, but there is this tension and
people try to fix it. The current best

2304
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:20,880
people try to fix it. The current best
 

2305
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,470
people try to fix it. The current best
correct way of fixing it is to actually

2306
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:22,480
correct way of fixing it is to actually
 

2307
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,549
correct way of fixing it is to actually
use another method to sample from a

2308
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:24,559
use another method to sample from a
 

2309
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,390
use another method to sample from a
distribution that has some thickness

2310
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:26,400
distribution that has some thickness
 

2311
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,710
distribution that has some thickness
like a diffusion model.

2312
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:28,720
like a diffusion model.
 

2313
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,829
like a diffusion model.
>> Yeah.

2314
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:29,839
>> Yeah.
 

2315
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,990
>> Yeah.
>> If during inference time we're just

2316
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:32,000
>> If during inference time we're just
 

2317
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,150
>> If during inference time we're just
using the standard distribution, why

2318
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:34,160
using the standard distribution, why
 

2319
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,670
using the standard distribution, why
don't we just like that? That's a really

2320
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:37,680
don't we just like that? That's a really
 

2321
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,510
don't we just like that? That's a really
good question. So the question is why

2322
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:39,520
good question. So the question is why
 

2323
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,750
good question. So the question is why
don't you just train it in the following

2324
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:41,760
don't you just train it in the following
 

2325
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,309
don't you just train it in the following
way? Okay, so I'll repeat the question.

2326
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:44,319
way? Okay, so I'll repeat the question.
 

2327
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:47,510
way? Okay, so I'll repeat the question.
The question is if during generation

2328
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:47,520
The question is if during generation
 

2329
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,589
The question is if during generation
you're just going to be feeding it a

2330
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:49,599
you're just going to be feeding it a
 

2331
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,470
you're just going to be feeding it a
random noise in why don't we train it

2332
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
random noise in why don't we train it
 

2333
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,069
random noise in why don't we train it
that way? So let's think about what that

2334
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:54,079
that way? So let's think about what that
 

2335
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,270
that way? So let's think about what that
kind of training would look like. That

2336
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:55,280
kind of training would look like. That
 

2337
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,549
kind of training would look like. That
kind of training would eliminate the

2338
00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:56,559
kind of training would eliminate the
 

2339
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,829
kind of training would eliminate the
encoder entirely.

2340
00:54:59,829 --> 00:54:59,839
encoder entirely.
 

2341
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,829
encoder entirely.
Okay, so now think about the task you're

2342
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:01,839
Okay, so now think about the task you're
 

2343
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,230
Okay, so now think about the task you're
asking the neural to do. I have this

2344
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240
asking the neural to do. I have this
 

2345
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,190
asking the neural to do. I have this
specific picture of a cat.

2346
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:07,200
specific picture of a cat.
 

2347
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,990
specific picture of a cat.
Here's some random noise.

2348
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:10,000
Here's some random noise.
 

2349
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,750
Here's some random noise.
Predict this cat. Dakota will try. Okay.

2350
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:13,760
Predict this cat. Dakota will try. Okay.
 

2351
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,870
Predict this cat. Dakota will try. Okay.
Now you say, here's a picture of a dog.

2352
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:16,880
Now you say, here's a picture of a dog.
 

2353
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,270
Now you say, here's a picture of a dog.
Here's some new random noise that has

2354
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:19,280
Here's some new random noise that has
 

2355
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,230
Here's some new random noise that has
nothing to do with a dog. Please predict

2356
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:22,240
nothing to do with a dog. Please predict
 

2357
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,030
nothing to do with a dog. Please predict
that dog. It'll be like, how is it ever

2358
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,040
that dog. It'll be like, how is it ever
 

2359
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,710
that dog. It'll be like, how is it ever
going to do this? And then then then the

2360
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:26,720
going to do this? And then then then the
 

2361
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,309
going to do this? And then then then the
next batch comes around, right? You do

2362
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:28,319
next batch comes around, right? You do
 

2363
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,309
next batch comes around, right? You do
multi-pic training. The same picture of

2364
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:30,319
multi-pic training. The same picture of
 

2365
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,109
multi-pic training. The same picture of
a cat comes. Here's totally different

2366
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:33,119
a cat comes. Here's totally different
 

2367
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,470
a cat comes. Here's totally different
noise. Predict that same cat. It's not

2368
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:36,480
noise. Predict that same cat. It's not
 

2369
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,950
noise. Predict that same cat. It's not
possible, right? There's no way for it

2370
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:38,960
possible, right? There's no way for it
 

2371
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,670
possible, right? There's no way for it
to succeed at that task.

2372
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:41,680
to succeed at that task.
 

2373
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,309
to succeed at that task.
So, you can try it, but it doesn't work.

2374
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:44,319
So, you can try it, but it doesn't work.
 

2375
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,349
So, you can try it, but it doesn't work.
So, you have to have something to make

2376
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:47,359
So, you have to have something to make
 

2377
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,750
So, you have to have something to make
this distribution have something in Z

2378
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:49,760
this distribution have something in Z
 

2379
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,870
this distribution have something in Z
has to actually correspond to this

2380
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:52,880
has to actually correspond to this
 

2381
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,630
has to actually correspond to this
image.

2382
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
image.
 

2383
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,990
image.
It can't be pure noise.

2384
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:56,000
It can't be pure noise.
 

2385
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,230
It can't be pure noise.
>> But during inference, nothing really

2386
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
>> But during inference, nothing really
 

2387
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,910
>> But during inference, nothing really
corresponds to that.

2388
00:55:59,910 --> 00:55:59,920
corresponds to that.
 

2389
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,630
corresponds to that.
>> Yes. So during during operations you say

2390
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,640
>> Yes. So during during operations you say
 

2391
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,430
>> Yes. So during during operations you say
that this randomness will correspond to

2392
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:05,440
that this randomness will correspond to
 

2393
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,510
that this randomness will correspond to
hypothetical information that could be

2394
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:07,520
hypothetical information that could be
 

2395
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,150
hypothetical information that could be
in some image. So this is unconditional

2396
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:10,160
in some image. So this is unconditional
 

2397
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,510
in some image. So this is unconditional
generation. How to make this work

2398
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:11,520
generation. How to make this work
 

2399
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,950
generation. How to make this work
conditionally is like other you just add

2400
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:14,960
conditionally is like other you just add
 

2401
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,390
conditionally is like other you just add
conditioning into both. Okay. But like I

2402
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,400
conditioning into both. Okay. But like I
 

2403
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,670
conditioning into both. Okay. But like I
want to focus on the unconditional to

2404
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:19,680
want to focus on the unconditional to
 

2405
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,109
want to focus on the unconditional to
get the key idea of how VAS are working.

2406
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:23,119
get the key idea of how VAS are working.
 

2407
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,710
get the key idea of how VAS are working.
Any other questions on how VAS are

2408
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:24,720
Any other questions on how VAS are
 

2409
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,510
Any other questions on how VAS are
working? Yeah,

2410
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:25,520
working? Yeah,
 

2411
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,870
working? Yeah,

Ah, so
the entire problem of doing generation

2420
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:37,280
the entire problem of doing generation
 

2421
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,789
the entire problem of doing generation
requires you to sample from a

2422
00:56:38,789 --> 00:56:38,799
requires you to sample from a
 

2423
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,030
requires you to sample from a
distribution. Your computer is doing

2424
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:41,040
distribution. Your computer is doing
 

2425
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,910
distribution. Your computer is doing
deterministic steps. The only way you're

2426
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:43,920
deterministic steps. The only way you're
 

2427
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,589
deterministic steps. The only way you're
going to sample from a distribution is

2428
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:45,599
going to sample from a distribution is
 

2429
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,670
going to sample from a distribution is
to feed in some randomness and do some

2430
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:47,680
to feed in some randomness and do some
 

2431
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,390
to feed in some randomness and do some
transformation to it to get something.

any generative model is drawing upon
 

2437
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,910
any generative model is drawing upon
some source of randomness and

transforming it.
 

2441
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,150
transforming it.
This is like it doesn't matter what

2442
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
This is like it doesn't matter what
 

2443
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,510
This is like it doesn't matter what
technique you're doing. You must do

2444
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:03,520
technique you're doing. You must do
 

2445
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,910
technique you're doing. You must do
this. Everyone understand that? This is

2446
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:05,920
this. Everyone understand that? This is
 

2447
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,789
this. Everyone understand that? This is
it's a very basic thing. It's not a that

it's a very basic thing. It's not a that
 

2449

it's a very basic thing. It's not a that
has the consequence that I need to have

2450
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
has the consequence that I need to have
 

2451
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,750
has the consequence that I need to have
some randomness and feed it in. And

2452
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:11,760
some randomness and feed it in. And
 

2453
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,190
some randomness and feed it in. And
practically speaking, since I'm dealing

2454
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:13,200
practically speaking, since I'm dealing
 

2455
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,109
practically speaking, since I'm dealing
with vectors, I have to be able to put

2456
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
with vectors, I have to be able to put
 

2457
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,589
with vectors, I have to be able to put
that randomness in somehow. In this

2458
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:17,599
that randomness in somehow. In this
 

2459
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,390
that randomness in somehow. In this
case, I do it by having a vector, namely

2460
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,400
case, I do it by having a vector, namely
 

2461
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,150
case, I do it by having a vector, namely
Z, that I draw from some distribution.

2462
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:26,160

 

2463
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,750

In diffusion models, it'll play out

2464
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:27,760
In diffusion models, it'll play out
 

2465
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,390
In diffusion models, it'll play out
differently. how we do it.

2466
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:32,400

 

2467
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,670

Okay, so I want to recap what are some

2468
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:35,680
Okay, so I want to recap what are some
 

2469
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,829
Okay, so I want to recap what are some
new tricks that we've learned and sort

2470
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:37,839
new tricks that we've learned and sort
 

2471
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,109
new tricks that we've learned and sort
of think we have way of thinking.

2472
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:41,119
of think we have way of thinking.
 

2473
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,549
of think we have way of thinking.
First is we have talked about using kale

2474
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:44,559
First is we have talked about using kale
 

2475
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,309
First is we have talked about using kale
diversions as a regularizer on

2476
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:46,319
diversions as a regularizer on
 

2477
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,630
diversions as a regularizer on
distributions.

2478
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:48,640
distributions.
 

2479
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,270
distributions.
Okay, just you know we've had auxiliary

2480
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:51,280
Okay, just you know we've had auxiliary
 

2481
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,190
Okay, just you know we've had auxiliary
losses before. We introduced them in

2482
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:53,200
losses before. We introduced them in
 

2483
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,589
losses before. We introduced them in
diff pool. Now we have a new auxiliary

2484
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
diff pool. Now we have a new auxiliary
 

2485
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,589
diff pool. Now we have a new auxiliary
loss that we can use and it has the goal

2486
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:57,599
loss that we can use and it has the goal
 

2487
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,109
loss that we can use and it has the goal
of kind of making distributions go to

2488
00:57:59,109 --> 00:57:59,119
of kind of making distributions go to
 

2489
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,109
of kind of making distributions go to
what we want. So we learned this trick.

2490
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:03,119
what we want. So we learned this trick.
 

2491
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,270
what we want. So we learned this trick.
We've also

2492
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,280
We've also
 

2493
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,510
We've also
learned in lecture now you've seen it in

2494
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:07,520
learned in lecture now you've seen it in
 

2495
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,589
learned in lecture now you've seen it in
discussion not discussion you've seen it

2496
00:58:09,589 --> 00:58:09,599
discussion not discussion you've seen it
 

2497
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,950
discussion not discussion you've seen it
in a homework a way of treating sampling

2498
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:12,960
in a homework a way of treating sampling
 

2499
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,950
in a homework a way of treating sampling
in a way that allows gradients to just

2500
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:14,960
in a way that allows gradients to just
 

2501
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,230
in a way that allows gradients to just
pass through it. So you think about it,

2502
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
pass through it. So you think about it,
 

2503
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,870
pass through it. So you think about it,
what happened here is that

2504
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:20,880
what happened here is that
 

2505
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,950
what happened here is that
the gradient because of this plus where

2506
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
the gradient because of this plus where
 

2507
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,710
the gradient because of this plus where
we reconceptualize the sampling as

2508
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:24,720
we reconceptualize the sampling as
 

2509
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,190
we reconceptualize the sampling as
involving something with a plus and then

2510
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:27,200
involving something with a plus and then
 

2511
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,789
involving something with a plus and then
the gradient just flew straight through

2512
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:28,799
the gradient just flew straight through
 

2513
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,430
the gradient just flew straight through
because of the plus.

2514
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:31,440
because of the plus.
 

2515
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,069
because of the plus.
Okay, so we have a way of treating

2516
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:34,079
Okay, so we have a way of treating
 

2517
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,430
Okay, so we have a way of treating
sampling or a certain kind of we think

2518
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:37,440
sampling or a certain kind of we think
 

2519
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,190
sampling or a certain kind of we think
about sampling on from the mean

2520
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,200
about sampling on from the mean
 

2521
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,789
about sampling on from the mean
perspective. The mean there's the mean

2522
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:40,799
perspective. The mean there's the mean
 

2523
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,549
perspective. The mean there's the mean
and the coariance on the mean

2524
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:42,559
and the coariance on the mean
 

2525
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,589
and the coariance on the mean
perspective. The sampling is a kind of

2526
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:47,599
perspective. The sampling is a kind of
 

2527
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,510
perspective. The sampling is a kind of
perturbation that happens that's noisy

2528
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:51,520
perturbation that happens that's noisy
 

2529
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,670
perturbation that happens that's noisy
and the ideal version with no noise

2530
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:53,680
and the ideal version with no noise
 

2531
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,030
and the ideal version with no noise
would just be the same thing comes

2532
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,040
would just be the same thing comes
 

2533
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,150
would just be the same thing comes
through. And for the mean part, it just

2534
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,160
through. And for the mean part, it just
 

2535
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,430
through. And for the mean part, it just
passes the gradient straight back

2536
00:58:59,430 --> 00:58:59,440
passes the gradient straight back
 

2537
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,270
passes the gradient straight back
through.

2538
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:01,280
through.
 

2539
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,349
through.
Everyone see that? I'll talk more about

2540
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:03,359
Everyone see that? I'll talk more about
 

2541
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,710
Everyone see that? I'll talk more about
this in a moment to show you how this

2542
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,720
this in a moment to show you how this
 

2543
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,030
this in a moment to show you how this
idea generalizes.

2544
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:07,040
idea generalizes.
 

2545
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,430
idea generalizes.
And then we had this approach which said

2546
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:09,440
And then we had this approach which said
 

2547
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,950
And then we had this approach which said
that

2548
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:10,960
that
 

2549
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,190
that
if I'm going to have uh randomness in

2550
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:15,200
if I'm going to have uh randomness in
 

2551
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,589
if I'm going to have uh randomness in
the sampling, I can just think of it as

2552
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:17,599
the sampling, I can just think of it as
 

2553
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,270
the sampling, I can just think of it as
more stoasticity that I already have

2554
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:19,280
more stoasticity that I already have
 

2555
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,430
more stoasticity that I already have
with SGD.

2556
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:21,440
with SGD.
 

2557
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,390
with SGD.
And now I can train. I don't have to

2558
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:24,400
And now I can train. I don't have to
 

2559
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,670
And now I can train. I don't have to
like having already ex accepted that SGD

2560
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:27,680
like having already ex accepted that SGD
 

2561
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,109
like having already ex accepted that SGD
works, I'm like okay fine more

2562
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:31,119
works, I'm like okay fine more
 

2563
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,910
works, I'm like okay fine more
randomness that's okay too.

2564
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:33,920
randomness that's okay too.
 

2565
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,710
randomness that's okay too.
So the key the key conceptually if if

2566
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:36,720
So the key the key conceptually if if
 

2567
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,030
So the key the key conceptually if if
you didn't have an already existing

2568
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,040
you didn't have an already existing
 

2569
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,430
you didn't have an already existing
acceptance of SGD this would be a hard

2570
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:41,440
acceptance of SGD this would be a hard
 

2571
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,510
acceptance of SGD this would be a hard
step to accept but you're already

2572
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:43,520
step to accept but you're already
 

2573
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,589
step to accept but you're already
accepting SGD and so it's no longer as

2574
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:45,599
accepting SGD and so it's no longer as
 

2575
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:50,549
accepting SGD and so it's no longer as
hard just treated as part of your input.

2576
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:50,559

 

2577
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,950

Okay. So I just want to point this out

2578
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:52,960
Okay. So I just want to point this out
 

2579
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,630
Okay. So I just want to point this out
explicitly. Um because as a student I

2580
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:56,640
explicitly. Um because as a student I
 

2581
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,390
explicitly. Um because as a student I
know many students will this you you'll

2582
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:58,400
know many students will this you you'll
 

2583
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,829
know many students will this you you'll
keep getting you'll find yourself

2584
00:59:59,829 --> 00:59:59,839
keep getting you'll find yourself
 

2585
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:01,030
keep getting you'll find yourself
thinking about you'll get what's going

2586
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:01,040
thinking about you'll get what's going
 

2587
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,950
thinking about you'll get what's going
on here just to remember okay if there's

2588
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:04,960
on here just to remember okay if there's
 

2589
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,549
on here just to remember okay if there's
something you don't quite understand

2590
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:06,559
something you don't quite understand
 

2591
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,069
something you don't quite understand
think if you can see if you can think

2592
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:08,079
think if you can see if you can think
 

2593
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,150
think if you can see if you can think
like it like an expectation if you're

2594
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:10,160
like it like an expectation if you're
 

2595
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,829
like it like an expectation if you're
happy with it when it's an expectation

2596
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:11,839
happy with it when it's an expectation
 

2597
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:15,670
happy with it when it's an expectation
just say std expectation to examples we

2598
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:15,680
just say std expectation to examples we
 

2599
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,430
just say std expectation to examples we
did this before for example we tal we

2600
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:17,440
did this before for example we tal we
 

2601
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,630
did this before for example we tal we
gave you homework problems when you're

2602
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:18,640
gave you homework problems when you're
 

2603
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,750
gave you homework problems when you're
working about thinking about data

2604
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:19,760
working about thinking about data
 

2605
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,990
working about thinking about data
augmentation right we added noise to you

2606
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:22,000
augmentation right we added noise to you
 

2607
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,349
augmentation right we added noise to you
this is like it's treating this

2608
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:23,359
this is like it's treating this
 

2609
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,109
this is like it's treating this
expectation remember it's just that

2610
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:25,119
expectation remember it's just that
 

2611
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,030
expectation remember it's just that
again.

2612
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:27,040
again.
 

2613
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,710
again.
So we've warmed you up to accept this.

2614
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:30,720
So we've warmed you up to accept this.
 

2615
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,470
So we've warmed you up to accept this.
Okay. So I want to spend a little bit of

2616
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:34,480
Okay. So I want to spend a little bit of
 

2617
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,470
Okay. So I want to spend a little bit of
time talking about how these tricks are

2618
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:36,480
time talking about how these tricks are
 

2619
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,710
time talking about how these tricks are
useful beyond this VAE setting. Um we're

2620
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:40,720
useful beyond this VAE setting. Um we're
 

2621
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,990
useful beyond this VAE setting. Um we're
going to use them more when we talk

2622
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,000
going to use them more when we talk
 

2623
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,069
going to use them more when we talk
about post training, but I want to make

2624
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:44,079
about post training, but I want to make
 

2625
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,589
about post training, but I want to make
sure you understand it's not just about

2626
01:00:45,589 --> 01:00:45,599
sure you understand it's not just about
 

2627
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,829
sure you understand it's not just about
post training.

2628
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:47,839
post training.
 

2629
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,589
post training.
So one thing that you may or may not

2630
01:00:49,589 --> 01:00:49,599
So one thing that you may or may not
 

2631
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,670
So one thing that you may or may not
have heard about um is quantization

2632
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:51,680
have heard about um is quantization
 

2633
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,750
have heard about um is quantization
aware training.

2634
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:53,760
aware training.
 

2635
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,030
aware training.
So what's quantization aware training?

2636
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:57,040
So what's quantization aware training?
 

2637
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,750
So what's quantization aware training?
Uh let me uh rather than giving you all

2638
01:00:59,750 --> 01:00:59,760
Uh let me uh rather than giving you all
 

2639
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,030
Uh let me uh rather than giving you all
the text I'll just like talk what the

2640
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:01,040
the text I'll just like talk what the
 

2641
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,390
the text I'll just like talk what the
problem is first. So quantization aware

2642
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:04,400
problem is first. So quantization aware
 

2643
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,390
problem is first. So quantization aware
training is a very practical problem. It

2644
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:06,400
training is a very practical problem. It
 

2645
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,589
training is a very practical problem. It
says in real life when you have these

2646
01:01:09,589 --> 01:01:09,599
says in real life when you have these
 

2647
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,589
says in real life when you have these
models that are big. So when people saw

2648
01:01:11,589 --> 01:01:11,599
models that are big. So when people saw
 

2649
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,670
models that are big. So when people saw
these models when they got big were

2650
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:13,680
these models when they got big were
 

2651
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,670
these models when they got big were
having high performance they became a

2652
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:15,680
having high performance they became a
 

2653
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,589
having high performance they became a
real question of how big of a model can

2654
01:01:17,589 --> 01:01:17,599
real question of how big of a model can
 

2655
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,670
real question of how big of a model can
you run? So you have a laptop how big of

2656
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:19,680
you run? So you have a laptop how big of
 

2657
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,349
you run? So you have a laptop how big of
an LM can you run on your laptop?

2658
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:23,359
an LM can you run on your laptop?
 

2659
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:27,589
an LM can you run on your laptop?
So the the difference between using

2660
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:27,599
So the the difference between using
 

2661
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,990
So the the difference between using
floats float 32 and using int4 which is

2662
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:32,000
floats float 32 and using int4 which is
 

2663
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,630
floats float 32 and using int4 which is
a four bit integer. So four bit 16 only

2664
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:34,640
a four bit integer. So four bit 16 only
 

2665
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,470
a four bit integer. So four bit 16 only
16 values. It's like okay four bit

2666
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:38,480
16 values. It's like okay four bit
 

2667
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,589
16 values. It's like okay four bit
integers are a lot less expressive but

2668
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:41,599
integers are a lot less expressive but
 

2669
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,829
integers are a lot less expressive but
they're a lot smaller.

2670
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:43,839
they're a lot smaller.
 

2671
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,470
they're a lot smaller.
So I could fit a model that's eight

2672
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:46,480
So I could fit a model that's eight
 

2673
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,270
So I could fit a model that's eight
times larger

2674
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:49,280
times larger
 

2675
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,870
times larger
than 30 floats. So it's a big deal,

2676
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:52,880
than 30 floats. So it's a big deal,
 

2677
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,150
than 30 floats. So it's a big deal,
right? Also, the GPUs can do the

2678
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:56,160
right? Also, the GPUs can do the
 

2679
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,710
right? Also, the GPUs can do the
processing on 4bit a lot faster than

2680
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:58,720
processing on 4bit a lot faster than
 

2681
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,990
processing on 4bit a lot faster than
they can do processing. So I can do

2682
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,000
they can do processing. So I can do
 

2683
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,190
they can do processing. So I can do
mixed precision. So there's lots of

2684
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200
mixed precision. So there's lots of
 

2685
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,349
mixed precision. So there's lots of
reasons to want to use lower precision

2686
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:03,359
reasons to want to use lower precision
 

2687
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,109
reasons to want to use lower precision
practically once big models become a

2688
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:05,119
practically once big models become a
 

2689
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,549
practically once big models become a
thing. Before big models are a thing,

2690
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:06,559
thing. Before big models are a thing,
 

2691
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,910
thing. Before big models are a thing,
it's not a big deal. But big models are

2692
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:07,920
it's not a big deal. But big models are
 

2693
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,630
it's not a big deal. But big models are
a thing. So it is a big deal. So now the

2694
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:10,640
a thing. So it is a big deal. So now the
 

2695
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,549
a thing. So it is a big deal. So now the
question is how are you going to get a

2696
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:12,559
question is how are you going to get a
 

2697
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,670
question is how are you going to get a
model to fit on a constrained piece of

2698
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:15,680
model to fit on a constrained piece of
 

2699
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,750
model to fit on a constrained piece of
hardware?

2700
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:17,760
hardware?
 

2701
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,510
hardware?
old style was you trained the model some

2702
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:19,520
old style was you trained the model some
 

2703
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,990
old style was you trained the model some
way and then you said okay now I'm going

2704
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,000
way and then you said okay now I'm going
 

2705
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,630
way and then you said okay now I'm going
to quantize it and just straight up

2706
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:24,640
to quantize it and just straight up
 

2707
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,230
to quantize it and just straight up
quantized it took all the values and

2708
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:26,240
quantized it took all the values and
 

2709
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,150
quantized it took all the values and
quantized it then it was like oh wait

2710
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:28,160
quantized it then it was like oh wait
 

2711
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,670
quantized it then it was like oh wait
this doesn't work that well when I go to

2712
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
this doesn't work that well when I go to
 

2713
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,150
this doesn't work that well when I go to
drastic levels of quantization so what

2714
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:32,160
drastic levels of quantization so what
 

2715
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,390
drastic levels of quantization so what
can I do one way that people used to do

2716
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:34,400
can I do one way that people used to do
 

2717
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,069
can I do one way that people used to do
it was they would take the model and

2718
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:36,079
it was they would take the model and
 

2719
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,910
it was they would take the model and
then progressively quantize it and

2720
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:37,920
then progressively quantize it and
 

2721
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,470
then progressively quantize it and
fine-tune it on data after being

2722
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:40,480
fine-tune it on data after being
 

2723
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,309
fine-tune it on data after being
quantized to make sure it was like still

2724
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:42,319
quantized to make sure it was like still
 

2725
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:45,430
quantized to make sure it was like still
working okay to shape it a bit

2726
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:45,440
working okay to shape it a bit
 

2727
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,670
working okay to shape it a bit
quantization aware training was That

2728
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:47,680
quantization aware training was That
 

2729
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,190
quantization aware training was That
idea was that if I'm going to be

2730
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:49,200
idea was that if I'm going to be
 

2731
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,630
idea was that if I'm going to be
training a model, so it's going to be

2732
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:50,640
training a model, so it's going to be
 

2733
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,470
training a model, so it's going to be
quantized, is there anything I can do

2734
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:52,480
quantized, is there anything I can do
 

2735
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,390
quantized, is there anything I can do
during training that will make it better

2736
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:54,400
during training that will make it better
 

2737
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,390
during training that will make it better
at being quantized.

2738
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,400
at being quantized.
 

2739
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,230
at being quantized.
And so the idea is the best thing I'd

2740
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:58,240
And so the idea is the best thing I'd
 

2741
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,069
And so the idea is the best thing I'd
like to do is to train how I'm going to

2742
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:00,079
like to do is to train how I'm going to
 

2743
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,630
like to do is to train how I'm going to
test, right? So I'd like to quantize it

2744
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:02,640
test, right? So I'd like to quantize it
 

2745
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,190
test, right? So I'd like to quantize it
during training, but that's absurd. I

2746
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:05,200
during training, but that's absurd. I
 

2747
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,549
during training, but that's absurd. I
can't quantize it during training

2748
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:06,559
can't quantize it during training
 

2749
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:08,390
can't quantize it during training
because if I the quantization step,

2750
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:08,400
because if I the quantization step,
 

2751
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,510
because if I the quantization step,
rounding is not differentiable.

2752
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:11,520
rounding is not differentiable.
 

2753
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,870
rounding is not differentiable.
Does everyone see this? This is the

2754
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:12,880
Does everyone see this? This is the
 

2755
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,910
Does everyone see this? This is the
problem. So the idea was how do you have

2756
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:15,920
problem. So the idea was how do you have
 

2757
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,710
problem. So the idea was how do you have
your cake and eat it too, right? And the

2758
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,720
your cake and eat it too, right? And the
 

2759
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,430
your cake and eat it too, right? And the
way you do it is you say that during

2760
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:21,440
way you do it is you say that during
 

2761
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,789
way you do it is you say that during
training I'm going to stay in high

2762
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:22,799
training I'm going to stay in high
 

2763
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,549
training I'm going to stay in high
precision

2764
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:24,559
precision
 

2765
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,190
precision
so I can do the training

2766
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:27,200
so I can do the training
 

2767
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,910
so I can do the training
but when I do the forward pass I will

2768
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:29,920
but when I do the forward pass I will
 

2769
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,190
but when I do the forward pass I will
quantize my 32-bit numbers down to in 16

2770
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,200
quantize my 32-bit numbers down to in 16
 

2771
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,069
quantize my 32-bit numbers down to in 16
in 8 you know or you know four bit

2772
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:36,079
in 8 you know or you know four bit
 

2773
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,029
in 8 you know or you know four bit
floats whatever I'll do the quantization

2774
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:39,039
floats whatever I'll do the quantization
 

2775
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,589
floats whatever I'll do the quantization
in the forward pass.

2776
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:41,599
in the forward pass.
 

2777
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,470
in the forward pass.
So the actual action will be of the

2778
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:44,480
So the actual action will be of the
 

2779
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,430
So the actual action will be of the
quantized weights.

2780
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:47,440
quantized weights.
 

2781
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,069
quantized weights.
But now this is not differentiable. So

2782
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:50,079
But now this is not differentiable. So
 

2783
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:52,390
But now this is not differentiable. So
what am I going to do? I'm going to say

2784
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:52,400
what am I going to do? I'm going to say
 

2785
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,190
what am I going to do? I'm going to say
I can think about quantization as adding

2786
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:55,200
I can think about quantization as adding
 

2787
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,710
I can think about quantization as adding
noise.

2788
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:58,720

 

2789
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,710

And then I'll just pass the I'll just

2790
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:00,720
And then I'll just pass the I'll just
 

2791
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,470
And then I'll just pass the I'll just
pass the gradients straight back through

2792
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:02,480
pass the gradients straight back through
 

2793
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,990
pass the gradients straight back through
it

2794
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:04,000
it
 

2795
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,390
it
as though it were differentiable as

2796
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:06,400
as though it were differentiable as
 

2797
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,430
as though it were differentiable as
though it was just the identity.

2798
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:09,440
though it was just the identity.
 

2799
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,589
though it was just the identity.
Okay. So I'll conceptually I'll say I'll

2800
01:04:11,589 --> 01:04:11,599
Okay. So I'll conceptually I'll say I'll
 

2801
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,190
Okay. So I'll conceptually I'll say I'll
take quantization treat like additive

2802
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:13,200
take quantization treat like additive
 

2803
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,710
take quantization treat like additive
noise

2804
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:14,720
noise
 

2805
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,109
noise
then I'll just have the gradients pass

2806
01:04:17,109 --> 01:04:17,119
then I'll just have the gradients pass
 

2807
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,309
then I'll just have the gradients pass
on the additive part they'll go to the

2808
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:18,319
on the additive part they'll go to the
 

2809
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,990
on the additive part they'll go to the
noise and the noise will tank it doesn't

2810
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:20,000
noise and the noise will tank it doesn't
 

2811
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,670
noise and the noise will tank it doesn't
have any gradients on that nothing no

2812
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:21,680
have any gradients on that nothing no
 

2813
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,750
have any gradients on that nothing no
effect and it'll just pass through I do

2814
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:23,760
effect and it'll just pass through I do
 

2815
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,789
effect and it'll just pass through I do
that

2816
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:26,799

 

2817
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:31,190

this approach helps and current models

2818
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:31,200
this approach helps and current models
 

2819
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,750
this approach helps and current models
that are um used do this because they

2820
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:35,760
that are um used do this because they
 

2821
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,789
that are um used do this because they
know they're going to be quantized I

2822
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:36,799
know they're going to be quantized I
 

2823
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,750
know they're going to be quantized I
think the Kimmy paper and many of The

2824
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:39,760
think the Kimmy paper and many of The
 

2825
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,190
think the Kimmy paper and many of The
latest papers talk about how they

2826
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:41,200
latest papers talk about how they
 

2827
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,630
latest papers talk about how they
explicitly do this during their

explicitly do this during their
training.

2830
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,280
training.
 

2831
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,190
training.
Okay, any questions? You see how this is

2832
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:47,200
Okay, any questions? You see how this is
 

2833
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,829
Okay, any questions? You see how this is
the application of the same idea. Once I

2834
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:49,839
the application of the same idea. Once I
 

2835
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,150
the application of the same idea. Once I
can think about sampling by adding

2836
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:52,160
can think about sampling by adding
 

2837
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,510
can think about sampling by adding
noise, I can think about other things

2838
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:53,520
noise, I can think about other things
 

2839
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,270
noise, I can think about other things
that I conceptualizes adding noise like

2840
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:55,280
that I conceptualizes adding noise like
 

2841
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,029
that I conceptualizes adding noise like
quantization which is in DSP thought

2842
01:04:57,029 --> 01:04:57,039
quantization which is in DSP thought
 

2843
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:59,910
quantization which is in DSP thought
about as a way of adding of noise along

2844
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920
about as a way of adding of noise along
 

2845
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,150
about as a way of adding of noise along
with rescaling and I can just treat it

2846
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:02,160
with rescaling and I can just treat it
 

2847
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,589
with rescaling and I can just treat it
the same way.

2848
01:05:05,589 --> 01:05:05,599

 

2849
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,470

Very practically important. In homework,

2850
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:08,480
Very practically important. In homework,
 

2851
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,829
Very practically important. In homework,
you saw how the same ideas can be used

2852
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:11,839
you saw how the same ideas can be used
 

2853
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,750
you saw how the same ideas can be used
to do deal with non-ifferiable losses

2854
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:15,760
to do deal with non-ifferiable losses
 

2855
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,510
to do deal with non-ifferiable losses
which we're going to talk about next.

2856
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:19,520
which we're going to talk about next.
 

2857
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,789
which we're going to talk about next.
All of these ideas are useful across the

2858
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:22,799
All of these ideas are useful across the
 

2859
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,029
All of these ideas are useful across the
board. We'll we'll be hitting this. So

2860
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:25,039
board. We'll we'll be hitting this. So
 

2861
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,029
board. We'll we'll be hitting this. So
that's why VAS are a good place to teach

2862
01:05:27,029 --> 01:05:27,039
that's why VAS are a good place to teach
 

2863
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,670
that's why VAS are a good place to teach
start for teaching. Like lots of ideas I

2864
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:29,680
start for teaching. Like lots of ideas I
 

2865
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,029
start for teaching. Like lots of ideas I
can introduce in a simple setting.

2866
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,039
can introduce in a simple setting.
 

2867
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,230
can introduce in a simple setting.
Okay. Now I want to switch in accelerate

2868
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:36,240
Okay. Now I want to switch in accelerate
 

2869
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,069
Okay. Now I want to switch in accelerate
a little bit ahead of the schedule that

2870
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:38,079
a little bit ahead of the schedule that
 

2871
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:39,670
a little bit ahead of the schedule that
we posted on the website because I want

2872
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:39,680
we posted on the website because I want
 

2873
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,230
we posted on the website because I want
to give myself more time. Um start

2874
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:42,240
to give myself more time. Um start
 

2875
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,670
to give myself more time. Um start
talking about uh post training ideas

2876
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:45,680
talking about uh post training ideas
 

2877
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,630
talking about uh post training ideas
because they're very very important. Um

2878
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:48,640
because they're very very important. Um
 

2879
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,950
because they're very very important. Um
so let's see if we can start doing that.

2880
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:50,960
so let's see if we can start doing that.
 

2881
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,470
so let's see if we can start doing that.
Okay. So my goal is to help you

2882
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:54,480
Okay. So my goal is to help you
 

2883
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,190
Okay. So my goal is to help you
understand post training including

2884
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:57,200
understand post training including
 

2885
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,549
understand post training including
what's called RLVR which is the e easier

2886
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:00,559
what's called RLVR which is the e easier
 

2887
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:02,549
what's called RLVR which is the e easier
way to understand things and from my

2888
01:06:02,549 --> 01:06:02,559
way to understand things and from my
 

2889
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:03,990
way to understand things and from my
perspective for you and the students in

2890
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:04,000
perspective for you and the students in
 

2891
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,910
perspective for you and the students in
the class we would we would like is we

2892
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:05,920
the class we would we would like is we
 

2893
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,829
the class we would we would like is we
would like you to understand um RLVR

2894
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:09,839
would like you to understand um RLVR
 

2895
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,230
would like you to understand um RLVR
first because it's easier to understand

2896
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:12,240
first because it's easier to understand
 

2897
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,710
first because it's easier to understand
and then think about RLHF which is

2898
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
and then think about RLHF which is
 

2899
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,910
and then think about RLHF which is
reinforcement learning from human

2900
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:15,920
reinforcement learning from human
 

2901
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,750
reinforcement learning from human
feedback as tweaks on RLVR as opposed to

2902
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:19,760
feedback as tweaks on RLVR as opposed to
 

2903
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,870
feedback as tweaks on RLVR as opposed to
historic the historical order of

2904
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
historic the historical order of
 

2905
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,789
historic the historical order of
development.

2906
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:22,799
development.
 

2907
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:26,390
development.
This is easier to understand.

2908
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:26,400
This is easier to understand.
 

2909
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,990
This is easier to understand.
So

2910
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:28,000
So
 

2911
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,029
So
let's think about the problem. Remember

2912
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:31,039
let's think about the problem. Remember
 

2913
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,829
let's think about the problem. Remember
we had this basic approach of doing uh

2914
01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:33,839
we had this basic approach of doing uh
 

2915
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:35,510
we had this basic approach of doing uh
supervised fine-tuning for instruction

2916
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:35,520
supervised fine-tuning for instruction
 

2917
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,670
supervised fine-tuning for instruction
following. Remember we had a model, we

2918
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:37,680
following. Remember we had a model, we
 

2919
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,190
following. Remember we had a model, we
pre-trained it with next token

2920
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,200
pre-trained it with next token
 

2921
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,950
pre-trained it with next token
prediction um on corpuses of natural

2922
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:42,960
prediction um on corpuses of natural
 

2923
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,910
prediction um on corpuses of natural
text. Uh and then we want to make it so

2924
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:45,920
text. Uh and then we want to make it so
 

2925
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,750
text. Uh and then we want to make it so
it actually answers questions. Question

2926
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:47,760
it actually answers questions. Question
 

2927
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,910
it actually answers questions. Question
answering is not that well represented

2928
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:49,920
answering is not that well represented
 

2929
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,309
answering is not that well represented
in natural text. So we have new

2930
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:54,319
in natural text. So we have new
 

2931
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:57,430
in natural text. So we have new
supervised examples which have questions

2932
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:57,440
supervised examples which have questions
 

2933
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,670
supervised examples which have questions
prompt tokens and answers that we want

2934
01:06:59,670 --> 01:06:59,680
prompt tokens and answers that we want
 

2935
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,150
prompt tokens and answers that we want
and we just train the model to answer

2936
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:02,160
and we just train the model to answer
 

2937
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,230
and we just train the model to answer
these questions and don't train it on

2938
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,240
these questions and don't train it on
 

2939
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,750
these questions and don't train it on
generating the questions themselves.

2940
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:05,760
generating the questions themselves.
 

2941
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,670
generating the questions themselves.
There's no reason to do that just on the

2942
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:07,680
There's no reason to do that just on the
 

2943
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,829
There's no reason to do that just on the
answering. So you do this kind of thing

2944
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:09,839
answering. So you do this kind of thing
 

2945
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:12,789
answering. So you do this kind of thing
for instruction following.

2946
01:07:12,789 --> 01:07:12,799
for instruction following.
 

2947
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:15,750
for instruction following.
So this everyone remembers this.

2948
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:15,760
So this everyone remembers this.
 

2949
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,549
So this everyone remembers this.
Okay, great. So when people did this,

2950
01:07:20,549 --> 01:07:20,559
Okay, great. So when people did this,
 

2951
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,109
Okay, great. So when people did this,
when the in the sort of wild era of

2952
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:23,119
when the in the sort of wild era of
 

2953
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,750
when the in the sort of wild era of
human prompt optimization, people

2954
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:25,760
human prompt optimization, people
 

2955
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,230
human prompt optimization, people
discovered that if you told the model to

2956
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:30,240
discovered that if you told the model to
 

2957
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,109
discovered that if you told the model to
think step by step, it would give better

2958
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:33,119
think step by step, it would give better
 

2959
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,630
think step by step, it would give better
answers

2960
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:34,640
answers
 

2961
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,230
answers
because in this training data when it

2962
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:36,240
because in this training data when it
 

2963
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,829
because in this training data when it
saw let me think about this step by

2964
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:37,839
saw let me think about this step by
 

2965
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,910
saw let me think about this step by
step, it saw a bunch of steps written

2966
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:39,920
step, it saw a bunch of steps written
 

2967
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,710
step, it saw a bunch of steps written
out and so it starts doing that and then

2968
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:42,720
out and so it starts doing that and then
 

2969
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,390
out and so it starts doing that and then
by following the steps bit by bit, it

2970
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:44,400
by following the steps bit by bit, it
 

2971
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,309
by following the steps bit by bit, it
could get better answers. Okay, this is

2972
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:46,319
could get better answers. Okay, this is
 

2973
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:48,789
could get better answers. Okay, this is
called chain of thought.

2974
01:07:48,789 --> 01:07:48,799
called chain of thought.
 

2975
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:52,710
called chain of thought.
So because of the fact that people saw

2976
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:52,720
So because of the fact that people saw
 

2977
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,270
So because of the fact that people saw
that it's good to have chin of thought

2978
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:55,280
that it's good to have chin of thought
 

2979
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,910
that it's good to have chin of thought
prompting was working to make better

2980
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920
prompting was working to make better
 

2981
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,430
prompting was working to make better
answers, people said, you know what,

2982
01:07:59,430 --> 01:07:59,440
answers, people said, you know what,
 

2983
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,029
answers, people said, you know what,
even in our pre-training mix, we should

2984
01:08:01,029 --> 01:08:01,039
even in our pre-training mix, we should
 

2985
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,990
even in our pre-training mix, we should
have more examples that look like this,

2986
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:04,000
have more examples that look like this,
 

2987
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,990
have more examples that look like this,
that have stuff worked out step by step.

2988
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,000
that have stuff worked out step by step.
 

2989
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,349
that have stuff worked out step by step.
And so you generate synthetic examples

2990
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:07,359
And so you generate synthetic examples
 

2991
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,109
And so you generate synthetic examples
that look like this. So you add that to

2992
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:09,119
that look like this. So you add that to
 

2993
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,670
that look like this. So you add that to
your pre-training mix.

2994
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:11,680
your pre-training mix.
 

2995
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,910
your pre-training mix.
Okay, so this is the reality of actual

2996
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:15,920
Okay, so this is the reality of actual
 

2997
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,309
Okay, so this is the reality of actual
uh training today doesn't cleanly divide

2998
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:18,319
uh training today doesn't cleanly divide
 

2999
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,749
uh training today doesn't cleanly divide
into pre-training and post-training.

3000
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:21,759
into pre-training and post-training.
 

3001
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:24,390
into pre-training and post-training.
It's like shades. There's pre-training

3002
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:24,400
It's like shades. There's pre-training
 

3003
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,349
It's like shades. There's pre-training
and there's like something called

3004
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:25,359
and there's like something called
 

3005
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,590
and there's like something called
mid-training where people will adjust

3006
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:27,600
mid-training where people will adjust
 

3007
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,990
mid-training where people will adjust
the mix of data to have more of this

3008
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:30,000
the mix of data to have more of this
 

3009
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,070
the mix of data to have more of this
kind of stuff mixed in that it's going

3010
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:32,080
kind of stuff mixed in that it's going
 

3011
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,229
kind of stuff mixed in that it's going
to see and then shifting into you know

3012
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:34,239
to see and then shifting into you know
 

3013
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:36,789
to see and then shifting into you know
post-training afterwards. So this is all

3014
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:36,799
post-training afterwards. So this is all
 

3015
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,110
post-training afterwards. So this is all
stuff that people do.

3016
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:39,120
stuff that people do.
 

3017
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,070
stuff that people do.
Okay. So now the question becomes how

3018
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:42,080
Okay. So now the question becomes how
 

3019
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,550
Okay. So now the question becomes how
can we make a model better at solving

3020
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:44,560
can we make a model better at solving
 

3021
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,630
can we make a model better at solving
problems beyond just doing this.

3022
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
problems beyond just doing this.
 

3023
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,030
problems beyond just doing this.
So this is supervised fine-tuning only

3024
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,040
So this is supervised fine-tuning only
 

3025
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,309
So this is supervised fine-tuning only
so far

3026
01:08:54,309 --> 01:08:54,319

 

3027
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,749

and um historically this is sort of if

3028
01:08:57,749 --> 01:08:57,759
and um historically this is sort of if
 

3029
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,789
and um historically this is sort of if
you go back to

3030
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:00,799
you go back to
 

3031
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:04,470
you go back to
uh the first model that kind of broke

3032
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:04,480
uh the first model that kind of broke
 

3033
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,470
uh the first model that kind of broke
this door wide open was fall 24 the

3034
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:08,480
this door wide open was fall 24 the
 

3035
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,510
this door wide open was fall 24 the
introduction of

3036
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:11,520
introduction of
 

3037
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,189
introduction of

3039
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:19,110
uh GPT 401.
Okay, GPD 401 was what was the first

3040
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:19,120
Okay, GPD 401 was what was the first
 

3041
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,669
Okay, GPD 401 was what was the first
kind of thinking model, reasoning model

3042
01:09:21,669 --> 01:09:21,679
kind of thinking model, reasoning model
 

3043
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,349
kind of thinking model, reasoning model
which was trained in a way that got made

3044
01:09:23,349 --> 01:09:23,359
which was trained in a way that got made

techniques related to RLVR

3048
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:29,120
techniques related to RLVR
 

3049
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,269
techniques related to RLVR
that was followed. It was a black box.

3050
01:09:31,269 --> 01:09:31,279
that was followed. It was a black box.
 

3051
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,990
that was followed. It was a black box.
Although we saw talks um at Berkeley um

3052
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:34,000
Although we saw talks um at Berkeley um
 

3053
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,870
Although we saw talks um at Berkeley um
by Sebc uh who basically hinted very

3054
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:38,880
by Sebc uh who basically hinted very
 

3055
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,149
by Sebc uh who basically hinted very
strongly in the talks that we can't tell

3056
01:09:42,149 --> 01:09:42,159
strongly in the talks that we can't tell
 

3057
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:44,070
strongly in the talks that we can't tell
you how you do it but just do the thing

3058
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:44,080
you how you do it but just do the thing
 

3059
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,070
you how you do it but just do the thing
you think you'd do right and that works

3060
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,080
you think you'd do right and that works
 

3061
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,229
you think you'd do right and that works
okay are you doing this he goes no we

3062
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:50,239
okay are you doing this he goes no we
 

3063
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:52,550
okay are you doing this he goes no we
just do the simple thing this answers

3064
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:52,560
just do the simple thing this answers
 

3065
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,829
just do the simple thing this answers
the question I can't tell you what that

3066
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:53,839
the question I can't tell you what that
 

3067
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:57,189
the question I can't tell you what that
is well the deepseek paper came out

3068
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:57,199
is well the deepseek paper came out
 

3069
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,950
is well the deepseek paper came out
which told us what that was and

3070
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
which told us what that was and
 

3071
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,030
which told us what that was and
demonstrated working at scale so people

3072
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:01,040
demonstrated working at scale so people
 

3073
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,550
demonstrated working at scale so people
some speculation but then the Deep Seek

3074
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:02,560
some speculation but then the Deep Seek
 

3075
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,590
some speculation but then the Deep Seek
paper kind of nailed it for everybody.

3076
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:05,600
paper kind of nailed it for everybody.
 

3077
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,510
paper kind of nailed it for everybody.
So what people did a little bit of

3078
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:07,520
So what people did a little bit of
 

3079
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,390
So what people did a little bit of
history is useful. People

3080
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:10,400
history is useful. People
 

3081
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,070
history is useful. People
said that you could do this RLVR

3082
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:12,080
said that you could do this RLVR
 

3083
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,510
said that you could do this RLVR
technique which is reinforcement

3084
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:13,520
technique which is reinforcement
 

3085
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,630
technique which is reinforcement
learning with verifiable words. I'll

3086
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:14,640
learning with verifiable words. I'll
 

3087
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,229
learning with verifiable words. I'll
explain what that is later to make

3088
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:16,239
explain what that is later to make
 

3089
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,390
explain what that is later to make
things better at solving problems. Um

3090
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:18,400
things better at solving problems. Um
 

3091
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,709
things better at solving problems. Um
the key was to have problems that had

3092
01:10:20,709 --> 01:10:20,719
the key was to have problems that had
 

3093
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,110
the key was to have problems that had
verifiable answers and to practice on

3094
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:23,120
verifiable answers and to practice on
 

3095
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,669
verifiable answers and to practice on
them like math problems and coding

3096
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:25,679
them like math problems and coding
 

3097
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,430
them like math problems and coding
problems

3098
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,440
problems
 

3099
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,709
problems
where you could tell the answer was

3100
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:28,719
where you could tell the answer was
 

3101
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:31,669
where you could tell the answer was
right. Um

3102
01:10:31,669 --> 01:10:31,679
right. Um
 

3103
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:34,310
right. Um
but when people did this uh a very

3104
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,320
but when people did this uh a very
 

3105
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,430
but when people did this uh a very
important question emerged right and

3106
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:37,440
important question emerged right and
 

3107
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,790
important question emerged right and
very important parts like how you think

3108
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:38,800
very important parts like how you think
 

3109
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,950
very important parts like how you think
about it. So it was that there's

3110
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:40,960
about it. So it was that there's
 

3111
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,470
about it. So it was that there's
actually two different dimensions to

3112
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:42,480
actually two different dimensions to
 

3113
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,390
actually two different dimensions to
this.

3114
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:44,400
this.
 

3115
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,790
this.
First is

3116
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:46,800
First is
 

3117
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,790
First is
you have to be willing to spend more

3118
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:48,800
you have to be willing to spend more
 

3119
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,830
you have to be willing to spend more
compute while answering.

3120
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:51,840
compute while answering.
 

3121
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,430
compute while answering.
Okay, that was already present in

3122
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:53,440
Okay, that was already present in
 

3123
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,510
Okay, that was already present in
hindsight in chain of thought where you

3124
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:55,520
hindsight in chain of thought where you
 

3125
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,189
hindsight in chain of thought where you
asked the model not to give the answer

3126
01:10:57,189 --> 01:10:57,199
asked the model not to give the answer
 

3127
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,950
asked the model not to give the answer
immediately but to think it out. So

3128
01:10:58,950 --> 01:10:58,960
immediately but to think it out. So
 

3129
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,110
immediately but to think it out. So
you're spending more compute generating

3130
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,120
you're spending more compute generating
 

3131
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,790
you're spending more compute generating
these tokens of chain of thought and

3132
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:02,800
these tokens of chain of thought and
 

3133
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,430
these tokens of chain of thought and
then reading the answer. So this became

3134
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:05,440
then reading the answer. So this became
 

3135
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,590
then reading the answer. So this became
more one very important times. This is

3136
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:07,600
more one very important times. This is
 

3137
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,990
more one very important times. This is
called test time. Compute scaling is the

3138
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:10,000
called test time. Compute scaling is the
 

3139
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,510
called test time. Compute scaling is the
name people use for this.

3140
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:13,520
name people use for this.
 

3141
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:20,630
name people use for this.
Just uh write that out

3142
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:20,640

 

3143
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,990

test time compute.

3144
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,000

 

3145
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,709

And the other is given that you're

3146
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:28,719
And the other is given that you're
 

3147
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,229
And the other is given that you're
willing to spend more compute while

3148
01:11:30,229 --> 01:11:30,239
willing to spend more compute while
 

3149
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:33,030
willing to spend more compute while
answering do this test and compute. How

3150
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,040
answering do this test and compute. How
 

3151
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,070
answering do this test and compute. How
do you train the model to be better at

3152
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:36,080
do you train the model to be better at
 

3153
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,149
do you train the model to be better at
using this?

3154
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:38,159
using this?
 

3155
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:41,030
using this?
Okay. And the RLVR is about this part.

3156
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,040
Okay. And the RLVR is about this part.
 

3157
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,830
Okay. And the RLVR is about this part.
But this is also a very key ingredient.

3158
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:43,840
But this is also a very key ingredient.
 

3159
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,229
But this is also a very key ingredient.
So intellectually

3160
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:46,239
So intellectually
 

3161
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:49,350
So intellectually
uh a question emerged which was how much

3162
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
uh a question emerged which was how much
 

3163
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,790
uh a question emerged which was how much
of the gains are coming from this part

3164
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:52,800
of the gains are coming from this part
 

3165
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,990
of the gains are coming from this part
by itself and how many are how much is

3166
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:56,000
by itself and how many are how much is
 

3167
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,229
by itself and how many are how much is
coming from this part. You see that like

3168
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:58,239
coming from this part. You see that like
 

3169
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,630
coming from this part. You see that like
it's important to know and whether

3170
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:00,640
it's important to know and whether
 

3171
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,229
it's important to know and whether
there's a way of playing with this

3172
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:02,239
there's a way of playing with this
 

3173
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:05,350
there's a way of playing with this
bounds.

3174
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:05,360

 

3175
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,750

So let's think about just test time

3176
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:07,760
So let's think about just test time
 

3177
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,390
So let's think about just test time
compute a bit first, right? And I'm

3178
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:10,400
compute a bit first, right? And I'm
 

3179
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,750
compute a bit first, right? And I'm
actually probably not even going to get

3180
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:11,760
actually probably not even going to get
 

3181
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,149
actually probably not even going to get
to in this lecture the RLVR part, which

3182
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:14,159
to in this lecture the RLVR part, which
 

3183
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,310
to in this lecture the RLVR part, which
is fine. Um, but I want to kind of spend

3184
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:16,320
is fine. Um, but I want to kind of spend
 

3185
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,669
is fine. Um, but I want to kind of spend
a little bit more time on the test time

3186
01:12:17,669 --> 01:12:17,679
a little bit more time on the test time
 

3187
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,550
a little bit more time on the test time
compute. It was already mentioned. So

3188
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:20,560
compute. It was already mentioned. So
 

3189
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,149
compute. It was already mentioned. So
um, just want to recap some of it and

3190
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:22,159
um, just want to recap some of it and
 

3191
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:24,630
um, just want to recap some of it and
kind of go beyond.

3192
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:24,640
kind of go beyond.
 

3193
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,310
kind of go beyond.
The oldest approach is just pure

3194
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:26,320
The oldest approach is just pure
 

3195
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,149
The oldest approach is just pure
prompting. You know, this classic chain

3196
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:28,159
prompting. You know, this classic chain
 

3197
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,070
prompting. You know, this classic chain
of thought. You add think step by step,

3198
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:30,080
of thought. You add think step by step,
 

3199
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,149
of thought. You add think step by step,
be careful, stuff like this. Check your

3200
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:32,159
be careful, stuff like this. Check your
 

3201
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:33,830
be careful, stuff like this. Check your
answers. just things that make it

3202
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:33,840
answers. just things that make it
 

3203
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,990
answers. just things that make it
generate more tokens.

3204
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:36,000
generate more tokens.
 

3205
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,550
generate more tokens.
Okay, good. Next,

3206
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,560
Okay, good. Next,
 

3207
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,910
Okay, good. Next,
next simplest approach says

3208
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:43,920
next simplest approach says
 

3209
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,630
next simplest approach says
don't solve the problem once,

3210
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:46,640
don't solve the problem once,
 

3211
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,990
don't solve the problem once,
right? Solve the problem n times. So

3212
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:50,000
right? Solve the problem n times. So
 

3213
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,310
right? Solve the problem n times. So
just run many many many many

3214
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:52,320
just run many many many many
 

3215
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,950
just run many many many many
generations.

3216
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:54,960
generations.
 

3217
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,550
generations.
Okay. So there's a problem that I want

3218
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
Okay. So there's a problem that I want
 

3219
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,830
Okay. So there's a problem that I want
to recognize here with uh making many

3220
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:01,840
to recognize here with uh making many
 

3221
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,830
to recognize here with uh making many
many many generations which is

3222
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:05,840
many many generations which is
 

3223
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,430
many many generations which is
if you're evaluating how well can the

3224
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:07,440
if you're evaluating how well can the
 

3225
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,830
if you're evaluating how well can the
model solve the problem

3226
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:09,840
model solve the problem
 

3227
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,390
model solve the problem
uh if you do many generations and you

3228
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:12,400
uh if you do many generations and you
 

3229
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,110
uh if you do many generations and you
know the right answer you can ask how

3230
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:15,120
know the right answer you can ask how
 

3231
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,550
know the right answer you can ask how
many of those generations got the right

3232
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:16,560
many of those generations got the right
 

3233
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,270
many of those generations got the right
answer. Does everyone see that?

3234
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:19,280
answer. Does everyone see that?
 

3235
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,709
answer. Does everyone see that?
And so that's certainly you can do that

3236
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:20,719
And so that's certainly you can do that
 

3237
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:22,870
And so that's certainly you can do that
if I know the right answer. But there's

3238
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:22,880
if I know the right answer. But there's
 

3239
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,110
if I know the right answer. But there's
also the problem of if I'm going to use

3240
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:25,120
also the problem of if I'm going to use
 

3241
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,830
also the problem of if I'm going to use
the model at inference time when I don't

3242
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
the model at inference time when I don't
 

3243
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,550
the model at inference time when I don't
know the right answer, if I generate it

3244
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:30,560
know the right answer, if I generate it
 

3245
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,950
know the right answer, if I generate it
a thousand times,

3246
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:32,960
a thousand times,
 

3247
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,510
a thousand times,
what do I actually give to the user?

3248
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:35,520
what do I actually give to the user?
 

3249
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,950
what do I actually give to the user?
Does everyone see this? Or what do I

3250
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:36,960
Does everyone see this? Or what do I
 

3251
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,510
Does everyone see this? Or what do I
actually use?

3252
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:39,520
actually use?
 

3253
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,149
actually use?
Okay, so there's a difference here

3254
01:13:42,149 --> 01:13:42,159
Okay, so there's a difference here
 

3255
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:43,430
Okay, so there's a difference here
between at training when I know the

3256
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:43,440
between at training when I know the
 

3257
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,149
between at training when I know the
right answer, I can grade all of those n

3258
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:46,159
right answer, I can grade all of those n
 

3259
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:47,590
right answer, I can grade all of those n
and I can ask the question, were any of

3260
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:47,600
and I can ask the question, were any of
 

3261
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,510
and I can ask the question, were any of
them right? um and at inference time we

3262
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:51,520
them right? um and at inference time we
 

3263
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,270
them right? um and at inference time we
have to give some answer. So if the

3264
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:55,280
have to give some answer. So if the
 

3265
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,310
have to give some answer. So if the
answer so for this thing there's a

3266
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:58,320
answer so for this thing there's a
 

3267
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,030
answer so for this thing there's a
couple of choices that one can do. I'm I

3268
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,040
couple of choices that one can do. I'm I
 

3269
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,950
couple of choices that one can do. I'm I
want to note those down

3270
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:04,960

 

3271
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:13,990

at inference time.

3272
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,000

 

3273
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,350

One is

3274
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360

 

3275
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:30,310

I can take majority vote.

3276
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:30,320

 

3277
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,790

So for certain kinds of questions like

3278
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:32,800
So for certain kinds of questions like
 

3279
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,189
So for certain kinds of questions like
multiple choice or where there's a

3280
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:35,199
multiple choice or where there's a
 

3281
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,189
multiple choice or where there's a
numerical answer that's in a very small

3282
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:37,199
numerical answer that's in a very small
 

3283
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,590
numerical answer that's in a very small
set, I can just say, well, I have n

3284
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:39,600
set, I can just say, well, I have n
 

3285
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,270
set, I can just say, well, I have n
generations.

3286
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:41,280
generations.
 

3287
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,990
generations.
What did the crowd want? majority, you

3288
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:44,000
What did the crowd want? majority, you
 

3289
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,830
What did the crowd want? majority, you
know, does everyone see that? I'll pick

3290
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
know, does everyone see that? I'll pick
 

3291
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:51,350
know, does everyone see that? I'll pick
that one. That's a way of resolving it.

3292
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:51,360

 

3293
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,669

So, okay, that that's one thing. Uh

3294
01:14:55,669 --> 01:14:55,679
So, okay, that that's one thing. Uh
 

3295
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,350
So, okay, that that's one thing. Uh
there modifications thereof. There's

3296
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:57,360
there modifications thereof. There's
 

3297
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,110
there modifications thereof. There's
many modifications of this that people

3298
01:14:59,110 --> 01:14:59,120
many modifications of this that people
 

3299
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,470
many modifications of this that people
do. Um I can only touch the surface. You

3300
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:02,480
do. Um I can only touch the surface. You
 

3301
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,990
do. Um I can only touch the surface. You
can talk you can see people talking

3302
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,000
can talk you can see people talking
 

3303
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,189
can talk you can see people talking
about how they use different LLMs to

3304
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:07,199
about how they use different LLMs to
 

3305
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,070
about how they use different LLMs to
rate the generations and critique them

3306
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:10,080
rate the generations and critique them
 

3307
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,070
rate the generations and critique them
and then take majority vote. So, if I

3308
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:12,080
and then take majority vote. So, if I
 

3309
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,189
and then take majority vote. So, if I
can't If if I want to create a story,

3310
01:15:15,189 --> 01:15:15,199
can't If if I want to create a story,
 

3311
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:18,070
can't If if I want to create a story,
okay, and I want to say pick the best

3312
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,080
okay, and I want to say pick the best
 

3313
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,350
okay, and I want to say pick the best
story, I can't take majority vote. Every

3314
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:21,360
story, I can't take majority vote. Every
 

3315
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,229
story, I can't take majority vote. Every
story is different. What can I do? I

3316
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:24,239
story is different. What can I do? I
 

3317
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:28,470
story is different. What can I do? I
could ask an LLM to rate the stories

3318
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:28,480
could ask an LLM to rate the stories
 

3319
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,870
could ask an LLM to rate the stories
and then choose the one that had the

3320
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:30,880
and then choose the one that had the
 

3321
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,870
and then choose the one that had the
highest rating. Do you see that? So,

3322
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:32,880
highest rating. Do you see that? So,
 

3323
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,070
highest rating. Do you see that? So,
I've turned a problem of I can't have a

3324
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,080
I've turned a problem of I can't have a
 

3325
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,270
I've turned a problem of I can't have a
majority into add a greater and then

3326
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
majority into add a greater and then
 

3327
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,510
majority into add a greater and then
take the majority over the graders.

3328
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:41,520
take the majority over the graders.
 

3329
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,709
take the majority over the graders.
Okay? Okay, so people have all kinds of

3330
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:42,719
Okay? Okay, so people have all kinds of
 

3331
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,270
Okay? Okay, so people have all kinds of
tricks that they do um to to do this

3332
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:45,280
tricks that they do um to to do this
 

3333
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,750
tricks that they do um to to do this
very useful in practice large set. Then

3334
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:47,760
very useful in practice large set. Then
 

3335
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,110
very useful in practice large set. Then
you can have well maybe I could make

3336
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:49,120
you can have well maybe I could make
 

3337
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,189
you can have well maybe I could make
them discuss with each other. So I have

3338
01:15:51,189 --> 01:15:51,199
them discuss with each other. So I have
 

3339
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,350
them discuss with each other. So I have
graders talking to graders over and over

3340
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:53,360
graders talking to graders over and over
 

3341
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,669
graders talking to graders over and over
again and building consensus and then

3342
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:55,679
again and building consensus and then
 

3343
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,110
again and building consensus and then
choosing the response that's the highest

3344
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:57,120
choosing the response that's the highest
 

3345
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,870
choosing the response that's the highest
consensus. Then I have I do this and

3346
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:58,880
consensus. Then I have I do this and
 

3347
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,950
consensus. Then I have I do this and
then I feed that back and say make a

3348
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:00,960
then I feed that back and say make a
 

3349
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,030
then I feed that back and say make a
better one based on this. Lots and lots

3350
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:03,040
better one based on this. Lots and lots
 

3351
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,630
better one based on this. Lots and lots
of prompt engineering here that can be

3352
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:04,640
of prompt engineering here that can be
 

3353
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,910
of prompt engineering here that can be
done. But just you should be aware of

3354
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:05,920
done. But just you should be aware of
 

3355
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,189
done. But just you should be aware of
it. All of this is in the category of

3356
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
it. All of this is in the category of
 

3357
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:10,149
it. All of this is in the category of
test time compute.

3358
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:10,159
test time compute.
 

3359
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:13,110
test time compute.
But from a mathy point of view, there's

3360
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:13,120
But from a mathy point of view, there's
 

3361
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,070
But from a mathy point of view, there's
another thing you can do

3362
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
another thing you can do
 

3363
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,790
another thing you can do
and this is related uh to what you guys

3364
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:18,800
and this is related uh to what you guys
 

3365
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,470
and this is related uh to what you guys
saw with this beam search idea. Okay, I

3366
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:22,480
saw with this beam search idea. Okay, I
 

3367
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,669
saw with this beam search idea. Okay, I
you saw it in discussion. I want to

3368
01:16:23,669 --> 01:16:23,679
you saw it in discussion. I want to
 

3369
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,189
you saw it in discussion. I want to
recap it here. Um

3370
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:27,199
recap it here. Um
 

3371
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:30,070
recap it here. Um
the LM isn't just generating these

3372
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:30,080
the LM isn't just generating these
 

3373
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,870
the LM isn't just generating these
sequences, it's also evaluating their

3374
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:32,880
sequences, it's also evaluating their
 

3375
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,270
sequences, it's also evaluating their
probability for you,

3376
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:35,280
probability for you,
 

3377
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,110
probability for you,
right? because it's sampled according.

3378
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:37,120
right? because it's sampled according.
 

3379
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,110
right? because it's sampled according.
So you know the actual probability it

3380
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,120
So you know the actual probability it
 

3381
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,510
So you know the actual probability it
assigned to that sequence.

3382
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
assigned to that sequence.
 

3383
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,870
assigned to that sequence.
So you could instead of taking the

3384
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:42,880
So you could instead of taking the
 

3385
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,550
So you could instead of taking the
majority or plurality vote you could

3386
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,560
majority or plurality vote you could
 

3387
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,310
majority or plurality vote you could
just choose the highest probability one.

3388
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:48,320
just choose the highest probability one.
 

3389
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,870
just choose the highest probability one.
You see that I do a thousand

3390
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:50,880
You see that I do a thousand
 

3391
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,709
You see that I do a thousand
generations. I see as a sequence which

3392
01:16:54,709 --> 01:16:54,719
generations. I see as a sequence which
 

3393
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:55,830
generations. I see as a sequence which
is the one that had the highest

3394
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:55,840
is the one that had the highest
 

3395
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,470
is the one that had the highest
probability

3396
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:58,480
probability
 

3397
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,550
probability
and say maybe that's the one you like

3398
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:00,560
and say maybe that's the one you like
 

3399
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,470
and say maybe that's the one you like
the best.

3400
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:02,480
the best.
 

3401
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:19,350
the best.
See that? Okay.

3402
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:19,360

 

3403
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,910

So

3404
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,920
So
 

3405
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,070
So
once you think about this idea of taking

3406
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:24,080
once you think about this idea of taking
 

3407
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,470
once you think about this idea of taking
the highest probability there becomes

3408
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:26,480
the highest probability there becomes
 

3409
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:31,189
the highest probability there becomes
this question of maybe I can sample from

3410
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:31,199
this question of maybe I can sample from
 

3411
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,510
this question of maybe I can sample from
the distribution that the LM is

3412
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:33,520
the distribution that the LM is
 

3413
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,630
the distribution that the LM is
generating in a different way.

3414
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:36,640
generating in a different way.
 

3415
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,149
generating in a different way.
This can be thought of as a way of doing

3416
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:38,159
This can be thought of as a way of doing
 

3417
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:39,510
This can be thought of as a way of doing
a different different distribution

3418
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:39,520
a different different distribution
 

3419
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,510
a different different distribution
different sampling right? So instead of

3420
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:41,520
different sampling right? So instead of
 

3421
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,229
different sampling right? So instead of
just sampling I sample a thousand times

3422
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:44,239
just sampling I sample a thousand times
 

3423
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,790
just sampling I sample a thousand times
and I pick the highest probability one.

3424
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:46,800
and I pick the highest probability one.
 

3425
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,870
and I pick the highest probability one.
But maybe there's other approaches like

3426
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:48,880
But maybe there's other approaches like
 

3427
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,669
But maybe there's other approaches like
that. Yeah.

3428
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:49,679
that. Yeah.
 

3429
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:50,790
that. Yeah.

3431
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,390

01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:54,320
mean as a sequence you go through and
 

3435
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,229
mean as a sequence you go through and
you look at the probability of the next

3436
01:17:56,229 --> 01:17:56,239
you look at the probability of the next
 

3437
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:57,430
you look at the probability of the next

01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:57,440
as you march through and then like you
 

3439
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,030
as you march through and then like you
add them all together or

01:17:59,030 --> 01:17:59,040
add them all together or
 

3441
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,709

01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:02,080
probability. I say remember this thing
 

3445
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,669
probability. I say remember this thing
is generating basically a conditional

3446
01:18:03,669 --> 01:18:03,679
is generating basically a conditional
 

3447
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,430
is generating basically a conditional
probability distribution. It says at

3448
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:05,440
probability distribution. It says at
 

3449
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,110
probability distribution. It says at
every step what's the probability of the

3450
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,120
every step what's the probability of the
 

3451
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,070
every step what's the probability of the
next token given all the previous tokens

3452
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
next token given all the previous tokens
 

3453
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,110
next token given all the previous tokens
and then I sample from that

3454
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:11,120
and then I sample from that
 

3455
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,470
and then I sample from that
distribution. Then I compute again

3456
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:12,480
distribution. Then I compute again
 

3457
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,830
distribution. Then I compute again
what's the probability of the next token

3458
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:13,840
what's the probability of the next token
 

3459
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,590
what's the probability of the next token
given all the previous tokens. Sample

3460
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:15,600
given all the previous tokens. Sample
 

3461
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,110
given all the previous tokens. Sample
from that. So I'm generating the

3462
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:17,120
from that. So I'm generating the
 

3463
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,310
from that. So I'm generating the
sequence of probabilities. I can

3464
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:18,320
sequence of probabilities. I can
 

3465
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,430
sequence of probabilities. I can
multiply them together or I can take the

3466
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:19,440
multiply them together or I can take the
 

3467
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,709
multiply them together or I can take the
log and add them together. Same thing.

3468
01:18:22,709 --> 01:18:22,719
log and add them together. Same thing.
 

3469
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,550
log and add them together. Same thing.
So I can just pick the one that's the

3470
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:24,560
So I can just pick the one that's the
 

3471
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,350
So I can just pick the one that's the
highest probability.

3472
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:27,360
highest probability.
 

3473
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,910
highest probability.
It's like it's a kind of majority vote

3474
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:29,920
It's like it's a kind of majority vote
 

3475
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,590
It's like it's a kind of majority vote
style thing except it's acting on the

3476
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:31,600
style thing except it's acting on the
 

3477
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,510
style thing except it's acting on the
probability and it's saying that the

3478
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:33,520
probability and it's saying that the
 

3479
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,070
probability and it's saying that the
model probabilities are also a kind of

3480
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:36,080
model probabilities are also a kind of
 

3481
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,229
model probabilities are also a kind of
grade.

3482
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:38,239
grade.
 

3483
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:39,910
grade.
Okay.

3484
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:39,920
Okay.
 

3485
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,630
Okay.
So this became interesting because

3486
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:42,640
So this became interesting because
 

3487
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,750
So this became interesting because
people observed that when you did RL

3488
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:45,760
people observed that when you did RL
 

3489
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,990
people observed that when you did RL
post training on the model, they made

3490
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,000
post training on the model, they made
 

3491
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,229
post training on the model, they made
this interesting observation. You do RL

3492
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:50,239
this interesting observation. You do RL
 

3493
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:51,910
this interesting observation. You do RL
post training on the model to make it

3494
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:51,920
post training on the model to make it
 

3495
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,550
post training on the model to make it
generate better things. And they asked,

3496
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:54,560
generate better things. And they asked,
 

3497
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,630
generate better things. And they asked,
let me ask the original model what the

3498
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:56,640
let me ask the original model what the
 

3499
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,110
let me ask the original model what the
probabilities are for the generations

3500
01:18:59,110 --> 01:18:59,120
probabilities are for the generations
 

3501
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,149
probabilities are for the generations
out of the RL post-trained model.

3502
01:19:02,149 --> 01:19:02,159
out of the RL post-trained model.
 

3503
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:05,669
out of the RL post-trained model.
And people observed that actually the

3504
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:05,679
And people observed that actually the
 

3505
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,510
And people observed that actually the
generations from an RL post-trained

3506
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,520
generations from an RL post-trained
 

3507
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,470
generations from an RL post-trained
model seem to be among the higher

3508
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:10,480
model seem to be among the higher
 

3509
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,630
model seem to be among the higher
probability sequences

3510
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:12,640
probability sequences
 

3511
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,630
probability sequences
of the original model. They rate they

3512
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:14,640
of the original model. They rate they
 

3513
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,149
of the original model. They rate they
rate higher. They're distributionally

3514
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:16,159
rate higher. They're distributionally
 

3515
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,510
rate higher. They're distributionally
different than just sampling from the

3516
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:17,520
different than just sampling from the
 

3517
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,709
different than just sampling from the
original. It's as though the RL post

3518
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:20,719
original. It's as though the RL post
 

3519
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,830
original. It's as though the RL post
training is moving probability around

3520
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:23,840
training is moving probability around
 

3521
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,110
training is moving probability around
which it clearly is. That's all you're

3522
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:25,120
which it clearly is. That's all you're
 

3523
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,390
which it clearly is. That's all you're
doing in training is moving probability

3524
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:26,400
doing in training is moving probability
 

3525
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,590
doing in training is moving probability
around. So it's moving probability

3526
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:27,600
around. So it's moving probability
 

3527
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,790
around. So it's moving probability
around towards places that already had

3528
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:30,800
around towards places that already had
 

3529
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,350
around towards places that already had
higher probability.

3530
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:33,360
higher probability.
 

3531
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,270
higher probability.
So this is philosophically interesting

3532
01:19:37,270 --> 01:19:37,280
So this is philosophically interesting
 

3533
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,110
So this is philosophically interesting
because there's this big open question

3534
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:39,120
because there's this big open question
 

3535
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:41,430
because there's this big open question
of can you in uh post training get

01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,350
talk about the way one does RLVR and
RLHF u one of the things that people do

3574
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:21,360
RLHF u one of the things that people do
 

3575
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,550
RLHF u one of the things that people do
during training is they put a KL

3576
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:22,560
during training is they put a KL
 

3577
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,070
during training is they put a KL
divergence regularizer that makes your

3578
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:24,080
divergence regularizer that makes your
 

3579
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,229
divergence regularizer that makes your
probabilities not move very far. So one

3580
01:20:26,229 --> 01:20:26,239
probabilities not move very far. So one
 

3581
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,669
probabilities not move very far. So one
could say this is a consequence of that

3582
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:27,679
could say this is a consequence of that
 

3583
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,750
could say this is a consequence of that
regularizer. This is an active area of

3584
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:29,760
regularizer. This is an active area of
 

3585
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,430
regularizer. This is an active area of
research right now. People are very

01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:31,440
research right now. People are very
 

3587
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,709

3589
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:34,310

talking about some of the papers. So

3590
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:34,320
talking about some of the papers. So
 

3591
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,830
talking about some of the papers. So
here here's a paper that's very

01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:43,280
interesting October 16th. Okay. So
 

3595
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,709

3615
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,709
models We're actually sampling higher
higher probability spaces distribution

3616
01:21:14,709 --> 01:21:14,719
higher probability spaces distribution
 

3617
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:17,430
higher probability spaces distribution
parts of the space.

3618
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:17,440
parts of the space.
 

3619
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:21,270
parts of the space.
Okay, so here's the thinking intuition.

3620
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:21,280
Okay, so here's the thinking intuition.
 

3621
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,270
Okay, so here's the thinking intuition.
You want a good answer that includes

3622
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:23,280
You want a good answer that includes
 

3623
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,990
You want a good answer that includes
some thinking.

3624
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:26,000
some thinking.
 

3625
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,270
some thinking.
If you're sampling from the original

3626
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,280
If you're sampling from the original
 

3627
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,030
If you're sampling from the original
model that you're trained on, what can

3628
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:29,040
model that you're trained on, what can
 

3629
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,110
model that you're trained on, what can
go wrong? Remember, auto reggressive

3630
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,120
go wrong? Remember, auto reggressive
 

3631
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,830
go wrong? Remember, auto reggressive
generation moves step by step forward.

3632
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:33,840
generation moves step by step forward.
 

3633
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,709
generation moves step by step forward.
Okay, so as it moves step by step

3634
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:36,719
Okay, so as it moves step by step
 

3635
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:40,229
Okay, so as it moves step by step
forward, it could choose something that

3636
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:40,239
forward, it could choose something that
 

3637
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,870
forward, it could choose something that
was the wrong step.

3638
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:42,880
was the wrong step.
 

3639
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,750
was the wrong step.
Okay, it makes a mistake, right? Could

3640
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:45,760
Okay, it makes a mistake, right? Could
 

3641
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,189
Okay, it makes a mistake, right? Could
just be by randomness, right? Sampling

3642
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:47,199
just be by randomness, right? Sampling
 

3643
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,110
just be by randomness, right? Sampling
with some temperatures. This is the most

3644
01:21:49,110 --> 01:21:49,120
with some temperatures. This is the most
 

3645
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,630
with some temperatures. This is the most
likely thing here is four. I'm just

3646
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:50,640
likely thing here is four. I'm just
 

3647
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,470
likely thing here is four. I'm just
going to say three, but now it's

3648
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:52,480
going to say three, but now it's
 

3649
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,990
going to say three, but now it's
committed. Three is in the context,

3650
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
committed. Three is in the context,
 

3651
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,629
committed. Three is in the context,
right? So it has to like keep going. So

3652
01:21:56,629 --> 01:21:56,639
right? So it has to like keep going. So
 

3653
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,870
right? So it has to like keep going. So
one thing that people observed is that

3654
01:21:58,870 --> 01:21:58,880
one thing that people observed is that
 

3655
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,910
one thing that people observed is that
if you make a mistake after the mistake

3656
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:01,920
if you make a mistake after the mistake
 

3657
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,270
if you make a mistake after the mistake
the model might flounder it's like ah

3658
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:05,280
the model might flounder it's like ah
 

3659
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,510
the model might flounder it's like ah
you know I don't know what to do right

3660
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:07,520
you know I don't know what to do right
 

3661
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,149
you know I don't know what to do right
and so that manifests sometimes as whole

3662
01:22:10,149 --> 01:22:10,159
and so that manifests sometimes as whole
 

3663
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,229
and so that manifests sometimes as whole
bunches of tokens that are all low

3664
01:22:12,229 --> 01:22:12,239
bunches of tokens that are all low
 

3665
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:15,030
bunches of tokens that are all low
probability

3666
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,040
probability
 

3667
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,110
probability
so when you saw a beam search you saw a

3668
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:17,120
so when you saw a beam search you saw a
 

3669
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,629
so when you saw a beam search you saw a
one way of kind of getting around that

3670
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:18,639
one way of kind of getting around that
 

3671
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:20,470
one way of kind of getting around that
is to say look I'm going to keep doing

3672
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:20,480
is to say look I'm going to keep doing
 

3673
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,709
is to say look I'm going to keep doing
the generations but then I will pick

3674
01:22:22,709 --> 01:22:22,719
the generations but then I will pick
 

3675
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:26,629
the generations but then I will pick
higher likelihood sequences

3676
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639

 

3677
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:28,550

So

3678
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:28,560
So
 

3679
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:33,510
So
that's the older approach and

3680
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:33,520
that's the older approach and
 

3681
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,830
that's the older approach and
the point of it is to sample not from

3682
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:35,840
the point of it is to sample not from
 

3683
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,669
the point of it is to sample not from
the original sequences original

3684
01:22:37,669 --> 01:22:37,679
the original sequences original
 

3685
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:38,950
the original sequences original
distribution but sample

3686
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:38,960
distribution but sample
 

3687
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,390
distribution but sample
disproportionately from the higher

3688
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:40,400
disproportionately from the higher
 

3689
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,470
disproportionately from the higher
likelihood sequences. That's what beam

3690
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,480
likelihood sequences. That's what beam
 

3691
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,390
likelihood sequences. That's what beam
search is trying to do. That's what best

3692
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:44,400
search is trying to do. That's what best
 

3693
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,990
search is trying to do. That's what best
of n is trying to do if you do this

3694
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:46,000
of n is trying to do if you do this
 

3695
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,149
of n is trying to do if you do this
highest probability. The question is are

3696
01:22:48,149 --> 01:22:48,159
highest probability. The question is are
 

3697
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:50,870
highest probability. The question is are
there other ways of doing this? And the

3698
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:50,880
there other ways of doing this? And the
 

3699
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,390
there other ways of doing this? And the
answer is yeah there is. And one way of

3700
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:54,400
answer is yeah there is. And one way of
 

3701
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,910
answer is yeah there is. And one way of
doing this is to say

3702
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:57,920
doing this is to say
 

3703
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,669
doing this is to say
instead of sampling from the original

3704
01:22:59,669 --> 01:22:59,679
instead of sampling from the original
 

3705
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,830
instead of sampling from the original
distribution, I'll sample from the

3706
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:01,840
distribution, I'll sample from the
 

3707
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:06,470
distribution, I'll sample from the
distribution raised to the power four.

3708
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:06,480
distribution raised to the power four.
 

3709
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,790
distribution raised to the power four.
Okay? Why? Probabilities are numbers

3710
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
Okay? Why? Probabilities are numbers
 

3711
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,110
Okay? Why? Probabilities are numbers
between 0 and one. If you raise them to

3712
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:11,120
between 0 and one. If you raise them to
 

3713
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,229
between 0 and one. If you raise them to
a power, you shrink them.

3714
01:23:14,229 --> 01:23:14,239
a power, you shrink them.
 

3715
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,510
a power, you shrink them.
And so bigger numbers will survive

3716
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:17,520
And so bigger numbers will survive
 

3717
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,310
And so bigger numbers will survive
longer than small numbers when being

3718
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
longer than small numbers when being
 

3719
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,310
longer than small numbers when being
exponentiated being raised multiplied by

3720
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:22,320
exponentiated being raised multiplied by
 

3721
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,510
exponentiated being raised multiplied by
each other over and over again. So by

3722
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:25,520
each other over and over again. So by
 

3723
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,470
each other over and over again. So by
raising a probability to a power I'm

3724
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:28,480
raising a probability to a power I'm
 

3725
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,950
raising a probability to a power I'm
favoring higher probability and I'm

3726
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:30,960
favoring higher probability and I'm
 

3727
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,470
favoring higher probability and I'm
disfavoring lower probability.

3728
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:34,480
disfavoring lower probability.
 

3729
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,390
disfavoring lower probability.
This is also a very important thing

3730
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:36,400
This is also a very important thing
 

3731
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,390
This is also a very important thing
connected in probability to something

3732
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:38,400
connected in probability to something
 

3733
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,870
connected in probability to something
called tilting of distributions.

3734
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:40,880
called tilting of distributions.
 

3735
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,790
called tilting of distributions.
Okay. So in probability if you want to

3736
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:42,800
Okay. So in probability if you want to
 

3737
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,070
Okay. So in probability if you want to
sample from a distribution you can also

3738
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:44,080
sample from a distribution you can also
 

3739
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,430
sample from a distribution you can also
sample from a tilted distribution. This

3740
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:45,440
sample from a tilted distribution. This
 

3741
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,510
sample from a tilted distribution. This
is related to temperature. That all

3742
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:47,520
is related to temperature. That all
 

3743
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,510
is related to temperature. That all
these ideas are connected to each other.

3744
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:49,520
these ideas are connected to each other.
 

3745
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,110
these ideas are connected to each other.
Um although I'm not sure you've seen

3746
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:51,120
Um although I'm not sure you've seen
 

3747
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,030
Um although I'm not sure you've seen
tilting of distributions in your

3748
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
tilting of distributions in your
 

3749
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,790
tilting of distributions in your
previous classes. Has anyone seen

3750
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:54,800
previous classes. Has anyone seen
 

3751
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,990
previous classes. Has anyone seen
tilting of distributions in your

3752
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:56,000
tilting of distributions in your
 

3753
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,470
tilting of distributions in your
previous classes? No. They come from the

3754
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,480
previous classes? No. They come from the
 

3755
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,709
previous classes? No. They come from the
natural if you do a kalebased

3756
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:00,719
natural if you do a kalebased
 

3757
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,350
natural if you do a kalebased
regularization or penalty term and then

3758
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:03,360
regularization or penalty term and then
 

3759
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,270
regularization or penalty term and then
do lrange multipliers you will see

3760
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:05,280
do lrange multipliers you will see
 

3761
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:08,470
do lrange multipliers you will see
tilting emerge naturally as the thing

3762
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:08,480
tilting emerge naturally as the thing
 

3763
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,149
tilting emerge naturally as the thing
that happens. But that's one way you can

3764
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:10,159
that happens. But that's one way you can
 

3765
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:11,270
that happens. But that's one way you can
see it.

3766
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:11,280
see it.
 

3767
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,470
see it.
This is sometimes done in information

3768
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:12,480
This is sometimes done in information
 

3769
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,510
This is sometimes done in information
theory classes. Um, but all you need to

3770
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:15,520
theory classes. Um, but all you need to
 

3771
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,030
theory classes. Um, but all you need to
know here is that raising something to a

3772
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:17,040
know here is that raising something to a
 

3773
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,990
know here is that raising something to a
power weighs up high probability and

3774
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,000
power weighs up high probability and
 

3775
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,629
power weighs up high probability and
weighs down low probability.

3776
01:24:24,629 --> 01:24:24,639

 

3777
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:26,870

So there's a question which is in the

3778
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:26,880
So there's a question which is in the
 

3779
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,629
So there's a question which is in the
paper and I'm running out of time. Is is

3780
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:28,639
paper and I'm running out of time. Is is
 

3781
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,470
paper and I'm running out of time. Is is
this just like low temperature sampling?

3782
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:30,480
this just like low temperature sampling?
 

3783
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,070
this just like low temperature sampling?
So low temperature sampling is

3784
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:32,080
So low temperature sampling is
 

3785
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,310
So low temperature sampling is
effectively raising the probability for

3786
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:34,320
effectively raising the probability for
 

3787
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,070
effectively raising the probability for
a given token to a power.

3788
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:38,080
a given token to a power.
 

3789
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,750
a given token to a power.
Remember the temperature is like a one

3790
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:39,760
Remember the temperature is like a one
 

3791
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,470
Remember the temperature is like a one
over term. Um

3792
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:42,480
over term. Um
 

3793
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,590
over term. Um
but what you care is not individual

3794
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:45,600
but what you care is not individual
 

3795
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,110
but what you care is not individual
tokens, it's the sequences.

3796
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:49,120
tokens, it's the sequences.
 

3797
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,830
tokens, it's the sequences.
Okay. So I don't have I'm out of time.

3798
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:51,840
Okay. So I don't have I'm out of time.
 

3799
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,510
Okay. So I don't have I'm out of time.
It's fine. I will continue this. Uh

3800
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:55,520
It's fine. I will continue this. Uh
 

3801
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,270
It's fine. I will continue this. Uh
what they find in the paper is that you

3802
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:57,280
what they find in the paper is that you
 

3803
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,750
what they find in the paper is that you
can use other techniques associated with

3804
01:24:59,750 --> 01:24:59,760
can use other techniques associated with
 

3805
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,430
can use other techniques associated with
something that's called um marov chain

3806
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:03,440
something that's called um marov chain
 

3807
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:07,350
something that's called um marov chain
Monte Carlo. Okay, which allows you to

3808
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:07,360
Monte Carlo. Okay, which allows you to
 

3809
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,430
Monte Carlo. Okay, which allows you to
sample from a distribution you don't

3810
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:09,440
sample from a distribution you don't
 

3811
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,950
sample from a distribution you don't
have access to. It's also useful from a

3812
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:10,960
have access to. It's also useful from a
 

3813
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,830
have access to. It's also useful from a
teaching point of view because it

3814
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:11,840
teaching point of view because it
 

3815
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,750
teaching point of view because it
introduces ideas that I'm going to I'm

3816
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:13,760
introduces ideas that I'm going to I'm
 

3817
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,669
introduces ideas that I'm going to I'm
going to find useful um related to

3818
01:25:15,669 --> 01:25:15,679
going to find useful um related to
 

3819
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:19,189
going to find useful um related to
important sampling. But what it does is

3820
01:25:19,189 --> 01:25:19,199
important sampling. But what it does is
 

3821
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,510
important sampling. But what it does is
it's another technique that lets you say

3822
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:21,520
it's another technique that lets you say
 

3823
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,990
it's another technique that lets you say
if I can't sample from a distri if I

3824
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:24,000
if I can't sample from a distri if I
 

3825
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,750
if I can't sample from a distri if I
only have access not to the distribution

3826
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:25,760
only have access not to the distribution
 

3827
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,189
only have access not to the distribution
I want but to something that's

3828
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:27,199
I want but to something that's
 

3829
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:29,350
I want but to something that's
proportional to it raising to a power I

3830
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
proportional to it raising to a power I
 

3831
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,870
proportional to it raising to a power I
have you have to do the normalization.

3832
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:30,880
have you have to do the normalization.
 

3833
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:31,750
have you have to do the normalization.
So that's why you don't have the

3834
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:31,760
So that's why you don't have the
 

3835
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,430
So that's why you don't have the
distribution.

3836
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:33,440
distribution.
 

3837
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,470
distribution.
Then can I take lots of samples of some

3838
01:25:36,470 --> 01:25:36,480
Then can I take lots of samples of some
 

3839
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:37,830
Then can I take lots of samples of some
other distribution that's not the

3840
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:37,840
other distribution that's not the
 

3841
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,310
other distribution that's not the
distribution I want and get approximate

3842
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:40,320
distribution I want and get approximate
 

3843
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,669
distribution I want and get approximate
samples from the distribution that I

3844
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:41,679
samples from the distribution that I
 

3845
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:43,510
samples from the distribution that I
actually want.

3846
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:43,520
actually want.
 

3847
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,669
actually want.
This is another kind of test time

3848
01:25:45,669 --> 01:25:45,679
This is another kind of test time
 

3849
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:47,750
This is another kind of test time
compute. And what they find this paper

3850
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:47,760
compute. And what they find this paper
 

3851
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,830
compute. And what they find this paper
I'll assume just just to end on

3852
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:49,840
I'll assume just just to end on
 

3853
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,189
I'll assume just just to end on
something is they did an experiment

3854
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:53,199
something is they did an experiment
 

3855
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,910
something is they did an experiment
where they said on certain benchmarks

3856
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:55,920
where they said on certain benchmarks
 

3857
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,830
where they said on certain benchmarks
they took quen

3858
01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:57,840
they took quen
 

3859
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,950
they took quen
and they said base model is this and you

3860
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:00,960
and they said base model is this and you
 

3861
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,149
and they said base model is this and you
do deepseeek style training on it GRPO

3862
01:26:04,149 --> 01:26:04,159
do deepseeek style training on it GRPO
 

3863
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,830
do deepseeek style training on it GRPO
and you get to 78.5 on this benchmark.

3864
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:07,840
and you get to 78.5 on this benchmark.
 

3865
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,910
and you get to 78.5 on this benchmark.
You just do sampling raising to the

3866
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:09,920
You just do sampling raising to the
 

3867
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,229
You just do sampling raising to the
power four in some approximate way that

3868
01:26:14,229 --> 01:26:14,239
power four in some approximate way that
 

3869
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:17,110
power four in some approximate way that
already boosts your accuracy close.

3870
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:17,120
already boosts your accuracy close.
 

3871
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,229
already boosts your accuracy close.
No, no training at all. Same thing on a

that weren't trained for, there's this

3878
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:27,440
that weren't trained for, there's this
 

3879
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,990
that weren't trained for, there's this
transferability of RL knowledge that no

01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:30,000
transferability of RL knowledge that no
 

3881
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,709
transferability of RL knowledge that no
one cares about RL tuning for math. They

care about that transferring to other
things. this also transfers and
