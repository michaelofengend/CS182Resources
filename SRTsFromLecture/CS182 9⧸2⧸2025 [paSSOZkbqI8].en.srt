you to install on your machine. We'll
 

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,550
you to install on your machine. We'll
also have a link uh hopefully there that

00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
also have a link uh hopefully there that
 

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,990
also have a link uh hopefully there that
you can use to download in case you

34
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
you can use to download in case you
 

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,350
you can use to download in case you
haven't already. You should have a

36
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
haven't already. You should have a
 

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,869
haven't already. You should have a
functioning uh Anaconda environment on

38
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
functioning uh Anaconda environment on
 

39
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,229
functioning uh Anaconda environment on
your laptop so you can do do work on it.

40
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
your laptop so you can do do work on it.
 

41
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,309
your laptop so you can do do work on it.
Uh you can also use collab but you have

42
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
Uh you can also use collab but you have
 

43
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,229
Uh you can also use collab but you have
to figure out um that on your own

44
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
to figure out um that on your own
 

45
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,110
to figure out um that on your own
possibly. The

46
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
possibly. The
 

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,270
possibly. The
important thing is the discussion we'll

48
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
important thing is the discussion we'll
 

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,949
important thing is the discussion we'll
build on we talk about in lecture. this

50
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
build on we talk about in lecture. this
 

51
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,070
build on we talk about in lecture. this
will generally be the case and if there

52
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
will generally be the case and if there
 

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,030
will generally be the case and if there
isn't room in the discussion given the

54
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
isn't room in the discussion given the
 

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,949
isn't room in the discussion given the
number of students and approximately 500

56
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
number of students and approximately 500
 

57
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,949

students who want to take the class and
 

59
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,309
students who want to take the class and
the number of seats in those rooms um if

60
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
the number of seats in those rooms um if
 

61
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,149
the number of seats in those rooms um if
you're there and the room is full you

62
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
you're there and the room is full you
 

63
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,390
you're there and the room is full you
can't get in you know we're very sorry

64
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
can't get in you know we're very sorry
 

65
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,910
can't get in you know we're very sorry
sorry uh but we will post the entire

66
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
sorry uh but we will post the entire
 

67
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,910
sorry uh but we will post the entire
worksheet on ed afterwards so you can

68
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
worksheet on ed afterwards so you can
 

69
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,670
worksheet on ed afterwards so you can
see it as and the code will already have

70
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
see it as and the code will already have
 

71
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,430
see it as and the code will already have
been posted

72
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
been posted
 

73
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,030
been posted
so discussions are interactive in this

74
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
so discussions are interactive in this
 

75
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,190
so discussions are interactive in this
course. We expect you to go work with

76
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
course. We expect you to go work with
 

77
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,509
course. We expect you to go work with
others and be doing that. This is not a

78
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
others and be doing that. This is not a
 

79
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,430
others and be doing that. This is not a
sit back and relax kind of discussion.

80
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:53,440
sit back and relax kind of discussion.
 

81
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,789
sit back and relax kind of discussion.
If that's your idea of what a good

82
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
If that's your idea of what a good
 

83
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,270
If that's your idea of what a good
discussion is, just skip, you know,

84
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
discussion is, just skip, you know,
 

85
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,910
discussion is, just skip, you know,
don't go. Um, give your seat to someone

86
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
don't go. Um, give your seat to someone
 

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,509
don't go. Um, give your seat to someone
else. Uh, important other announcement

88
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
else. Uh, important other announcement
 

89
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,149
else. Uh, important other announcement
is it looks quite likely that we will be

90
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
is it looks quite likely that we will be
 

91
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,470
is it looks quite likely that we will be
able to expand the class. So, if you

92
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,480
able to expand the class. So, if you
 

93
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,869
able to expand the class. So, if you
want to get in, remember you have to do

94
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
want to get in, remember you have to do
 

95
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,390
want to get in, remember you have to do
homework zero. And

96
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
homework zero. And
 

97
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,910
homework zero. And
>> and even if you're already in

98
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
>> and even if you're already in
 

99
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,509
>> and even if you're already in
>> Yeah. Even if you you're in, you have to

100
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
>> Yeah. Even if you you're in, you have to
 

101
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,509
>> Yeah. Even if you you're in, you have to
do homework zero or you'll be dropped.

102
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
do homework zero or you'll be dropped.
 

103
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,789
do homework zero or you'll be dropped.
So this is extremely important. But uh

104
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
So this is extremely important. But uh
 

105
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,350
So this is extremely important. But uh
we have uh

106
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
we have uh
 

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,150
we have uh
keeping our fingers crossed that hey if

108
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
keeping our fingers crossed that hey if
 

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,070
keeping our fingers crossed that hey if
we hope to be able to let everyone in

110
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
we hope to be able to let everyone in
 

111
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,310
we hope to be able to let everyone in
who has does homework zero successfully

112
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
who has does homework zero successfully
 

113
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,590
who has does homework zero successfully
who actually feels like you know they

114
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
who actually feels like you know they
 

115
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,430
who actually feels like you know they
want to be in the class. And for those

116
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
want to be in the class. And for those
 

117
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,950
want to be in the class. And for those
of you if you're, you know, if you're

118
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
of you if you're, you know, if you're
 

119
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,550
of you if you're, you know, if you're
waiting outside the room three to four

120
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
waiting outside the room three to four
 

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,870
waiting outside the room three to four
and somehow you can't get into the room,

122
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
and somehow you can't get into the room,
 

123
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,189
and somehow you can't get into the room,
what I highly recommend doing is those

124
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
what I highly recommend doing is those
 

125
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,710
what I highly recommend doing is those
of you who are standing outside the

126
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
of you who are standing outside the
 

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,590
of you who are standing outside the
room, don't just leave. Everyone who's

128
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
room, don't just leave. Everyone who's
 

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,469
room, don't just leave. Everyone who's
standing outside the room, get together

130
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
standing outside the room, get together
 

131
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,950
standing outside the room, get together
and say, "Okay, let's together work on

132
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
and say, "Okay, let's together work on
 

133
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,909
and say, "Okay, let's together work on
this discussion worksheet." Uh there,

134
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
this discussion worksheet." Uh there,
 

135
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,350
this discussion worksheet." Uh there,
you know, you you'll have a you'll have

136
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
you know, you you'll have a you'll have
 

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,870
you know, you you'll have a you'll have
a critical mass of people. Let's say you

138
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
a critical mass of people. Let's say you
 

139
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,510
a critical mass of people. Let's say you
can't get into the room. Use the time,

140
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
can't get into the room. Use the time,
 

141
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,150
can't get into the room. Use the time,
use the time to make connections because

142
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
use the time to make connections because
 

143
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,870
use the time to make connections because
that is what is needed to you know

144
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
that is what is needed to you know
 

145
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,510
that is what is needed to you know
succeed in this machine learning deep

146
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
succeed in this machine learning deep
 

147
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,510

learning world is that you will have to
 

149
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,350
learning world is that you will have to
be selfarters. So this is in some sense

150
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
be selfarters. So this is in some sense
 

151
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,590
be selfarters. So this is in some sense
a simulation of the real world before

a simulation of the real world before
 

153
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,950
a simulation of the real world before
you graduate. It's uh so use that. Yes.

154
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
you graduate. It's uh so use that. Yes.
 

155
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,710
you graduate. It's uh so use that. Yes.

>> Will there be extra sheets printed for
people who are going to stand outside or

158
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
people who are going to stand outside or
 

159
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,909
people who are going to stand outside or
who may not get in?

who may not get in?
 

161
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,230
who may not get in?
>> Yeah,

162
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
>> Yeah,
 

163
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,230
>> Yeah,
>> we can try to make that happen. We will

>> we can try to make that happen. We will
 

165
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,670
>> we can try to make that happen. We will
try our best. That's a great idea. And

166
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
try our best. That's a great idea. And
 

167
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,430
try our best. That's a great idea. And
so yes, we will support that by making

168
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
so yes, we will support that by making
 

169
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,990
so yes, we will support that by making
sure that we can try to keep a stack of

170
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
sure that we can try to keep a stack of
 

171
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,950
sure that we can try to keep a stack of
sheets outside the room. But even if we

172
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
sheets outside the room. But even if we
 

173
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,870
sheets outside the room. But even if we
somehow fail at that, it will be posted

174
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
somehow fail at that, it will be posted
 

175
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,550
somehow fail at that, it will be posted
on ED so you can just download it and

176
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
on ED so you can just download it and
 

177
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,029
on ED so you can just download it and
and do it even if somehow but that's a

178
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
and do it even if somehow but that's a
 

179
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,230
and do it even if somehow but that's a
great suggestion and we will do our best

180
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
great suggestion and we will do our best
 

181
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,070
great suggestion and we will do our best
to have extra sheets so that you know

182
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
to have extra sheets so that you know
 

183
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,950
to have extra sheets so that you know
you can just work on your own. In

184
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
you can just work on your own. In
 

185
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,550
you can just work on your own. In
typical week once we're in steady state,

186
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
typical week once we're in steady state,
 

187
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,830
typical week once we're in steady state,
we'll be posting on to ED only after the

188
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:53,840
we'll be posting on to ED only after the
 

189
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,550
we'll be posting on to ED only after the
discussions have completed uh because we

190
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
discussions have completed uh because we
 

191
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,230
discussions have completed uh because we
know how many students have very bad

192
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
know how many students have very bad
 

193
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,550
know how many students have very bad
habits and so it's important for people

194
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
habits and so it's important for people
 

195
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,950
habits and so it's important for people
to go.

196
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
to go.
 

197
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,350
to go.
>> But this week we'll because of the

>> But this week we'll because of the
 

199
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,469
>> But this week we'll because of the
enormous difference between the number

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
You're expected to go take notes.
 

217
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,950
You're expected to go take notes.
>> Yes.

218
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
>> Yes.
 

219
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,189

>> Yes, we will t typically post discussion
solutions uh afterwards.

224
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080

 

225
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,230

Okay, good. So let's uh continue with

226
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
Okay, good. So let's uh continue with
 

227
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,550
Okay, good. So let's uh continue with
the material. So last time at the end

228
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
the material. So last time at the end
 

229
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,390
the material. So last time at the end
we're talking about thinking about you

230
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
we're talking about thinking about you
 

231
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,670
we're talking about thinking about you
know building up the idea of neural nets

232
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
know building up the idea of neural nets
 

233
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,629
know building up the idea of neural nets
from the perspective of function

234
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
from the perspective of function
 

235
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,029
from the perspective of function
approximation. So this is just a quick

236
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
approximation. So this is just a quick
 

237
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,189
approximation. So this is just a quick
you know recap of where we were. So I

238
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
you know recap of where we were. So I
 

239
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,430
you know recap of where we were. So I
remember I drew a function on the board

240
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
remember I drew a function on the board
 

241
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,990
remember I drew a function on the board
saying consider a function easiest one

242
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
saying consider a function easiest one
 

243
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,230
saying consider a function easiest one
to visualize our functions of one

244
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
to visualize our functions of one
 

245
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,270
to visualize our functions of one
variable that have exactly one output.

246
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
variable that have exactly one output.
 

247
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,510
variable that have exactly one output.
So R is to R. So you can draw them on

248
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
So R is to R. So you can draw them on
 

249
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,629
So R is to R. So you can draw them on
the board. So here we've drawn it. And

250
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
the board. So here we've drawn it. And
 

251
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,710
the board. So here we've drawn it. And
now the machine learning problem is that

252
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
now the machine learning problem is that
 

253
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,029
now the machine learning problem is that
there's a true function but you don't

254
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
there's a true function but you don't
 

255
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,950
there's a true function but you don't
know it. What you have is samples. So

256
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
know it. What you have is samples. So
 

257
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,029
know it. What you have is samples. So
here we've just labeled in red.

258
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
here we've just labeled in red.
 

259
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,589
here we've just labeled in red.
Oops.

260
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599

 

261
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,670

You can see here these little x's. These

262
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
You can see here these little x's. These
 

263
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,430
You can see here these little x's. These
are the x's that you have in your

264
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
are the x's that you have in your
 

265
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,230
are the x's that you have in your
training data. And the corresponding y's

266
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
training data. And the corresponding y's
 

267
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,990
training data. And the corresponding y's
I've just labeled here. So this is a

268
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000
I've just labeled here. So this is a
 

269
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,110
I've just labeled here. So this is a
pair an xy pair.

270
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
pair an xy pair.
 

271
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,110
pair an xy pair.
Uh so you have all of these. And what

272
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
Uh so you have all of these. And what
 

273
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,110
Uh so you have all of these. And what
you're trying to do is you're trying to

274
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
you're trying to do is you're trying to
 

275
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,670
you're trying to do is you're trying to
from these samples learn what the

276
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
from these samples learn what the
 

277
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,029
from these samples learn what the
function is. This is like a way of

278
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
function is. This is like a way of
 

279
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,790
function is. This is like a way of
visualizing what's happening. Discussion

280
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
visualizing what's happening. Discussion
 

281
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,550
visualizing what's happening. Discussion
will be going over this with code for

282
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
will be going over this with code for
 

283
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,710
will be going over this with code for
you.

284
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
you.
 

285
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,790
you.
Okay. So now last time we talked about

286
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
Okay. So now last time we talked about
 

287
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,070
Okay. So now last time we talked about
the idea of you know you can approximate

288
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
the idea of you know you can approximate
 

289
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,589
the idea of you know you can approximate
it with something. So you can

290
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
it with something. So you can
 

291
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,270
it with something. So you can
approximate a peiewise linear

292
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
approximate a peiewise linear
 

293
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,869
approximate a peiewise linear
approximation.

294
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
approximation.
 

295
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,230
approximation.
So you see here in

296
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240

 

297
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,589

in this blue there's a particular

298
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
in this blue there's a particular
 

299
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,350
in this blue there's a particular
peacewise linear uh function

300
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
peacewise linear uh function
 

301
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,270
peacewise linear uh function
approximation that is drawn. Not a

302
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
approximation that is drawn. Not a
 

303
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,550
approximation that is drawn. Not a
particularly good one. You see all kinds

304
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
particularly good one. You see all kinds
 

305
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,909
particularly good one. You see all kinds
of kinks and things that are not

306
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
of kinks and things that are not
 

307
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,469
of kinks and things that are not
tracking the true function. But notice

308
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
tracking the true function. But notice
 

309
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,869
tracking the true function. But notice
that this peacewise linear approximation

310
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
that this peacewise linear approximation
 

311
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,589
that this peacewise linear approximation
that's drawn, the second blue one here,

312
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
that's drawn, the second blue one here,
 

313
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,430
that's drawn, the second blue one here,
it does go through all of the training

314
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
it does go through all of the training
 

315
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,670
it does go through all of the training
points. So notice it goes through all of

316
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
points. So notice it goes through all of
 

317
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,629
points. So notice it goes through all of
the red points. Okay, this is a generic

318
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
the red points. Okay, this is a generic
 

319
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,790
the red points. Okay, this is a generic
thing that can happen.

320
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,800
thing that can happen.
 

321
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,070
thing that can happen.
Um, there's another one, the

322
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
Um, there's another one, the
 

323
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,709
Um, there's another one, the
other blue one you can see that also

324
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
other blue one you can see that also
 

325
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,630
other blue one you can see that also
hits all the training points and somehow

326
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:36,640
hits all the training points and somehow
 

327
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,709
hits all the training points and somehow
feels a little bit better. So, this is

328
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
feels a little bit better. So, this is
 

329
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,389
feels a little bit better. So, this is
just meant to remind you of things that

330
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
just meant to remind you of things that
 

331
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,589
just meant to remind you of things that
you've already seen. But the focus where

332
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
you've already seen. But the focus where
 

333
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,550
you've already seen. But the focus where
we were going last time was to say that

334
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
we were going last time was to say that
 

335
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,990
we were going last time was to say that
you have such a peace-wise linear

336
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
you have such a peace-wise linear
 

337
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,829
you have such a peace-wise linear
function. You would like to

338
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
function. You would like to
 

339
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,230
function. You would like to
learn it from data. An intermediate step

340
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
learn it from data. An intermediate step
 

341
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,829
learn it from data. An intermediate step
that's very important is you have to

342
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
that's very important is you have to
 

343
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,990
that's very important is you have to
represent that function somehow on the

344
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
represent that function somehow on the
 

345
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,150
represent that function somehow on the
computer. And so you have to understand

346
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
computer. And so you have to understand
 

347
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,269
computer. And so you have to understand
what does it take to represent the

348
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
what does it take to represent the
 

349
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,870
what does it take to represent the
function you want. So in this case we

350
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
function you want. So in this case we
 

351
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,870
function you want. So in this case we
said that this peacewise linear

352
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
said that this peacewise linear
 

353
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,710
said that this peacewise linear
functions are specified by these elbow

354
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
functions are specified by these elbow
 

355
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,990
functions are specified by these elbow
locations, the slopes and an overall

356
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
locations, the slopes and an overall
 

357
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,470
locations, the slopes and an overall
vertical bias.

358
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
vertical bias.
 

359
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,269
vertical bias.
So to

360
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
So to
 

361
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,949
So to
parameterize that for the computer we

362
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
parameterize that for the computer we
 

363
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,870
parameterize that for the computer we
have to pick some linear algebraic

364
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
have to pick some linear algebraic
 

365
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,269
have to pick some linear algebraic
friendly representation of that. So we

366
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
friendly representation of that. So we
 

367
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,590
friendly representation of that. So we
started with this last time and last

368
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
started with this last time and last
 

369
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,110
started with this last time and last
time we got to saying that if we write

370
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
time we got to saying that if we write
 

371
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,670
time we got to saying that if we write
this as the representation for the

372
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
this as the representation for the
 

373
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,389
this as the representation for the
function where the g theta is described

374
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
function where the g theta is described
 

375
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,389
function where the g theta is described
this way

376
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
this way
 

377
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,990
this way
where the g theta individually looks

378
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
where the g theta individually looks
 

379
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,470
where the g theta individually looks
like this. It's a function that has one

380
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
like this. It's a function that has one
 

381
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,949
like this. It's a function that has one
kink in it. Then if you add up a

382
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
kink in it. Then if you add up a
 

383
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,030
kink in it. Then if you add up a
function shifted with lot with one kink,

384
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
function shifted with lot with one kink,
 

385
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,070
function shifted with lot with one kink,
you can get a function with as many

386
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
you can get a function with as many
 

387
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,750
you can get a function with as many
kinks as you want wherever you want

388
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
kinks as you want wherever you want
 

389
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,670
kinks as you want wherever you want
them. Okay? As long as you can move the

390
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
them. Okay? As long as you can move the
 

391
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,430
them. Okay? As long as you can move the
kinks.

392
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
kinks.
 

393
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,910
kinks.
So that's what we did last time.

394
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
So that's what we did last time.
 

395
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,269
So that's what we did last time.
Everyone cool with with this? So already

396
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
Everyone cool with with this? So already
 

397
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,350
Everyone cool with with this? So already
you know from your intuition that if I

398
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
you know from your intuition that if I
 

399
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,070
you know from your intuition that if I
choose a pie-wise linear approximation

400
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
choose a pie-wise linear approximation
 

401
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,070
choose a pie-wise linear approximation
with enough pieces, I can get as close

402
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,080
with enough pieces, I can get as close
 

403
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,790
with enough pieces, I can get as close
as I want to the function I want.

404
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
as I want to the function I want.
 

405
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,509
as I want to the function I want.
Okay. So

406
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
Okay. So
 

407
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,990
Okay. So
now

408
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
now
 

409
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,389
now
let's just draw this thing

410
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:14,399
let's just draw this thing
 

411
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,030
let's just draw this thing
in block diagram form.

412
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
in block diagram form.
 

413
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,630
in block diagram form.
So it's useful to be able to draw

414
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
So it's useful to be able to draw
 

415
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,509
So it's useful to be able to draw
diagrams. So in this case we have to

416
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
diagrams. So in this case we have to
 

417
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,110
diagrams. So in this case we have to
draw this wx plus b. So that's taking x

418
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
draw this wx plus b. So that's taking x
 

419
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,910
draw this wx plus b. So that's taking x
multiplying it by a w and then adding a

420
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
multiplying it by a w and then adding a
 

421
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,630
multiplying it by a w and then adding a
b to it. And then we have to run it

422
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640
b to it. And then we have to run it
 

423
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,790
b to it. And then we have to run it
through this max with zero. So the max

424
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
through this max with zero. So the max
 

425
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,430
through this max with zero. So the max
with zero is called a rail loop. Right?

426
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
with zero is called a rail loop. Right?
 

427
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,949
with zero is called a rail loop. Right?
So it's literally the function that's

428
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
So it's literally the function that's
 

429
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,389
So it's literally the function that's
max of zero and whatever its input is.

430
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
max of zero and whatever its input is.
 

431
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,870
max of zero and whatever its input is.
It's called rectifying linear unit. It's

432
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
It's called rectifying linear unit. It's
 

433
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,470
It's called rectifying linear unit. It's
one of the most simple simplest

434
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
one of the most simple simplest
 

435
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,310
one of the most simple simplest
nonlinearities you have. Has lots of

436
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
nonlinearities you have. Has lots of
 

437
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,069
nonlinearities you have. Has lots of
nice interesting features which will be

438
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
nice interesting features which will be
 

439
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,310
nice interesting features which will be
talk about later. But

440
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
talk about later. But
 

441
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,069
talk about later. But
now in neural network terminology which

442
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
now in neural network terminology which
 

443
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,069
now in neural network terminology which
we expect everyone to have seen but

444
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:54,079
we expect everyone to have seen but
 

445
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,350
we expect everyone to have seen but
maybe the terminology you saw was

446
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
maybe the terminology you saw was
 

447
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,150
maybe the terminology you saw was
different. So I want to make sure

448
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
different. So I want to make sure
 

449
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,509
different. So I want to make sure
everyone's aligned to standard some

450
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
everyone's aligned to standard some
 

451
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,590
everyone's aligned to standard some
standard terminology. These are these

452
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
standard terminology. These are these
 

453
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,110
standard terminology. These are these
nonlinearities are sometimes called

454
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
nonlinearities are sometimes called
 

455
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,350
nonlinearities are sometimes called
activation functions.

456
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
activation functions.
 

457
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,949
activation functions.
It's just a term. It has no

458
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
It's just a term. It has no
 

459
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,590
It's just a term. It has no
just a just a word.

460
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
just a just a word.
 

461
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,150
just a just a word.
So if we put this stuff together this

462
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
So if we put this stuff together this
 

463
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,750
So if we put this stuff together this
math here together as math

464
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
math here together as math
 

465
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,670
math here together as math
we can just expand out these g thetas

466
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
we can just expand out these g thetas
 

467
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,910
we can just expand out these g thetas
and you see

468
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
and you see
 

469
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,509
and you see
an expression like this. So here is

470
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
an expression like this. So here is
 

471
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,110
an expression like this. So here is
another piece of notation that we want

472
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
another piece of notation that we want
 

473
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,630
another piece of notation that we want
to make sure everyone is is familiar

474
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
to make sure everyone is is familiar
 

475
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,790
to make sure everyone is is familiar
with. And the piece of notation here is

476
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
with. And the piece of notation here is
 

477
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,870
with. And the piece of notation here is
that

478
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
that
 

479
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,230
that
when we have a nonlinearity, we

480
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
when we have a nonlinearity, we
 

481
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,790
when we have a nonlinearity, we
sometimes apply the nonlinearity to an

482
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
sometimes apply the nonlinearity to an
 

483
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,750
sometimes apply the nonlinearity to an
entire vector. So you take x is a scaler

484
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
entire vector. So you take x is a scaler
 

485
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,550
entire vector. So you take x is a scaler
here. So just remember this is a scaler.

486
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560

 

487
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,750

But this W, if I group together all of

488
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
But this W, if I group together all of
 

489
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,350
But this W, if I group together all of
these, if I take this sum. So notice

490
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
these, if I take this sum. So notice
 

491
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,269
these, if I take this sum. So notice
what I've done here is we've taken this

492
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
what I've done here is we've taken this
 

493
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,389
what I've done here is we've taken this
sum and we've just turned it into a

494
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
sum and we've just turned it into a
 

495
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,069
sum and we've just turned it into a
matrix

496
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
matrix
 

497
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,230
matrix
vector multiplication in this case. And

498
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
vector multiplication in this case. And
 

499
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,790
vector multiplication in this case. And
so this thing is a vector. All these

500
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
so this thing is a vector. All these
 

501
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,710
so this thing is a vector. All these
biases, these B prime I those are, you

502
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
biases, these B prime I those are, you
 

503
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,829
biases, these B prime I those are, you
know, a vector. And

504
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
know, a vector. And
 

505
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,670
know, a vector. And
when we have a nonlinearity that acts on

506
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:09,680
when we have a nonlinearity that acts on
 

507
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,269
when we have a nonlinearity that acts on
a matrix or a vector, unless we specify

508
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
a matrix or a vector, unless we specify
 

509
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,590
a matrix or a vector, unless we specify
otherwise, what that means is it acts

510
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
otherwise, what that means is it acts
 

511
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,670
otherwise, what that means is it acts
component-wise.

512
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
component-wise.
 

513
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,269
component-wise.
It's a piece of notation. So it acts on

514
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
It's a piece of notation. So it acts on
 

515
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,870
It's a piece of notation. So it acts on
every component. So notice this is a

516
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
every component. So notice this is a
 

517
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,790
every component. So notice this is a
compact representation of what you have.

518
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
compact representation of what you have.
 

519
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,069
compact representation of what you have.
Any questions on this compact

520
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
Any questions on this compact
 

521
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,670
Any questions on this compact
representation?

522
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680

 

523
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,310

Okay, good. So now

524
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320

 

525
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,310

there's a question of you know how do

526
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,320
there's a question of you know how do
 

527
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,870
there's a question of you know how do
you label these things because you have

528
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
you label these things because you have
 

529
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,069
you label these things because you have
this B over here right good here you

530
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
this B over here right good here you
 

531
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,790
this B over here right good here you
have this B over here and you have this

532
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
have this B over here and you have this
 

533
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,509
have this B over here and you have this
B over here so typically we will label

534
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
B over here so typically we will label
 

535
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,910
B over here so typically we will label
these things with which layer they

536
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
these things with which layer they
 

537
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,550
these things with which layer they
correspond to these biases so let me

538
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
correspond to these biases so let me
 

539
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,310
correspond to these biases so let me
write that in right now so let's call

540
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
write that in right now so let's call
 

541
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,990
write that in right now so let's call
this we're using these primes we might

542
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
this we're using these primes we might
 

543
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,110
this we're using these primes we might
as well interpret them as ones

544
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
as well interpret them as ones
 

545
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,110
as well interpret them as ones
Okay, so let's just uh call that one.

546
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
Okay, so let's just uh call that one.
 

547
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,629
Okay, so let's just uh call that one.
Make that prime into a one because it

548
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
Make that prime into a one because it
 

549
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,069
Make that prime into a one because it
looks like a one. And then

550
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
looks like a one. And then
 

551
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,629
looks like a one. And then
this other bias comes afterwards. So

552
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
this other bias comes afterwards. So
 

553
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,509
this other bias comes afterwards. So
this is two and this weight matrix is

554
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
this is two and this weight matrix is
 

555
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,310
this is two and this weight matrix is
also two.

556
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
also two.
 

557
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,230
also two.
Sometimes we'll specify very clearly for

558
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
Sometimes we'll specify very clearly for
 

559
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,710
Sometimes we'll specify very clearly for
you what the shapes are of things like

560
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
you what the shapes are of things like
 

561
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,470
you what the shapes are of things like
how big they are and sometimes you'll be

562
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
how big they are and sometimes you'll be
 

563
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,310
how big they are and sometimes you'll be
expected to figure it out from context.

564
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
expected to figure it out from context.
 

565
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,629
expected to figure it out from context.
So in this case the context is how big

566
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
So in this case the context is how big
 

567
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,470
So in this case the context is how big
is this sum.

568
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480

 

569
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,030

So we'll just make it up to D.

570
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040

 

571
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,990

In which case you can interpret this X

572
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
In which case you can interpret this X
 

573
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,430
In which case you can interpret this X
is a scalar

574
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440

 

575
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,910

this W as let's say since we're

576
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
this W as let's say since we're
 

577
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,790
this W as let's say since we're
premultiplying it by oops we're

578
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
premultiplying it by oops we're
 

579
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,629
premultiplying it by oops we're
premultiplying it by a matrix we should

580
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
premultiplying it by a matrix we should
 

581
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,150
premultiplying it by a matrix we should
make this into a column. So we can think

582
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
make this into a column. So we can think
 

583
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,030
make this into a column. So we can think
of this as a column. It's a column with

584
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
of this as a column. It's a column with
 

585
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,030
of this as a column. It's a column with
D entries in it. This is a matrix that

586
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
D entries in it. This is a matrix that
 

587
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,350
D entries in it. This is a matrix that
has to give a scalar output. So we'll

588
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
has to give a scalar output. So we'll
 

589
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,069
has to give a scalar output. So we'll
call it'll be a row with D entries. But

590
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
call it'll be a row with D entries. But
 

591
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,750
call it'll be a row with D entries. But
in general, keeping track of the shapes

592
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
in general, keeping track of the shapes
 

593
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,949
in general, keeping track of the shapes
of things is something that's very

594
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
of things is something that's very
 

595
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,670
of things is something that's very
important and you should be doing. It's

596
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
important and you should be doing. It's
 

597
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,710
important and you should be doing. It's
one of the baines of uh working in

598
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
one of the baines of uh working in
 

599
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,790
one of the baines of uh working in
neural networks and just have to do it

600
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
neural networks and just have to do it
 

601
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,590
neural networks and just have to do it
also in the code. Um so in the code

602
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
also in the code. Um so in the code
 

603
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,910
also in the code. Um so in the code
often we'll use this package called IGEN

604
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
often we'll use this package called IGEN
 

605
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,350
often we'll use this package called IGEN
which helps you deal with these kind of

606
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
which helps you deal with these kind of
 

607
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,269
which helps you deal with these kind of
sums and things like this but you still

608
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
sums and things like this but you still
 

609
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,470
sums and things like this but you still
have to keep track of the shapes of

610
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
have to keep track of the shapes of
 

611
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,550
have to keep track of the shapes of
everything.

612
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
everything.
 

613
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,310
everything.
Okay. So it's useful to also be able to

614
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
Okay. So it's useful to also be able to
 

615
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,470
Okay. So it's useful to also be able to
think about this thing not as symbolic

616
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
think about this thing not as symbolic
 

617
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,430
think about this thing not as symbolic
math but also as a diagram. So in block

618
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
math but also as a diagram. So in block
 

619
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,710
math but also as a diagram. So in block
diagram form putting everything together

620
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
diagram form putting everything together
 

621
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,790
diagram form putting everything together
what we have is we have x coming in

622
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:48,800
what we have is we have x coming in
 

623
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,990
what we have is we have x coming in
then it meets these uh weights and

624
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
then it meets these uh weights and
 

625
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,550
then it meets these uh weights and
biases in parallel. Notice the

626
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
biases in parallel. Notice the
 

627
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,629
biases in parallel. Notice the
parallelism is very visible goes through

628
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
parallelism is very visible goes through
 

629
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,670
parallelism is very visible goes through
relus and then we get these

630
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
relus and then we get these
 

631
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,590
relus and then we get these
intermediate activations. So what we do

632
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
intermediate activations. So what we do
 

633
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,189
intermediate activations. So what we do
is we we call this make use dotted lines

634
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
is we we call this make use dotted lines
 

635
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,550
is we we call this make use dotted lines
here. Maybe I'll use a different color.

636
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560

 

637
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,509

It's not visible what you're writing.

638
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:15,519

 

639
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,910

>> This is now okay.

640
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
>> This is now okay.
 

641
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,069
>> This is now okay.
>> So we'll call this the input layer.

642
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079

 

643
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,990

Then this

644
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000

 

645
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,910

is the

646
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
is the
 

647
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,590
is the
first hidden layer. Again, this is just

648
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
first hidden layer. Again, this is just
 

649
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,710
first hidden layer. Again, this is just
standard neural network terminology.

650
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
standard neural network terminology.
 

651
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,829
standard neural network terminology.
and the activations at the end.

652
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:39,839
and the activations at the end.
 

653
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:47,590
and the activations at the end.
These are called the activations.

654
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600

 

655
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,389

So this is activation. You hear someone

656
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
So this is activation. You hear someone
 

657
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,590
So this is activation. You hear someone
talk about the activations at a

658
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
talk about the activations at a
 

659
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,509
talk about the activations at a
particular layer. What they mean is what

660
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,519
particular layer. What they mean is what
 

661
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,949
particular layer. What they mean is what
is the output of that layer.

662
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
is the output of that layer.
 

663
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,389
is the output of that layer.
This can get confusing because sometimes

664
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
This can get confusing because sometimes
 

665
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,590
This can get confusing because sometimes
we'll have layers that are just linear

666
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
we'll have layers that are just linear
 

667
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,670
we'll have layers that are just linear
and don't have any nonlinearities. Okay,

668
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
and don't have any nonlinearities. Okay,
 

669
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,030
and don't have any nonlinearities. Okay,
but they still use this term

670
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
but they still use this term
 

671
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,590
but they still use this term
activations. So all these hes are the

672
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
activations. So all these hes are the
 

673
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,269
activations. So all these hes are the
hidden activations and then we have

674
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:11,279

 

675
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,470

all these second layer weights and

676
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
all these second layer weights and
 

677
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,870
all these second layer weights and
the second layer bias.

678
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
the second layer bias.
 

679
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,189
the second layer bias.
And in this case if it's the last layer

680
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
And in this case if it's the last layer
 

681
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,150
And in this case if it's the last layer
we typically call it the output layer.

682
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160

 

683
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:38,790

Use the same color.

684
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800

 

685
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,590

Uh typically output layers we will have

686
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
Uh typically output layers we will have
 

687
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,629
Uh typically output layers we will have
will be something that is linear aphine

688
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
will be something that is linear aphine
 

689
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,350
will be something that is linear aphine
and oftentimes we will sometimes have

690
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
and oftentimes we will sometimes have
 

691
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,110
and oftentimes we will sometimes have
things that are after the output layer

692
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
things that are after the output layer
 

693
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,269
things that are after the output layer
either in processing that are like we'll

694
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
either in processing that are like we'll
 

695
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,030
either in processing that are like we'll
some put the loss we'll call it a loss

696
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
some put the loss we'll call it a loss
 

697
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,389
some put the loss we'll call it a loss
layer sometimes we'll convert things

698
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399
layer sometimes we'll convert things
 

699
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,710
layer sometimes we'll convert things
into probabilities like softmax layers

700
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
into probabilities like softmax layers
 

701
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,150
into probabilities like softmax layers
we'll have other things we'll stick on

702
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160
we'll have other things we'll stick on
 

703
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,350
we'll have other things we'll stick on
but typically as you've seen in your uh

704
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
but typically as you've seen in your uh
 

705
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,510
but typically as you've seen in your uh
previous class you have an input you

706
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
previous class you have an input you
 

707
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,870
previous class you have an input you
have some number of layers in domain

708
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
have some number of layers in domain
 

709
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,870
have some number of layers in domain
that have involve typically some

710
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
that have involve typically some
 

711
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,429
that have involve typically some
nonlinearity and matrix vector

712
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
nonlinearity and matrix vector
 

713
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,909
nonlinearity and matrix vector
arithmetic and then you have an output

714
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
arithmetic and then you have an output
 

715
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,630
arithmetic and then you have an output
layer just typically alphine that's how

716
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
layer just typically alphine that's how
 

717
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,029
layer just typically alphine that's how
we think about deep neural nets okay

718
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,039
we think about deep neural nets okay
 

719
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,309
we think about deep neural nets okay
very basic kind of make sure everyone's

720
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
very basic kind of make sure everyone's
 

721
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,470
very basic kind of make sure everyone's
on the same page with terminology so I

722
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
on the same page with terminology so I
 

723
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,110
on the same page with terminology so I
want to do this right now in lecture to

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
want to do this right now in lecture to
 

725
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,190
want to do this right now in lecture to
set up for discussion where you will see

726
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
set up for discussion where you will see
 

727
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,870
set up for discussion where you will see
code that walks you through this

code that walks you through this
 

729
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,110
code that walks you through this
specific example and lets you visualize

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
specific example and lets you visualize
 

731
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,549
specific example and lets you visualize
what's going on in this case seeing

00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:34,559
what's going on in this case seeing
 

733
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,830
what's going on in this case seeing
what's happening and you can learn

734
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:35,840
what's happening and you can learn
 

735
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,669
what's happening and you can learn
you'll learn something from uh what

736
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
you'll learn something from uh what
 

737
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,909
you'll learn something from uh what
happens in that discussion. Okay, any

00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
happens in that discussion. Okay, any
 

739
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,669
happens in that discussion. Okay, any
questions on this before we move on to

740
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
questions on this before we move on to
 

741
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,430
questions on this before we move on to
the next topic?

742
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440

 

743
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,110

It's all very standard. Just want to

744
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
It's all very standard. Just want to
 

745
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,830
It's all very standard. Just want to
make sure everyone's on the same page.

746
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
make sure everyone's on the same page.
 

747
00:17:51,840 --> 00:18:08,150
make sure everyone's on the same page.
Okay, great. Let's move on. Okay.

748
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160

 

749
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:16,870

So, is this visible? Yes.

750
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880

 

751
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,549

Okay. Is my mic working? Everyone can

752
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:18,559
Okay. Is my mic working? Everyone can
 

753
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,350
Okay. Is my mic working? Everyone can
hear me. The recording can hear me?

754
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360

 

755
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,430

Yes. No.

756
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
Yes. No.
 

757
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,990
Yes. No.
Okay. Great. Okay. So um what I'm going

758
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
Okay. Great. Okay. So um what I'm going
 

759
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,150
Okay. Great. Okay. So um what I'm going
to do today is I'm going to talk through

760
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,160
to do today is I'm going to talk through
 

761
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,390
to do today is I'm going to talk through
some basically standard terminology. A

762
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400
some basically standard terminology. A
 

763
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,990
some basically standard terminology. A
lot of this should be familiar to you

764
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
lot of this should be familiar to you
 

765
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,029
lot of this should be familiar to you
folks and then start going into what is

766
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:39,039
folks and then start going into what is
 

767
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,350
folks and then start going into what is
going to be the focus of our attention

768
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360
going to be the focus of our attention
 

769
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,710
going to be the focus of our attention
for the you know first almost four three

770
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
for the you know first almost four three
 

771
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,830
for the you know first almost four three
four uh weeks of the class. I'm not sure

772
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
four uh weeks of the class. I'm not sure
 

773
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,669
four uh weeks of the class. I'm not sure
uh how many but uh where we're going to

774
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
uh how many but uh where we're going to
 

775
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,270
uh how many but uh where we're going to
talk about optimization and that's going

776
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
talk about optimization and that's going
 

777
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,710
talk about optimization and that's going
to be a a big thing that we're going to

778
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
to be a a big thing that we're going to
 

779
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,870
to be a a big thing that we're going to
come back to again and again. What I'm

780
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
come back to again and again. What I'm
 

781
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,870
come back to again and again. What I'm
going to be talking about today is stuff

782
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
going to be talking about today is stuff
 

783
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,590
going to be talking about today is stuff
that all of you have probably seen in

784
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
that all of you have probably seen in
 

785
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,310
that all of you have probably seen in
some form or another in either your

786
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:02,320
some form or another in either your
 

787
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,150
some form or another in either your
optimization class or your machine

788
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
optimization class or your machine
 

789
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,070
optimization class or your machine
learning class. And so it should be

790
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
learning class. And so it should be
 

791
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,710
learning class. And so it should be
quite familiar to you. What might not be

792
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
quite familiar to you. What might not be
 

793
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,470
quite familiar to you. What might not be
as familiar is the specific

794
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:10,480
as familiar is the specific
 

795
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,070
as familiar is the specific
interpretations because that's what

796
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,080
interpretations because that's what
 

797
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,750
interpretations because that's what
we're going to be uh spending a little

798
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
we're going to be uh spending a little
 

799
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,630
we're going to be uh spending a little
bit more time on in class today. So this

800
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
bit more time on in class today. So this
 

801
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,630
bit more time on in class today. So this
is a good lecture for you to try to get

802
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
is a good lecture for you to try to get
 

803
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,710
is a good lecture for you to try to get
a sense of what is the kind of work that

804
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
a sense of what is the kind of work that
 

805
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,029
a sense of what is the kind of work that
we're going to be doing in uh a bunch a

806
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
we're going to be doing in uh a bunch a
 

807
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,590
we're going to be doing in uh a bunch a
bunch of the class. Before I start, I

808
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
bunch of the class. Before I start, I
 

809
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,350
bunch of the class. Before I start, I
want to announce that we will have

810
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
want to announce that we will have
 

811
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,909
want to announce that we will have
office hours right after class in 400

812
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
office hours right after class in 400
 

813
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,310
office hours right after class in 400
Corey. It's a little bit of a funky room

814
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,320
Corey. It's a little bit of a funky room
 

815
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,630
Corey. It's a little bit of a funky room
to find, but what we will do every week

816
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
to find, but what we will do every week
 

817
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,230
to find, but what we will do every week
after lectures, we will kind of collect

818
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
after lectures, we will kind of collect
 

819
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,750
after lectures, we will kind of collect
right outside lecture. So if you want to

820
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760
right outside lecture. So if you want to
 

821
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,070
right outside lecture. So if you want to
hang out for office hours, just like

822
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
hang out for office hours, just like
 

823
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,990
hang out for office hours, just like
hang out with us and then we will walk

824
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
hang out with us and then we will walk
 

825
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,270
hang out with us and then we will walk
as a group to office hours. uh strongly

826
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
as a group to office hours. uh strongly
 

827
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,230
as a group to office hours. uh strongly
encourage you to come. So um if in case

828
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
encourage you to come. So um if in case
 

829
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,830
encourage you to come. So um if in case
you can't find it, just wait for us

830
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
you can't find it, just wait for us
 

831
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,029
you can't find it, just wait for us
right outside this room and we will

832
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
right outside this room and we will
 

833
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,870
right outside this room and we will
always walk together to the office hours

834
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
always walk together to the office hours
 

835
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,510
always walk together to the office hours
room. Okay.

836
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:55,520
room. Okay.
 

837
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,270
room. Okay.
So you've all taken the machine learning

838
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
So you've all taken the machine learning
 

839
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,190
So you've all taken the machine learning
class and within machine learning you've

840
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
class and within machine learning you've
 

841
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,990
class and within machine learning you've
seen basically two different categories

842
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
seen basically two different categories
 

843
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,750
seen basically two different categories
of problems, right? You've seen the

844
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
of problems, right? You've seen the
 

845
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,990
of problems, right? You've seen the
supervised learning style of stuff and

846
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
supervised learning style of stuff and
 

847
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,230
supervised learning style of stuff and
you've seen unsupervised learning. So in

848
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
you've seen unsupervised learning. So in
 

849
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,830
you've seen unsupervised learning. So in
supervised learning basically you have

850
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
supervised learning basically you have
 

851
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,070
supervised learning basically you have
this situation where you have these XY

852
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
this situation where you have these XY
 

853
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,110
this situation where you have these XY
pairs of data. X is whatever

854
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
pairs of data. X is whatever
 

855
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,870
pairs of data. X is whatever
characteristics or features maybe that

856
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
characteristics or features maybe that
 

857
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,990
characteristics or features maybe that
the that the data has and you can think

858
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
the that the data has and you can think
 

859
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,830
the that the data has and you can think
of it as that uh you can call it your

860
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
of it as that uh you can call it your
 

861
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,909
of it as that uh you can call it your
input, you can call it your coariant.

862
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919
input, you can call it your coariant.
 

863
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,150
input, you can call it your coariant.
This is just again terminology.

864
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,160
This is just again terminology.
 

865
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,549
This is just again terminology.
Y on the other hand is your output or

866
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:28,559
Y on the other hand is your output or
 

867
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,710
Y on the other hand is your output or
your label. So for example, you have a

868
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
your label. So for example, you have a
 

869
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,870
your label. So for example, you have a
bunch of cats and dogs and so you have

870
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:32,880
bunch of cats and dogs and so you have
 

871
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,310
bunch of cats and dogs and so you have
labels that say cat or dog. Now when you

872
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
labels that say cat or dog. Now when you
 

873
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,630
labels that say cat or dog. Now when you
think about these labels, the type of

874
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
think about these labels, the type of
 

875
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,470
think about these labels, the type of
label that you're thinking about leads

876
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
label that you're thinking about leads
 

877
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,990
label that you're thinking about leads
to different kinds of supervised

878
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
to different kinds of supervised
 

879
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,390
to different kinds of supervised
learning problems, right? If you have a

880
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
learning problems, right? If you have a
 

881
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,390
learning problems, right? If you have a
real valued output, often the kind of uh

882
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
real valued output, often the kind of uh
 

883
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,230
real valued output, often the kind of uh
machine learning model that you're doing

884
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
machine learning model that you're doing
 

885
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,070
machine learning model that you're doing
is a regression model where you're

886
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080
is a regression model where you're
 

887
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,310
is a regression model where you're
trying to fit uh something in the style

888
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
trying to fit uh something in the style
 

889
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,430
trying to fit uh something in the style
of le squares, not necessarily that. On

890
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
of le squares, not necessarily that. On
 

891
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,950
of le squares, not necessarily that. On
the other hand, if you have binary or

892
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
the other hand, if you have binary or
 

893
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,430
the other hand, if you have binary or
discrete labels, then what you're trying

894
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
discrete labels, then what you're trying
 

895
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,110
discrete labels, then what you're trying
to do is something like classification.

896
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,120
to do is something like classification.
 

897
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,710
to do is something like classification.
So the cat and dog classification

898
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
So the cat and dog classification
 

899
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,789
So the cat and dog classification
problem is um is more of that style. And

900
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
problem is um is more of that style. And
 

901
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,950
problem is um is more of that style. And
these are kind of the two classic things

902
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
these are kind of the two classic things
 

903
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,870
these are kind of the two classic things
that you look at under supervised uh

904
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880
that you look at under supervised uh
 

905
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,590
that you look at under supervised uh
learning. And here generally what we're

906
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,600
learning. And here generally what we're
 

907
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,310
learning. And here generally what we're
doing is we're saying look let's take

908
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
doing is we're saying look let's take
 

909
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,750
doing is we're saying look let's take
one specific model and train it to solve

910
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:23,760
one specific model and train it to solve
 

911
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,630
one specific model and train it to solve
one specific problem using this one

912
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
one specific problem using this one
 

913
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,950
one specific problem using this one
specific training data set that I have.

914
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:28,960
specific training data set that I have.
 

915
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,470
specific training data set that I have.
That's the paradigm that you're

916
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
That's the paradigm that you're
 

917
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,710
That's the paradigm that you're
operating in.

918
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720
operating in.
 

919
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,870
operating in.
On the other hand then you have

920
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:34,880
On the other hand then you have
 

921
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,710
On the other hand then you have
unsupervised learning right and on

922
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
unsupervised learning right and on
 

923
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,870
unsupervised learning right and on
unsupervised learning the big thing is

924
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
unsupervised learning the big thing is
 

925
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,310
unsupervised learning the big thing is
that well we don't have the wise right

926
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
that well we don't have the wise right
 

927
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,630
that well we don't have the wise right
we don't have any labels. And so what

928
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
we don't have any labels. And so what
 

929
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,070
we don't have any labels. And so what
you're trying to do is you're trying to

930
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
you're trying to do is you're trying to
 

931
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,590
you're trying to do is you're trying to
uncover

932
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
uncover
 

933
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,390
uncover
properties that are implicit in the X

934
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,400
properties that are implicit in the X
 

935
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,070
properties that are implicit in the X
data that you have. So for example, the

936
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,080
data that you have. So for example, the
 

937
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,750
data that you have. So for example, the
most standard example that probably

938
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
most standard example that probably
 

939
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,430
most standard example that probably
everyone has seen for unsupervised

940
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
everyone has seen for unsupervised
 

941
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,350
everyone has seen for unsupervised
learning is principal components

942
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
learning is principal components
 

943
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,230
learning is principal components
analysis, right? I have a bunch of data

944
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
analysis, right? I have a bunch of data
 

945
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,190
analysis, right? I have a bunch of data
and then I'm trying to recover what are

946
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
and then I'm trying to recover what are
 

947
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,950
and then I'm trying to recover what are
the most important directions or what

948
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
the most important directions or what
 

949
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,230
the most important directions or what
are the directions with the most

950
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,240
are the directions with the most
 

951
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,909
are the directions with the most
variation within this data.

952
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
variation within this data.
 

953
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,590
variation within this data.
The other kind of um unsupervised

954
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:13,600
The other kind of um unsupervised
 

955
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,350
The other kind of um unsupervised
learning that you might have is then

956
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
learning that you might have is then
 

957
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,510
learning that you might have is then
clustering. And here probably everyone's

958
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
clustering. And here probably everyone's
 

959
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,990
clustering. And here probably everyone's
seen K means as well, right? Uh in 189

960
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
seen K means as well, right? Uh in 189
 

961
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,990
seen K means as well, right? Uh in 189
you've definitely covered this. So there

962
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,000
you've definitely covered this. So there
 

963
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,310
you've definitely covered this. So there
you're trying to say this is kind of an

964
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
you're trying to say this is kind of an
 

965
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,549
you're trying to say this is kind of an
unsupervised way of thinking about

966
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:26,559
unsupervised way of thinking about
 

967
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,750
unsupervised way of thinking about
clustering, right? That's the kind of

968
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
clustering, right? That's the kind of
 

969
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,909
clustering, right? That's the kind of
unsupervised parallel. You're trying to

970
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:29,919
unsupervised parallel. You're trying to
 

971
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,710
unsupervised parallel. You're trying to
say which of these folks are like the

972
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
say which of these folks are like the
 

973
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,950
say which of these folks are like the
others and which of these folks are are

974
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
others and which of these folks are are
 

975
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,230
others and which of these folks are are
different. So you know there's a cluster

976
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240
different. So you know there's a cluster
 

977
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,669
different. So you know there's a cluster
here because these are all similar to

978
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:37,679
here because these are all similar to
 

979
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,789
here because these are all similar to
each other. There's a cluster here.

980
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
each other. There's a cluster here.
 

981
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,149
each other. There's a cluster here.
these these points are all similar to

982
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
these these points are all similar to
 

983
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,630
these these points are all similar to
each other. This is the second kind of

984
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
each other. This is the second kind of
 

985
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,710
each other. This is the second kind of
unsupervised learning problem. And then

986
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720
unsupervised learning problem. And then
 

987
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,470
unsupervised learning problem. And then
maybe the third type that you have is is

988
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,480
maybe the third type that you have is is
 

989
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,390
maybe the third type that you have is is
looking at really density estimation. So

990
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
looking at really density estimation. So
 

991
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,149
looking at really density estimation. So
saying let's say I have a bunch of data.

992
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
saying let's say I have a bunch of data.
 

993
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,710
saying let's say I have a bunch of data.
I have X1, X2, X3, X4, so on and so

994
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
I have X1, X2, X3, X4, so on and so
 

995
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,190
I have X1, X2, X3, X4, so on and so
forth. And what I'm trying to understand

996
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,200
forth. And what I'm trying to understand
 

997
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,029
forth. And what I'm trying to understand
is what is the underlying

998
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
is what is the underlying
 

999
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,669
is what is the underlying
distribution that actually captures all

1000
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:03,679
distribution that actually captures all
 

1001
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,710
distribution that actually captures all
of this data. And then you use that for

1002
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:06,720
of this data. And then you use that for
 

1003
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,830
of this data. And then you use that for
basically all kinds of different

1004
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:07,840
basically all kinds of different
 

1005
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,830
basically all kinds of different
follow-on problems. But this also falls

1006
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:09,840
follow-on problems. But this also falls
 

1007
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,230
follow-on problems. But this also falls
into a category of unsupervised

1008
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
into a category of unsupervised
 

1009
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,549
into a category of unsupervised
learning. And this is all stuff that you

1010
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
learning. And this is all stuff that you
 

1011
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,549
learning. And this is all stuff that you
should have seen before, you're familiar

1012
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
should have seen before, you're familiar
 

1013
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,310
should have seen before, you're familiar
with. We just want to kind of put that

1014
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,320
with. We just want to kind of put that
 

1015
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,510
with. We just want to kind of put that
terminology out there, make sure

1016
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
terminology out there, make sure
 

1017
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,029
terminology out there, make sure
everyone's on the same page. Do you want

1018
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
everyone's on the same page. Do you want
 

1019
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:21,830
everyone's on the same page. Do you want
to add anything?

1020
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:21,840
to add anything?
 

1021
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,430
to add anything?
>> Yeah, I just want to add one comment

1022
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
>> Yeah, I just want to add one comment
 

1023
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,310
>> Yeah, I just want to add one comment
here. Um, so for those who've taken a

1024
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
here. Um, so for those who've taken a
 

1025
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,590
here. Um, so for those who've taken a
machine learning class, we're we're

1026
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:27,600
machine learning class, we're we're
 

1027
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,350
machine learning class, we're we're
extremely confident that everyone has

1028
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
extremely confident that everyone has
 

1029
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,909
extremely confident that everyone has
seen something like PCA and everyone has

1030
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
seen something like PCA and everyone has
 

1031
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,990
seen something like PCA and everyone has
seen K means. We know that some of you

1032
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
seen K means. We know that some of you
 

1033
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,750
seen K means. We know that some of you
may or may not have seen explicit

1034
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
may or may not have seen explicit
 

1035
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,710
may or may not have seen explicit
density estimation. So we we know that.

1036
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720
density estimation. So we we know that.
 

1037
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,870
density estimation. So we we know that.
Um the other minor comment I wanted to

1038
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:40,880
Um the other minor comment I wanted to
 

1039
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,430
Um the other minor comment I wanted to
make is that what you probably

1040
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,440
make is that what you probably
 

1041
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,710
make is that what you probably
experienced in your machine learning

1042
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
experienced in your machine learning
 

1043
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,350
experienced in your machine learning
class was that these two categories felt

1044
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360
class was that these two categories felt
 

1045
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,070
class was that these two categories felt
different to you in how they were taught

1046
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
different to you in how they were taught
 

1047
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,830
different to you in how they were taught
in that you saw on this side one style

1048
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840
in that you saw on this side one style
 

1049
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,230
in that you saw on this side one style
of how things were done. Just you set

1050
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:56,240
of how things were done. Just you set
 

1051
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,590
of how things were done. Just you set
things up into some optimization

1052
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
things up into some optimization
 

1053
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,789
things up into some optimization
framework and you did some kind of

1054
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,799
framework and you did some kind of
 

1055
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,350
framework and you did some kind of
optimization thing with the exception of

1056
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
optimization thing with the exception of
 

1057
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,870
optimization thing with the exception of
one category here. where you learned

1058
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880
one category here. where you learned
 

1059
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,549
one category here. where you learned
about decision trees which felt a little

1060
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
about decision trees which felt a little
 

1061
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,110
about decision trees which felt a little
different and over here what you saw

1062
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120
different and over here what you saw
 

1063
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,630
different and over here what you saw
what might have felt like a whole bunch

1064
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
what might have felt like a whole bunch
 

1065
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,430
what might have felt like a whole bunch
of bespoke algorithms that do this

1066
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
of bespoke algorithms that do this
 

1067
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,990
of bespoke algorithms that do this
particular thing. So this is just a a

1068
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
particular thing. So this is just a a
 

1069
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,230
particular thing. So this is just a a
cultural thing you should also be aware

1070
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
cultural thing you should also be aware
 

1071
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,310
cultural thing you should also be aware
of uh that you might be familiar with.

1072
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
of uh that you might be familiar with.
 

1073
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,870
of uh that you might be familiar with.
Um this will be different when we come

1074
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:22,880
Um this will be different when we come
 

1075
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,350
Um this will be different when we come
to deep learning.

1076
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360

 

1077
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,470

>> Any questions on this? We're good.

1078
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
>> Any questions on this? We're good.
 

1079
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,870
>> Any questions on this? We're good.
Okay. So then now what are we trying to

1080
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
Okay. So then now what are we trying to
 

1081
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,149
Okay. So then now what are we trying to
think about when we think about deep

1082
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:34,159
think about when we think about deep
 

1083
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,710
think about when we think about deep
learning? Well, within deep learning, we

1084
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:36,720
learning? Well, within deep learning, we
 

1085
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,590
learning? Well, within deep learning, we
also in some sense have these two

1086
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,600
also in some sense have these two
 

1087
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,310
also in some sense have these two
categor categories, right? We have the

1088
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,320
categor categories, right? We have the
 

1089
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,950
categor categories, right? We have the
supervised and unsupervised categories.

1090
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,960
supervised and unsupervised categories.
 

1091
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,870
supervised and unsupervised categories.
And you can use a deep network to do

1092
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
And you can use a deep network to do
 

1093
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,549
And you can use a deep network to do
regression. You can use a deep network

1094
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:48,559
regression. You can use a deep network
 

1095
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,789
regression. You can use a deep network
to do classification, right? We can

1096
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:50,799
to do classification, right? We can
 

1097
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,110
to do classification, right? We can
solve classical machine learning

1098
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,120
solve classical machine learning
 

1099
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,230
solve classical machine learning
problems using deep learning techniques.

1100
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
problems using deep learning techniques.
 

1101
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,630
problems using deep learning techniques.
So that paradigm extends and

1102
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:00,640
So that paradigm extends and
 

1103
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,269
So that paradigm extends and
is a standard thing to do.

1104
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279
is a standard thing to do.
 

1105
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,350
is a standard thing to do.
What is something what is so what is a

1106
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,360
What is something what is so what is a
 

1107
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,470
What is something what is so what is a
supervised learning type of problem that

1108
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
supervised learning type of problem that
 

1109
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,870
supervised learning type of problem that
deep learning kind of unlocks that maybe

1110
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
deep learning kind of unlocks that maybe
 

1111
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,470
deep learning kind of unlocks that maybe
wasn't as studied in traditional machine

1112
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,480
wasn't as studied in traditional machine
 

1113
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,230
wasn't as studied in traditional machine
learning. So one example of that is

1114
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,240
learning. So one example of that is
 

1115
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,190
learning. So one example of that is
something like localized annotation. So

1116
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
something like localized annotation. So
 

1117
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,110
something like localized annotation. So
what do I mean by that? Let's say I have

1118
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,120
what do I mean by that? Let's say I have
 

1119
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,669
what do I mean by that? Let's say I have
an image and in this image there is a

1120
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:23,679
an image and in this image there is a
 

1121
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,789
an image and in this image there is a
cat and there's a bicycle and there's a

1122
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:26,799
cat and there's a bicycle and there's a
 

1123
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,710
cat and there's a bicycle and there's a
traffic light and there's a person

1124
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
traffic light and there's a person
 

1125
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,269
traffic light and there's a person
walking. Well, I want to basically have

1126
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
walking. Well, I want to basically have
 

1127
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,029
walking. Well, I want to basically have
okay, these are all the pixels that what

1128
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:33,039
okay, these are all the pixels that what
 

1129
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,310
okay, these are all the pixels that what
do these pixels represent? They

1130
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,320
do these pixels represent? They
 

1131
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,470
do these pixels represent? They
represent a the cat. I want to be able

1132
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
represent a the cat. I want to be able
 

1133
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,310
represent a the cat. I want to be able
to shade out what the traffic light is.

1134
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
to shade out what the traffic light is.
 

1135
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,190
to shade out what the traffic light is.
I want to be able to identify what uh

1136
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,200
I want to be able to identify what uh
 

1137
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,870
I want to be able to identify what uh
where the pedestrian is, for example.

1138
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
where the pedestrian is, for example.
 

1139
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,310
where the pedestrian is, for example.
And if you think about this for example

1140
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,320
And if you think about this for example
 

1141
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,190
And if you think about this for example
in the context of a self-driving car,

1142
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,200
in the context of a self-driving car,
 

1143
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,549
in the context of a self-driving car,
it's important to be able to do this

1144
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
it's important to be able to do this
 

1145
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,950
it's important to be able to do this
kind of semantic segmentation also with

1146
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:50,960
kind of semantic segmentation also with
 

1147
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,870
kind of semantic segmentation also with
context, right? It's one thing to say,

1148
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:52,880
context, right? It's one thing to say,
 

1149
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,310
context, right? It's one thing to say,
okay, here's an image and there's a cat

1150
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,320
okay, here's an image and there's a cat
 

1151
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,909
okay, here's an image and there's a cat
in it. It's another thing to say that

1152
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:55,919
in it. It's another thing to say that
 

1153
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,510
in it. It's another thing to say that
here's an image and there's a cat in the

1154
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
here's an image and there's a cat in the
 

1155
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,190
here's an image and there's a cat in the
middle of the road here. So doing this

1156
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,200
middle of the road here. So doing this
 

1157
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,630
middle of the road here. So doing this
kind of semantic segmentation is

1158
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
kind of semantic segmentation is
 

1159
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,870
kind of semantic segmentation is
something for example is a is a kind of

1160
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:04,880
something for example is a is a kind of
 

1161
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,789
something for example is a is a kind of
supervised learning that you can unlock

1162
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
supervised learning that you can unlock
 

1163
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,549
supervised learning that you can unlock
using uh deep learning type of

1164
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
using uh deep learning type of
 

1165
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,630
using uh deep learning type of
techniques.

1166
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:10,640
techniques.
 

1167
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,230
techniques.
Again, um there is the unsupervised

1168
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,240
Again, um there is the unsupervised
 

1169
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,789
Again, um there is the unsupervised
flavor of deep learning techniques. And

1170
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
flavor of deep learning techniques. And
 

1171
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,269
flavor of deep learning techniques. And
so here one of the most standard and uh

1172
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:19,279
so here one of the most standard and uh
 

1173
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,070
so here one of the most standard and uh
nice ones is of just learning

1174
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
nice ones is of just learning
 

1175
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,310
nice ones is of just learning
embeddings, right? So what does it mean

1176
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,320
embeddings, right? So what does it mean
 

1177
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,510
embeddings, right? So what does it mean
to learn an embedding? An embedding is

1178
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:27,520
to learn an embedding? An embedding is
 

1179
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,190
to learn an embedding? An embedding is
basically taking any kind of data and

1180
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
basically taking any kind of data and
 

1181
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,830
basically taking any kind of data and
turning it into vectors.

1182
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:33,840
turning it into vectors.
 

1183
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,789
turning it into vectors.
um the standard and most famous of this

1184
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:36,799
um the standard and most famous of this
 

1185
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,830
um the standard and most famous of this
and kind of this came from u NLP is

1186
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:39,840
and kind of this came from u NLP is
 

1187
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,830
and kind of this came from u NLP is
taking words and turning them into

1188
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:41,840
taking words and turning them into
 

1189
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,190
taking words and turning them into
vectors and so you have a vector for

1190
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,200
vectors and so you have a vector for
 

1191
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,750
vectors and so you have a vector for
every single every single word how do I

1192
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
every single every single word how do I
 

1193
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,390
every single every single word how do I
learn what vector is for what word well

1194
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
learn what vector is for what word well
 

1195
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,149
learn what vector is for what word well
that's I can think of that as a learning

1196
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:52,159
that's I can think of that as a learning
 

1197
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,549
that's I can think of that as a learning
problem that is my process of learning

1198
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:54,559
problem that is my process of learning
 

1199
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,590
problem that is my process of learning
embeddings and this is basically you

1200
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
embeddings and this is basically you
 

1201
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,990
embeddings and this is basically you
know in some sense uh similar in spirit

1202
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,000
know in some sense uh similar in spirit
 

1203
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,470
know in some sense uh similar in spirit
to the idea of principal components

1204
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,480
to the idea of principal components
 

1205
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,110
to the idea of principal components
analysis We want to say look we have all

1206
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
analysis We want to say look we have all
 

1207
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,269
analysis We want to say look we have all
this data. We want to figure out what

1208
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
this data. We want to figure out what
 

1209
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,470
this data. We want to figure out what
are the key dimensions of this problem.

1210
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
are the key dimensions of this problem.
 

1211
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,909
are the key dimensions of this problem.
I want to look at only those. I want to

1212
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
I want to look at only those. I want to
 

1213
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,990
I want to look at only those. I want to
reduce the dimensionality of my data.

1214
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,000
reduce the dimensionality of my data.
 

1215
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,470
reduce the dimensionality of my data.
Okay. So I take whatever my data set is

1216
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,480
Okay. So I take whatever my data set is
 

1217
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,390
Okay. So I take whatever my data set is
all my words or all of my numbers

1218
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:18,400
all my words or all of my numbers
 

1219
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,350
all my words or all of my numbers
whatever they are and I want to embed

1220
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
whatever they are and I want to embed
 

1221
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,710
whatever they are and I want to embed
them into a vector space into vectors so

1222
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
them into a vector space into vectors so
 

1223
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,710
them into a vector space into vectors so
that I can look at them within that

1224
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:26,720
that I can look at them within that
 

1225
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,510
that I can look at them within that
vector space of those vectors. Okay. So

1226
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520
vector space of those vectors. Okay. So
 

1227
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,350
vector space of those vectors. Okay. So
there's a similarity here to how you've

1228
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
there's a similarity here to how you've
 

1229
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,310
there's a similarity here to how you've
been thinking about PCA.

1230
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,320
been thinking about PCA.
 

1231
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,710
been thinking about PCA.
And then you know as I'm sure everyone

1232
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:36,720
And then you know as I'm sure everyone
 

1233
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,029
And then you know as I'm sure everyone
has heard that the other big thing that

1234
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:39,039
has heard that the other big thing that
 

1235
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,830
has heard that the other big thing that
you have is generative models, right? So

1236
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
you have is generative models, right? So
 

1237
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,789
you have is generative models, right? So
you want to be able to generate a

1238
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:44,799
you want to be able to generate a
 

1239
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,110
you want to be able to generate a
picture of a cat, a picture of a dog,

1240
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120
picture of a cat, a picture of a dog,
 

1241
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,909
picture of a cat, a picture of a dog,
you want to be able to generate text.

1242
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:49,919
you want to be able to generate text.
 

1243
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,909
you want to be able to generate text.
This is the big set of other kinds of uh

1244
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
This is the big set of other kinds of uh
 

1245
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,870
This is the big set of other kinds of uh
deep learning models where you have uh

1246
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:56,880
deep learning models where you have uh
 

1247
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,389
deep learning models where you have uh
the ability to basically create uh or or

1248
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:00,399
the ability to basically create uh or or
 

1249
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,710
the ability to basically create uh or or
or generate samples from a particular

1250
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:02,720
or generate samples from a particular
 

1251
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,070
or generate samples from a particular

00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,080
from a particular distribution
 

1253
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,149
from a particular distribution
essentially and from that this has a

1254
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:06,159
essentially and from that this has a
 

1255
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,630
essentially and from that this has a
parallel to what we think about as

1256
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,640
parallel to what we think about as
 

1257
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,630
parallel to what we think about as
density estimation in classical machine

1258
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:10,640

1263
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,310
know if I want to develop a model a
generative model for a cat what I'm

1264
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
generative model for a cat what I'm
 

1265
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,029
generative model for a cat what I'm
really doing is I'm saying let me look

1266
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
really doing is I'm saying let me look
 

1267
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,110
really doing is I'm saying let me look
at all of my training data and can I

1268
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,120
at all of my training data and can I
 

1269
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,190
at all of my training data and can I
develop a distribution for the pictures

1270
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,200
develop a distribution for the pictures
 

1271
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,350
develop a distribution for the pictures
of cats? And then when I want to

1272
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
of cats? And then when I want to
 

1273
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,190
of cats? And then when I want to
generate a picture of a cat, what that

1274
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:29,200
generate a picture of a cat, what that
 

1275
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,029
generate a picture of a cat, what that
really is is it's I'm trying to sample.

1276
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:31,039
really is is it's I'm trying to sample.
 

1277
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,110
really is is it's I'm trying to sample.
I'm saying take this distribution. Now

1278
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,120
I'm saying take this distribution. Now
 

1279
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,310
I'm saying take this distribution. Now
draw me a sample from my distribution on

1280
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,320
draw me a sample from my distribution on
 

1281
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,710
draw me a sample from my distribution on
cats. Right? So that's what generative

1282
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:38,720
cats. Right? So that's what generative
 

1283
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,630
cats. Right? So that's what generative
models um are trying to do. And we'll

1284
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:40,640
models um are trying to do. And we'll
 

1285
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,990
models um are trying to do. And we'll
we'll talk about this more in the class

1286
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
we'll talk about this more in the class
 

1287
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,470
we'll talk about this more in the class
as we go on.

1288
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:44,480
as we go on.
 

1289
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,310
as we go on.
And then within deep learning you have

1290
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,320
And then within deep learning you have
 

1291
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,950
And then within deep learning you have
basically the paradigm that we are now

1292
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:48,960
basically the paradigm that we are now
 

1293
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,950
basically the paradigm that we are now
that's becoming more and more important

1294
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:50,960
that's becoming more and more important
 

1295
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,110
that's becoming more and more important
which is the paradigm of foundation

1296
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,120
which is the paradigm of foundation
 

1297
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,350
which is the paradigm of foundation
models. And this idea of a foundation

1298
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
models. And this idea of a foundation
 

1299
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,669
models. And this idea of a foundation
model is this idea that you have some

1300
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:57,679
model is this idea that you have some
 

1301
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,430
model is this idea that you have some
data you've trained a model on something

1302
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
data you've trained a model on something
 

1303
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,669
data you've trained a model on something
it has learned something and then you

1304
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
it has learned something and then you
 

1305
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,870
it has learned something and then you
take that foundation model and fine-tune

1306
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
take that foundation model and fine-tune
 

1307
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,630
take that foundation model and fine-tune
it to your particular task. And this is

1308
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
it to your particular task. And this is
 

1309
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,149
it to your particular task. And this is
different from let's say how uh machine

1310
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:12,159
different from let's say how uh machine
 

1311
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,909
different from let's say how uh machine
learning has been done for a while where

1312
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:13,919
learning has been done for a while where
 

1313
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,470
learning has been done for a while where
let's say I wanted to develop a model to

1314
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,480
let's say I wanted to develop a model to
 

1315
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,909
let's say I wanted to develop a model to
predict housing prices um for you know

1316
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919
predict housing prices um for you know
 

1317
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,029
predict housing prices um for you know
give me a house and give me the

1318
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:21,039
give me a house and give me the
 

1319
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,350
give me a house and give me the
prediction for the house price well I

1320
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,360
prediction for the house price well I
 

1321
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,269
prediction for the house price well I
train a specific model for that right I

1322
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:25,279
train a specific model for that right I
 

1323
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,710
train a specific model for that right I
take in the zip code I take in the

1324
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:26,720
take in the zip code I take in the
 

1325
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,870
take in the zip code I take in the
neighborhood I take in the school

1326
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
neighborhood I take in the school
 

1327
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,470
neighborhood I take in the school
information I take in you know what the

1328
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:32,480
information I take in you know what the
 

1329
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,990
information I take in you know what the
prices of the neighboring houses so on

1330
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,000
prices of the neighboring houses so on
 

1331
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,990
prices of the neighboring houses so on
and so forth I feed this data in maybe

1332
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,000
and so forth I feed this data in maybe
 

1333
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,190
and so forth I feed this data in maybe
as some vector I train some model and

1334
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:39,200
as some vector I train some model and
 

1335
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,789
as some vector I train some model and
then I get an output. And so I'm

1336
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:40,799
then I get an output. And so I'm
 

1337
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,950
then I get an output. And so I'm
specifically training this model to

1338
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
specifically training this model to
 

1339
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,149
specifically training this model to
predict houses uh house prices. Now if I

1340
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:46,159
predict houses uh house prices. Now if I
 

1341
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,029
predict houses uh house prices. Now if I
wanted to use this model to let's say

1342
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,039
wanted to use this model to let's say
 

1343
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,110
wanted to use this model to let's say
you know predict uh the weather, that's

1344
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
you know predict uh the weather, that's
 

1345
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,789
you know predict uh the weather, that's
probably not going to work. Or even if I

1346
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
probably not going to work. Or even if I
 

1347
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,470
probably not going to work. Or even if I
say I trained a model to predict house

1348
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
say I trained a model to predict house
 

1349
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,350
say I trained a model to predict house
prices in the Bay Area and then I wanted

1350
00:29:59,350 --> 00:29:59,360
prices in the Bay Area and then I wanted
 

1351
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,110
prices in the Bay Area and then I wanted
to use this model to predict house

1352
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
to use this model to predict house
 

1353
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,070
to use this model to predict house
prices in New York. Well, my data is

1354
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,080
prices in New York. Well, my data is
 

1355
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,110
prices in New York. Well, my data is
going to be drawn from completely

1356
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,120
going to be drawn from completely
 

1357
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,630
going to be drawn from completely
distrib different distributions. these

1358
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
distrib different distributions. these
 

1359
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,190
distrib different distributions. these
models might not work. But the idea of

1360
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,200
models might not work. But the idea of
 

1361
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,470
models might not work. But the idea of
foundation models is uh a fundamentally

1362
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480
foundation models is uh a fundamentally
 

1363
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,389
foundation models is uh a fundamentally
different perspective where we're saying

1364
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
different perspective where we're saying
 

1365
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,710
different perspective where we're saying
look we're just going to train data on a

1366
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:16,720
look we're just going to train data on a
 

1367
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,710
look we're just going to train data on a
bunch uh train models on a bunch of

1368
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,720
bunch uh train models on a bunch of
 

1369
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,029
bunch uh train models on a bunch of
different data without necessarily even

1370
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:21,039
different data without necessarily even
 

1371
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,669
different data without necessarily even
having a particular task in mind and

1372
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:23,679
having a particular task in mind and
 

1373
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,190
having a particular task in mind and
we'll hope that the models will learn

1374
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
we'll hope that the models will learn
 

1375
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,789
we'll hope that the models will learn
some underlying representation of the

1376
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799
some underlying representation of the
 

1377
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,149
some underlying representation of the
data and then we can fine-tune it and

1378
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:30,159
data and then we can fine-tune it and
 

1379
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,710
data and then we can fine-tune it and
use the representations that is somehow

1380
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:32,720
use the representations that is somehow
 

1381
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,070
use the representations that is somehow
learned in an underlying way to you know

engineering considerations are shifting
and we are going to be teaching you

1418
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:08,720
and we are going to be teaching you
 

1419
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,430
and we are going to be teaching you
about that shift um in the in the

1420
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:11,440
about that shift um in the in the
 

1421
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,630
about that shift um in the in the
course. Probably in your machine

1422
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:12,640
course. Probably in your machine
 

1423
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,070
course. Probably in your machine
learning class you've just never touched

1424
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,080
learning class you've just never touched
 

1425
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,990
learning class you've just never touched
this issue at all. You only train models

1426
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,000
this issue at all. You only train models
 

1427
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,510
this issue at all. You only train models
from scratch for a specific purpose and

1428
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:17,520
from scratch for a specific purpose and
 

1429
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,110
from scratch for a specific purpose and
we were kind of told this is a paradigm

1430
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,120
we were kind of told this is a paradigm
 

1431
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,549
we were kind of told this is a paradigm
and we just want to make you aware

1432
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
and we just want to make you aware
 

1433
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,830
and we just want to make you aware
paradigms do shift.

1434
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:23,840
paradigms do shift.
 

1435
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,710
paradigms do shift.
>> Okay. So with this um these are just

1436
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:26,720
>> Okay. So with this um these are just
 

1437
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,789
>> Okay. So with this um these are just
some examples of you know supervised

1438
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:28,799
some examples of you know supervised
 

1439
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,750
some examples of you know supervised
learning tasks. Um these are nice uh

1440
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:31,760
learning tasks. Um these are nice uh
 

1441
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,990
learning tasks. Um these are nice uh
examples from the prince book. Here's an

1442
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:34,000
examples from the prince book. Here's an
 

1443
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,710
examples from the prince book. Here's an
example of uh generative modeling. So

1444
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
example of uh generative modeling. So
 

1445
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,549
example of uh generative modeling. So
these are generated

1446
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:38,559
these are generated
 

1447
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,230
these are generated
uh models. These are not real cats. So

1448
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240
uh models. These are not real cats. So
 

1449
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,950
uh models. These are not real cats. So
some examples. Okay.

1450
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:44,960
some examples. Okay.
 

1451
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,669
some examples. Okay.
So with this now I'm going to start

1452
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:47,679
So with this now I'm going to start
 

1453
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,509
So with this now I'm going to start
writing. I highly encourage everyone to

1454
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
writing. I highly encourage everyone to
 

1455
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,950
writing. I highly encourage everyone to
take notes and it's I'm really happy to

1456
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
take notes and it's I'm really happy to
 

1457
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,630
take notes and it's I'm really happy to
see that a bunch of people are taking

1458
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,640
see that a bunch of people are taking
 

1459
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,789
see that a bunch of people are taking
notes. For those of you who have laptops

1460
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:54,799
notes. For those of you who have laptops
 

1461
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,549
notes. For those of you who have laptops
open, I assume that you're using this

1462
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:56,559
open, I assume that you're using this
 

1463
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,310
open, I assume that you're using this
laptop to do something that is helping

1464
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,320
laptop to do something that is helping
 

1465
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,750
laptop to do something that is helping
you learn actively right now in this

1466
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
you learn actively right now in this
 

1467
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,070
you learn actively right now in this
class. Otherwise, I strongly encourage

1468
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
class. Otherwise, I strongly encourage
 

1469
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,190
class. Otherwise, I strongly encourage
you to put those laptops away. Um,

1470
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:07,200
you to put those laptops away. Um,
 

1471
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,029
you to put those laptops away. Um,
because it's distracting to you and it's

1472
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,039
because it's distracting to you and it's
 

1473
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,110
because it's distracting to you and it's
distracting to your neighbors. So, if

1474
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,120
distracting to your neighbors. So, if
 

1475
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,310
distracting to your neighbors. So, if
it's really essential for you to use

1476
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,320
it's really essential for you to use
 

1477
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,110
it's really essential for you to use
your laptop, go for it. But I encourage

1478
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
your laptop, go for it. But I encourage
 

1479
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,190
your laptop, go for it. But I encourage
you to take notes especially with now I

1480
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:17,200
you to take notes especially with now I
 

1481
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,230
you to take notes especially with now I
haven't really made slides for this

1482
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,240
haven't really made slides for this
 

1483
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,149
haven't really made slides for this
because I want to be able to write and

1484
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:20,159
because I want to be able to write and
 

1485
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,909
because I want to be able to write and
uh have support you writing as I'm

1486
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:21,919
uh have support you writing as I'm
 

1487
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:33,269
uh have support you writing as I'm
writing. Okay.

1488
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:33,279

 

1489
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,110

I think I just pulled the cable but

1490
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,120
I think I just pulled the cable but
 

1491
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,070
I think I just pulled the cable but
yeah. Okay. Good. Okay. So now we're

1492
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,080
yeah. Okay. Good. Okay. So now we're
 

1493
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,149
yeah. Okay. Good. Okay. So now we're
going to be talking about

1494
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:42,159
going to be talking about
 

1495
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:51,750
going to be talking about
optimization.

1496
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:51,760

 

1497
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,190

So we have in our case some XY pairs.

1498
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,200
So we have in our case some XY pairs.
 

1499
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,149
So we have in our case some XY pairs.
This is our data. And what we're trying

1500
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:58,159
This is our data. And what we're trying
 

1501
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,310
This is our data. And what we're trying
to do is we want to be able to basically

1502
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,320
to do is we want to be able to basically
 

1503
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,990
to do is we want to be able to basically
take in our data and predict a label. So

1504
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,000
take in our data and predict a label. So
 

1505
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,909
take in our data and predict a label. So
we have some training data. But what we

1506
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
we have some training data. But what we
 

1507
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,350
we have some training data. But what we
want to be able to do is we want to do

1508
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,360
want to be able to do is we want to do
 

1509
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,509
want to be able to do is we want to do
something with some new data. Given a

1510
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
something with some new data. Given a
 

1511
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,509
something with some new data. Given a
new sample X, I want to be able to

1512
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:11,519
new sample X, I want to be able to
 

1513
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,909
new sample X, I want to be able to
predict what is the label for example Y

1514
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:13,919
predict what is the label for example Y
 

1515
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,389
predict what is the label for example Y
on it. And for this we want to have some

1516
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:16,399
on it. And for this we want to have some
 

1517
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,350
on it. And for this we want to have some
model. Let's call that model

1518
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:19,360
model. Let's call that model
 

1519
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,470
model. Let's call that model
F theta of X. And this gives us Y. And

1520
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,480
F theta of X. And this gives us Y. And
 

1521
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,990
F theta of X. And this gives us Y. And
so here again X is my input,

1522
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,000
so here again X is my input,
 

1523
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,710
so here again X is my input,
Y is my output.

1524
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:30,720
Y is my output.
 

1525
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,549
Y is my output.
And here now I've introduced something

1526
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:32,559
And here now I've introduced something
 

1527
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,590
And here now I've introduced something
new. I've introduced this theta. And

1528
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:35,600
new. I've introduced this theta. And
 

1529
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,470
new. I've introduced this theta. And
these theta are my parameters.

1530
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:40,480

 

1531
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,190

Okay,

1532
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
Okay,
 

1533
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,070
Okay,
maybe I'll try.

1534
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,080

 

1535
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,389

So, how am I going to do this? Well, I

1536
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:50,399
So, how am I going to do this? Well, I
 

1537
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,470
So, how am I going to do this? Well, I
really want what do I want out of my f

1538
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,480
really want what do I want out of my f
 

1539
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,990
really want what do I want out of my f
theta? I want to be able to do something

1540
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,000
theta? I want to be able to do something
 

1541
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,029
theta? I want to be able to do something
that takes in real world data and gives

1542
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:57,039
that takes in real world data and gives
 

1543
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,190
that takes in real world data and gives
me an output and gives me a label of

1544
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,200
me an output and gives me a label of
 

1545
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,750
me an output and gives me a label of
that real thing.

1546
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:01,760
that real thing.
 

1547
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,549
that real thing.
What do I actually have in my hand? In

1548
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:04,559
What do I actually have in my hand? In
 

1549
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,110
What do I actually have in my hand? In
my hand, I have just samples of training

1550
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,120
my hand, I have just samples of training
 

1551
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,470
my hand, I have just samples of training
data. I have x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3. Right?

1552
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:12,480
data. I have x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3. Right?
 

1553
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,270
data. I have x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3. Right?
So the best thing I can do is I can say

1554
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,280
So the best thing I can do is I can say
 

1555
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,030
So the best thing I can do is I can say
well let me try to do the best I can

1556
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,040
well let me try to do the best I can
 

1557
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,069
well let me try to do the best I can
given my training data. Right? So what I

1558
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:22,079
given my training data. Right? So what I
 

1559
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:38,389
given my training data. Right? So what I
have

1560
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:38,399

 

1561
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,230

And the kind of standard thing that we

1562
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,240
And the kind of standard thing that we
 

1563
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,510
And the kind of standard thing that we
always do in machine learning is we do

1564
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:43,520
always do in machine learning is we do
 

1565
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,589
always do in machine learning is we do
risk minimization or empirical risk

1566
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:45,599
risk minimization or empirical risk
 

1567
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,230
risk minimization or empirical risk
minimization

1568
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,240

 

1569
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:58,470

on this training data

1570
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:58,480

 

1571
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,270

where let's say I'm taking some I want

1572
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:01,280
where let's say I'm taking some I want
 

1573
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,790
where let's say I'm taking some I want
to look at the argument

1574
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
to look at the argument
 

1575
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,589
to look at the argument
over theta

1576
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:07,599

 

1577
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,390

of now my loss function.

1578
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:10,400
of now my loss function.
 

1579
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,910
of now my loss function.
So I'm looking at this loss function.

1580
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:11,920
So I'm looking at this loss function.
 

1581
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,470
So I'm looking at this loss function.
This L is my loss function.

1582
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:14,480
This L is my loss function.
 

1583
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,950
This L is my loss function.
Y I

1584
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
Y I
 

1585
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,430
Y I
F theta

1586
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,440
F theta
 

1587
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,390
F theta
XI.

1588
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,400
XI.
 

1589
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,790
XI.
So let me unpack this a little bit now.

1590
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:26,800
So let me unpack this a little bit now.
 

1591
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,829
So let me unpack this a little bit now.
So this L here represents my loss

1592
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:29,839
So this L here represents my loss
 

1593
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,550
So this L here represents my loss
function. It's telling me how much do I

1594
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:32,560
function. It's telling me how much do I
 

1595
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,910
function. It's telling me how much do I
care and how do I care when what my

1596
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:35,920
care and how do I care when what my
 

1597
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,349
care and how do I care when what my
model predicts which is this f theta of

1598
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
model predicts which is this f theta of
 

1599
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,870
model predicts which is this f theta of
xi is different from yi right so this

1600
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:42,880
xi is different from yi right so this
 

1601
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,750
xi is different from yi right so this
could be for example squared loss it

1602
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:45,760
could be for example squared loss it
 

1603
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,710
could be for example squared loss it
could be cross entropy loss whatever

1604
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720
could be cross entropy loss whatever
 

1605
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,109
could be cross entropy loss whatever
pick your favorite loss function right

1606
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:51,119
pick your favorite loss function right
 

1607
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,310
pick your favorite loss function right
this is telling me in what way do I care

1608
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,320
this is telling me in what way do I care
 

1609
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,870
this is telling me in what way do I care
when I get it wrong and I'm going to say

1610
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:56,880
when I get it wrong and I'm going to say
 

1611
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,710
when I get it wrong and I'm going to say
look how many data points do I have

1612
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:58,720
look how many data points do I have
 

1613
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,030
look how many data points do I have
let's say I have n training data points.

1614
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,040
let's say I have n training data points.
 

1615
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,349
let's say I have n training data points.
Well, these are my n samples. I'm going

1616
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:03,359
Well, these are my n samples. I'm going
 

1617
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,030
Well, these are my n samples. I'm going
to look at the loss and the difference

1618
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,040
to look at the loss and the difference
 

1619
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,910
to look at the loss and the difference
between yi and uh uh I I'm going to look

1620
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:07,920
between yi and uh uh I I'm going to look
 

1621
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,190
between yi and uh uh I I'm going to look
at the loss for each of these data

1622
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,200
at the loss for each of these data
 

1623
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,230
at the loss for each of these data
points and then average them. And then I

1624
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:12,240
points and then average them. And then I
 

1625
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,310
points and then average them. And then I
want to find that parameter. I want to

1626
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:14,320
want to find that parameter. I want to
 

1627
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,190
want to find that parameter. I want to
find that theta

1628
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,200
find that theta
 

1629
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,750
find that theta
that minimizes this average loss. Right?

1630
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
that minimizes this average loss. Right?
 

1631
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,750
that minimizes this average loss. Right?
This is a specific well- definfined

1632
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760
This is a specific well- definfined
 

1633
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,030
This is a specific well- definfined
quantity that I can compute using my

1634
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,040
quantity that I can compute using my
 

1635
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,710
quantity that I can compute using my
training data. So why do I care about

1636
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:28,720
training data. So why do I care about
 

1637
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,030
training data. So why do I care about
this particular loss? Is there something

1638
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,040
this particular loss? Is there something
 

1639
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,829
this particular loss? Is there something
special about this?

1640
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839
special about this?
 

1641
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,230
special about this?
In some sense, yes, it's the thing I

1642
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:38,240
In some sense, yes, it's the thing I
 

1643
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,630
In some sense, yes, it's the thing I
have. I care about this because the

1644
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:40,640
have. I care about this because the
 

1645
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,430
have. I care about this because the
training data is the data that I have.

1646
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,440
training data is the data that I have.
 

1647
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,829
training data is the data that I have.
Right? So as we talked about in the

1648
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:45,839
Right? So as we talked about in the
 

1649
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,390
Right? So as we talked about in the
first lecture, there's an element of

1650
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,400
first lecture, there's an element of
 

1651
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,150
first lecture, there's an element of
looking where the light is here. You

1652
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,160
looking where the light is here. You
 

1653
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,150
looking where the light is here. You
know, why are we choosing to fit a model

1654
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,160
know, why are we choosing to fit a model
 

1655
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,630
know, why are we choosing to fit a model
to our training data? Because we have

1656
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:54,640
to our training data? Because we have
 

1657
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,109
to our training data? Because we have
that training data. If I had more data,

1658
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:57,119
that training data. If I had more data,
 

1659
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,270
that training data. If I had more data,
if I had other data, I would love to fit

1660
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,280
if I had other data, I would love to fit
 

1661
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,069
if I had other data, I would love to fit
a model to that, but I don't have it.

1662
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:02,079
a model to that, but I don't have it.
 

1663
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,190
a model to that, but I don't have it.
So, what sometimes can happen in, you

1664
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,200
So, what sometimes can happen in, you
 

1665
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,950
So, what sometimes can happen in, you
know, thinking about uh training these

1666
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:06,960
know, thinking about uh training these
 

1667
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,109
know, thinking about uh training these
models is that we get so focused on the

1668
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:09,119
models is that we get so focused on the
 

1669
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,270
models is that we get so focused on the
training data that we think that fitting

1670
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,280
training data that we think that fitting
 

1671
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,790
training data that we think that fitting
the model to the data is the point. But

1672
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:14,800
the model to the data is the point. But
 

1673
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,550
the model to the data is the point. But
that's actually not the point. The point

1674
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:16,560
that's actually not the point. The point
 

1675
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,710
that's actually not the point. The point
is to be able to predict something about

1676
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:20,720
is to be able to predict something about
 

1677
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,710
is to be able to predict something about
some real world data. That's what we're

1678
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:22,720
some real world data. That's what we're
 

1679
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,150
some real world data. That's what we're
trying to do. But we have reduced it to

1680
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,160
trying to do. But we have reduced it to
 

1681
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,069
trying to do. But we have reduced it to
this problem of fitting a model to this

1682
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:28,079
this problem of fitting a model to this
 

1683
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,510
this problem of fitting a model to this
training data because that is what we

1684
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520
training data because that is what we
 

1685
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,390
training data because that is what we
know how to do. It's kind of like you

1686
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:32,400
know how to do. It's kind of like you
 

1687
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,750
know how to do. It's kind of like you
sometimes think about all right why do I

1688
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:33,760
sometimes think about all right why do I
 

1689
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,190
sometimes think about all right why do I
why do we like linear models? We like

1690
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,200
why do we like linear models? We like
 

1691
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,630
why do we like linear models? We like
linear models because we understand them

1692
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:36,640
linear models because we understand them
 

1693
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,990
linear models because we understand them
because we can do something with them.

1694
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,000
because we can do something with them.
 

1695
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,270
because we can do something with them.
It's the same kind of thing. We like the

1696
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:39,280
It's the same kind of thing. We like the
 

1697
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,710
It's the same kind of thing. We like the
training data because we have it in our

1698
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
training data because we have it in our
 

1699
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,710
training data because we have it in our
pocket.

1700
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:42,720
pocket.
 

1701
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,270
pocket.
So how do we then go from this once we

1702
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
So how do we then go from this once we
 

1703
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,710
So how do we then go from this once we
acknowledge this? How do we go from this

1704
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:46,720
acknowledge this? How do we go from this
 

1705
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,270
acknowledge this? How do we go from this
to trying to you know approximate how

1706
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:49,280
to trying to you know approximate how
 

1707
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,510
to trying to you know approximate how
well we can do in the real world? How do

1708
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:51,520
well we can do in the real world? How do
 

1709
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,349
well we can do in the real world? How do
we actually measure how well we can do?

1710
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:53,359
we actually measure how well we can do?
 

1711
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,150
we actually measure how well we can do?
Right. So for this we have basically

1712
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,160
Right. So for this we have basically
 

1713
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,190
Right. So for this we have basically
hold out test data. So we say look you

1714
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,200
hold out test data. So we say look you
 

1715
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,069
hold out test data. So we say look you
know if I want to be able to approximate

1716
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:02,079
know if I want to be able to approximate
 

1717
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,390
know if I want to be able to approximate
what I can do on a real true new sample

1718
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:04,400
what I can do on a real true new sample
 

1719
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,470
what I can do on a real true new sample
that I have never seen before and I want

1720
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,480
that I have never seen before and I want
 

1721
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,790
that I have never seen before and I want
to measure if my model is good or not.

1722
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:08,800
to measure if my model is good or not.
 

1723
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,430
to measure if my model is good or not.
The best thing I can do is I look at the

1724
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,440
The best thing I can do is I look at the
 

1725
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,069
The best thing I can do is I look at the
data that I have. I hold out some of it.

1726
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:14,079
data that I have. I hold out some of it.
 

1727
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,030
data that I have. I hold out some of it.
I pretend as though I have never seen it

1728
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,040
I pretend as though I have never seen it
 

1729
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,829
I pretend as though I have never seen it
before and I try to fit a model and I

1730
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:21,839
before and I try to fit a model and I
 

1731
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,230
before and I try to fit a model and I
and I measure my performance of my model

1732
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,240
and I measure my performance of my model
 

1733
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,670
and I measure my performance of my model
that has been trained on this other

1734
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,680
that has been trained on this other
 

1735
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,910
that has been trained on this other
training data on this new data that I've

1736
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:27,920
training data on this new data that I've
 

1737
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,589
training data on this new data that I've
never seen. Right? So that is what we

1738
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599
never seen. Right? So that is what we
 

1739
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,790
never seen. Right? So that is what we
think about as as hold out test data.

1740
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:32,800
think about as as hold out test data.
 

1741
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,430
think about as as hold out test data.
But how do we now even kind of measure

1742
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:35,440
But how do we now even kind of measure
 

1743
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,630
But how do we now even kind of measure
this or how do we get a sense of

1744
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:38,640
this or how do we get a sense of
 

1745
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,670
this or how do we get a sense of
how well we're doing? And because we

1746
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:41,680
how well we're doing? And because we
 

1747
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,190
how well we're doing? And because we
don't know anything about the real world

1748
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,200
don't know anything about the real world
 

1749
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,109
don't know anything about the real world
data like say let's say you're trying to

1750
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:45,119
data like say let's say you're trying to
 

1751
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,950
data like say let's say you're trying to
you know uh predict uh labels on

1752
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:48,960
you know uh predict uh labels on
 

1753
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,270
you know uh predict uh labels on
different kinds of animals and you have

1754
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,280
different kinds of animals and you have
 

1755
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,790
different kinds of animals and you have
a label prediction for cats and dogs and

1756
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:54,800
a label prediction for cats and dogs and
 

1757
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,829
a label prediction for cats and dogs and
cows and sheep and snakes and you know

1758
00:38:57,829 --> 00:38:57,839
cows and sheep and snakes and you know
 

1759
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,470
cows and sheep and snakes and you know
so on and so forth

1760
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,480
so on and so forth
 

1761
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,910
so on and so forth
and if I could have a full distribution

1762
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:03,920
and if I could have a full distribution
 

1763
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,790
and if I could have a full distribution
on the you know

1764
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:06,800
on the you know
 

1765
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,710
on the you know
all the animals in the world I would

1766
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:08,720
all the animals in the world I would
 

1767
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,390
all the animals in the world I would
love to have that but I don't actually

1768
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:10,400
love to have that but I don't actually
 

1769
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,990
love to have that but I don't actually
know what that distribution is. Maybe I

1770
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,000
know what that distribution is. Maybe I
 

1771
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,870
know what that distribution is. Maybe I
train on a bunch of stuff that is, you

1772
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:14,880
train on a bunch of stuff that is, you
 

1773
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,550
train on a bunch of stuff that is, you
know, animals and then I get a picture

1774
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,560
know, animals and then I get a picture
 

1775
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,470
know, animals and then I get a picture
of a bunch of dinosaurs.

1776
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:20,480

 

1777
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,150

You know, clearly my model that has

1778
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,160
You know, clearly my model that has
 

1779
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,670
You know, clearly my model that has
never seen a picture of a dinosaur

1780
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:23,680
never seen a picture of a dinosaur
 

1781
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,150
never seen a picture of a dinosaur
before is not going to do well on this.

1782
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,160
before is not going to do well on this.
 

1783
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,870
before is not going to do well on this.
So to be able to make some sense of how

1784
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:28,880
So to be able to make some sense of how
 

1785
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,870
So to be able to make some sense of how
we are

1786
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:30,880
we are
 

1787
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,190
we are
um going to be able to do, we have to

1788
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
um going to be able to do, we have to
 

1789
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,910
um going to be able to do, we have to
make some additional assumptions on our

1790
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:35,920
make some additional assumptions on our
 

1791
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,310
make some additional assumptions on our
data. Right? If we can't say anything,

1792
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,320
data. Right? If we can't say anything,
 

1793
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,589
data. Right? If we can't say anything,
it's going to be really hard to give

1794
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:39,599
it's going to be really hard to give
 

1795
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,270
it's going to be really hard to give
guarantees about what we can do because

1796
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,280
guarantees about what we can do because
 

1797
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,790
guarantees about what we can do because
well, the real world can do lots of

1798
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:42,800
well, the real world can do lots of
 

1799
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,349
well, the real world can do lots of
really crazy things. So the key

1800
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
really crazy things. So the key
 

1801
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,030
really crazy things. So the key
assumption that we often make in this

1802
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,040
assumption that we often make in this
 

1803
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,310
assumption that we often make in this
setup is we assume

1804
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:50,320
setup is we assume
 

1805
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,270
setup is we assume
I don't want this color.

1806
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,280

 

1807
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:02,870

So key assumption

1808
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:02,880

 

1809
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:10,390

is we assume that X and Y are drawn

1810
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,400

 

1811
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,190

from a distribution

1812
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,200
from a distribution
 

1813
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,510
from a distribution
P XY. So I say that I have a joint

1814
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:17,520
P XY. So I say that I have a joint
 

1815
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,630
P XY. So I say that I have a joint
distribution from which these labels and

1816
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,640
distribution from which these labels and
 

1817
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,750
distribution from which these labels and
these uh data points are drawn. And

1818
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:23,760
these uh data points are drawn. And
 

1819
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,670
these uh data points are drawn. And
let's say my training data and my test

1820
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:25,680
let's say my training data and my test
 

1821
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,109
let's say my training data and my test
data are coming from uh these same same

1822
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:29,119
data are coming from uh these same same
 

1823
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,470
data are coming from uh these same same
situations. This might not always be

1824
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:30,480
situations. This might not always be
 

1825
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,390
situations. This might not always be
true but often this is an assumption

1826
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,400
true but often this is an assumption
 

1827
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,750
true but often this is an assumption
that we will make to be able to

1828
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:33,760
that we will make to be able to
 

1829
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,710
that we will make to be able to
understand what our performance is. And

1830
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:36,720
understand what our performance is. And
 

1831
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,069
understand what our performance is. And
then we can think of our theta star

1832
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
then we can think of our theta star
 

1833
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,270
then we can think of our theta star
as the argument

1834
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,280
as the argument
 

1835
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,670
as the argument
of theta over that expectation. Now now

1836
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:45,680
of theta over that expectation. Now now
 

1837
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,270
of theta over that expectation. Now now
we can take an expectation over this

1838
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,280
we can take an expectation over this
 

1839
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,190
we can take an expectation over this
distribution. We can think of this as

1840
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,200
distribution. We can think of this as
 

1841
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,109
distribution. We can think of this as
the loss of yi comma fa

1842
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:55,119
the loss of yi comma fa
 

1843
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,870
the loss of yi comma fa
x i

1844
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:56,880
x i
 

1845
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:15,190
x i
>> what? Oh.

1846
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,200

 

1847
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,109

So this is basically the thing that we

1848
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
So this is basically the thing that we
 

1849
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,510
So this is basically the thing that we
can use to try and uh capture the idea

1850
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:19,520
can use to try and uh capture the idea
 

1851
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,069
can use to try and uh capture the idea
of our uh of generalization right how

1852
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:22,079
of our uh of generalization right how
 

1853
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,470
of our uh of generalization right how
well can we train can we predict

1854
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,480
well can we train can we predict
 

1855
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,390
well can we train can we predict
something on data that we have not yet

1856
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:26,400
something on data that we have not yet
 

1857
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,589
something on data that we have not yet
seen okay but even with this we have

1858
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:29,599
seen okay but even with this we have
 

1859
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,950
seen okay but even with this we have
some challenges and

1860
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:32,960
some challenges and
 

1861
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,430
some challenges and
it's not like we can completely uh solve

1862
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:35,440
it's not like we can completely uh solve
 

1863
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,349
it's not like we can completely uh solve
this problem. So what are some of the

1864
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:37,359
this problem. So what are some of the
 

1865
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,109
this problem. So what are some of the
key challenges that we that we see in

1866
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:39,119
key challenges that we that we see in
 

1867
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,950
key challenges that we that we see in
something like this? Well, the first

1868
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:40,960
something like this? Well, the first
 

1869
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,550
something like this? Well, the first
challenge for example,

1870
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:44,560
challenge for example,
 

1871
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,630
challenge for example,
challenge one

1872
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:46,640
challenge one
 

1873
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,910
challenge one
is that well, we've assumed that we have

1874
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:49,920
is that well, we've assumed that we have
 

1875
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,910
is that well, we've assumed that we have
some underlying distribution pxy, but we

1876
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:53,920
some underlying distribution pxy, but we
 

1877
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:02,390
some underlying distribution pxy, but we
actually don't know what this is, right?

1878
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400

 

1879
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,150

So, we don't know this. And so, how do

1880
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,160
So, we don't know this. And so, how do
 

1881
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,230
So, we don't know this. And so, how do
we handle that?

1882
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,240
we handle that?
 

1883
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,030
we handle that?
Well, we handle that essentially through

1884
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,040
Well, we handle that essentially through
 

1885
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,790
Well, we handle that essentially through
having our heldout test set, right?

1886
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:10,800
having our heldout test set, right?
 

1887
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,630
having our heldout test set, right?
We're having an assumption that all of

1888
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:12,640
We're having an assumption that all of
 

1889
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,030
We're having an assumption that all of
our data is coming from this underlying

1890
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,040
our data is coming from this underlying
 

1891
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,390
our data is coming from this underlying
distribution pxy. And so we say, well,

1892
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:18,400
distribution pxy. And so we say, well,
 

1893
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,150
distribution pxy. And so we say, well,
the best we can do is we have this test

1894
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,160
the best we can do is we have this test
 

1895
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,230
the best we can do is we have this test
set. Let's pretend that that's the

1896
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,240
set. Let's pretend that that's the
 

1897
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,430
set. Let's pretend that that's the
distribution. Let's assume that that's

1898
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:23,440
distribution. Let's assume that that's
 

1899
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,710
distribution. Let's assume that that's
the underlying distribution. We will

1900
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
the underlying distribution. We will
 

1901
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,190
the underlying distribution. We will
measure performance on the test set as

1902
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:27,200
measure performance on the test set as
 

1903
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,030
measure performance on the test set as
an approximation

1904
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,040
an approximation
 

1905
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,190
an approximation
of this true um underlying expectation

1906
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,200
of this true um underlying expectation
 

1907
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,270
of this true um underlying expectation
that we actually want to capture. Okay,

1908
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
that we actually want to capture. Okay,
 

1909
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,030
that we actually want to capture. Okay,
does that make sense to everyone?

1910
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,040
does that make sense to everyone?
 

1911
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,589
does that make sense to everyone?
Everyone with me? Questions? Add

1912
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:39,599
Everyone with me? Questions? Add
 

1913
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,069
Everyone with me? Questions? Add
something?

1914
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:40,079
something?
 

1915
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,390
something?
>> Yeah. Just a comment here is it's more

1916
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400
>> Yeah. Just a comment here is it's more
 

1917
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,790
>> Yeah. Just a comment here is it's more
way of thinking, right? Um when you're

1918
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:44,800
way of thinking, right? Um when you're
 

1919
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,950
way of thinking, right? Um when you're
getting when given a problem, you often

1920
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:46,960
getting when given a problem, you often
 

1921
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,790
getting when given a problem, you often
are told everything the problem states

1922
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:48,800
are told everything the problem states
 

1923
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,510
are told everything the problem states
is just taken as god-given, right? But

1924
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:51,520
is just taken as god-given, right? But
 

1925
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,270
is just taken as god-given, right? But
real life isn't like that. So, we're

1926
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,280
real life isn't like that. So, we're
 

1927
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,950
real life isn't like that. So, we're
trying to point out to here is that we

1928
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
trying to point out to here is that we
 

1929
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,190
trying to point out to here is that we
make assumptions to help us think, but

1930
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:57,200
make assumptions to help us think, but
 

1931
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,550
make assumptions to help us think, but
then we know those assumptions don't

1932
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:58,560
then we know those assumptions don't
 

1933
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,190
then we know those assumptions don't
hold and you have to do something. This

1934
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,200
hold and you have to do something. This
 

1935
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,190
hold and you have to do something. This
key distinction of what are the

1936
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
key distinction of what are the
 

1937
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,150
key distinction of what are the
assumptions you're making that are

1938
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,160
assumptions you're making that are
 

1939
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,990
assumptions you're making that are
helping you think and then what are the

1940
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:06,000
helping you think and then what are the
 

1941
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,470
helping you think and then what are the
things you have to actually do and how

1942
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:08,480
things you have to actually do and how
 

1943
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,390
things you have to actually do and how
do you bridge that gap is important to

1944
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:10,400
do you bridge that gap is important to
 

1945
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:57,349
do you bridge that gap is important to
keep in mind

1946
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:57,359

 

1947
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,109

Okay, so the second challenge that you

1948
00:43:59,109 --> 00:43:59,119
Okay, so the second challenge that you
 

1949
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,109
Okay, so the second challenge that you
might have is that well I have this loss

1950
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
might have is that well I have this loss
 

1951
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,390
might have is that well I have this loss
function and that's great but maybe it

1952
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:04,400
function and that's great but maybe it
 

1953
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,470
function and that's great but maybe it
doesn't work well with the kinds of

1954
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480
doesn't work well with the kinds of
 

1955
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,710
doesn't work well with the kinds of
optimizers that I want to use. As we're

1956
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:08,720
optimizers that I want to use. As we're
 

1957
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,230
optimizers that I want to use. As we're
going to talk about optimization is kind

1958
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:10,240
going to talk about optimization is kind
 

1959
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,390
going to talk about optimization is kind
of the heart of um a lot of machine

1960
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:12,400
of the heart of um a lot of machine
 

1961
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,990
of the heart of um a lot of machine
learning.

1962
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
learning.
 

1963
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,990
learning.
So you want things that you can actually

1964
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:16,000
So you want things that you can actually
 

1965
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,309
So you want things that you can actually
run algorithms like gradient descent on,

1966
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:18,319
run algorithms like gradient descent on,
 

1967
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,349
run algorithms like gradient descent on,
right? And if you have non-ifferiable

1968
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:21,359
right? And if you have non-ifferiable
 

1969
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,950
right? And if you have non-ifferiable
losses, well that's just not going to

1970
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:22,960
losses, well that's just not going to
 

1971
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,349
losses, well that's just not going to
really work very well. And so the key

1972
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:25,359
really work very well. And so the key
 

1973
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,430
really work very well. And so the key
solution here is that well if your loss

1974
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:27,440
solution here is that well if your loss
 

1975
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,270
solution here is that well if your loss
doesn't work

1976
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,280
doesn't work
 

1977
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,069
doesn't work
find another loss

1978
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:32,079
find another loss
 

1979
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,829
find another loss
um you know make it somehow make it

1980
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:33,839
um you know make it somehow make it
 

1981
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,829
um you know make it somehow make it
smooth make it continuous lose the non-

1982
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:35,839
smooth make it continuous lose the non-
 

1983
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,750
smooth make it continuous lose the non-
differential abilities to be able to

1984
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:37,760
differential abilities to be able to
 

1985
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,710
differential abilities to be able to
make it work again um as was emphasized

1986
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:40,720
make it work again um as was emphasized
 

1987
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,470
make it work again um as was emphasized
in the earlier lecture it's about what

1988
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:42,480
in the earlier lecture it's about what
 

1989
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,510
in the earlier lecture it's about what
can you do to make things work right

1990
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,520
can you do to make things work right
 

1991
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,230
can you do to make things work right
it's not about what would be perfect in

1992
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:48,240
it's not about what would be perfect in
 

1993
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,430
it's not about what would be perfect in
the ideal world it's um it's a there

1994
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:51,440
the ideal world it's um it's a there
 

1995
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,790
the ideal world it's um it's a there
there is an element of what is the

1996
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:52,800
there is an element of what is the
 

1997
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,309
there is an element of what is the
engineering problem to solve we to have

1998
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
engineering problem to solve we to have
 

1999
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,990
engineering problem to solve we to have
a sum loss by on which we can run

2000
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:56,000
a sum loss by on which we can run
 

2001
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,190
a sum loss by on which we can run
gradient descent. So um that's one key

2002
00:44:59,190 --> 00:44:59,200
gradient descent. So um that's one key
 

2003
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:07,910
gradient descent. So um that's one key
thing and then there's a third challenge

2004
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:07,920

 

2005
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,950

which is

2006
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:10,960
which is
 

2007
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,309
which is
let's say I did the all of this I found

2008
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:14,319
let's say I did the all of this I found
 

2009
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,670
let's say I did the all of this I found
some you know I found I made this

2010
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:17,680
some you know I found I made this
 

2011
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,870
some you know I found I made this
assumption I found a loss that works and

2012
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:20,880
assumption I found a loss that works and
 

2013
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,710
assumption I found a loss that works and
I even found a theta hat right I fit my

2014
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
I even found a theta hat right I fit my
 

2015
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,349
I even found a theta hat right I fit my
model I solved my optimization problem

2016
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:27,359
model I solved my optimization problem
 

2017
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,790
model I solved my optimization problem
here. I got a theta hat. Great.

2018
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:32,800
here. I got a theta hat. Great.
 

2019
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,349
here. I got a theta hat. Great.
Theta hat works

2020
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:35,359
Theta hat works
 

2021
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,190
Theta hat works
great

2022
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:37,200
great
 

2023
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,670
great
on training data.

2024
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:41,680

 

2025
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,990

But then I actually run it and evaluate

2026
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,000
But then I actually run it and evaluate
 

2027
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,790
But then I actually run it and evaluate
it on my test data,

2028
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:46,800
it on my test data,
 

2029
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,109
it on my test data,
but fails

2030
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:49,119
but fails
 

2031
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,950
but fails
on

2032
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:50,960
on
 

2033
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,109
on
test data

2034
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:53,119
test data
 

2035
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,630
test data
in the sense that it performs really

2036
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:54,640
in the sense that it performs really
 

2037
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,150
in the sense that it performs really
poorly. I maybe shouldn't say fails.

2038
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160

performs poorly.

2040
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:04,319

 

2041
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,870

So somehow my theta hat has learned

2042
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
So somehow my theta hat has learned
 

2043
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,589
So somehow my theta hat has learned
something very very specific about the

2044
00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:09,599
something very very specific about the
 

2045
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,069
something very very specific about the
training data and is able to minimize

2046
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
training data and is able to minimize
 

2047
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,589
training data and is able to minimize
the loss there. Get that be very low.

2048
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:15,599
the loss there. Get that be very low.
 

2049
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,750
the loss there. Get that be very low.
But whenever I show it something that is

2050
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:17,760
But whenever I show it something that is
 

2051
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,430
But whenever I show it something that is
not from the training data,

2052
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:21,440
not from the training data,
 

2053
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,030
not from the training data,
it is completely failing. And the common

2054
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:25,040
it is completely failing. And the common
 

2055
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,190
it is completely failing. And the common
reason that this happens is essentially

2056
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,200
reason that this happens is essentially
 

2057
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,550
reason that this happens is essentially
overfitting, right? You've somehow fit

2058
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:30,560
overfitting, right? You've somehow fit
 

2059
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,910
overfitting, right? You've somehow fit
too closely to the exact examples that

2060
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:33,920
too closely to the exact examples that
 

2061
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,510
too closely to the exact examples that
you were given in the training data and

2062
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:35,520
you were given in the training data and
 

2063
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,510
you were given in the training data and
you're not able to generalize outside of

2064
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:37,520
you're not able to generalize outside of
 

2065
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,190
you're not able to generalize outside of
that to what might be your test data.

2066
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:41,200
that to what might be your test data.
 

2067
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,430
that to what might be your test data.
And so the common solution that we use

2068
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:43,440
And so the common solution that we use
 

2069
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,349
And so the common solution that we use
for this is something that you have seen

2070
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:45,359
for this is something that you have seen
 

2071
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:46,950
for this is something that you have seen
before

2072
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:46,960
before
 

2073
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,109
before
and that is regularization.

2074
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:53,119

 

2075
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,349

And what regularization does is it gives

2076
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:55,359
And what regularization does is it gives
 

2077
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,670
And what regularization does is it gives
you basically some

2078
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:57,680
you basically some
 

2079
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,710
you basically some
side information or some other pressure

2080
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:00,720
side information or some other pressure
 

2081
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,069
side information or some other pressure
on the parameters of your model to say

2082
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:04,079
on the parameters of your model to say
 

2083
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,870
on the parameters of your model to say
hey we love the training data but just

not that much you know
keep a little bit of distance. So try to

00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:13,119
keep a little bit of distance. So try to
 

2089
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,710
keep a little bit of distance. So try to
fit to something else. So the common

2090
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:14,720
fit to something else. So the common
 

2091
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,069
fit to something else. So the common

2124
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:00,400
can change this optimizer. So here I'm
 

2125
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,430
can change this optimizer. So here I'm
trying to find an argument

help you avoid this problem of

00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,230
help you avoid this problem of

overfitting by saying don't go too close
to that training data but of course with

problem. So now what is the problem that
 

2177
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,030
problem. So now what is the problem that
we have introduced by the solution of

we have introduced by the solution of

00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,270

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

engineering problem that we need to deal
 

2187
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:24,630
engineering problem that we need to deal

00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,230

It might be that this optimization

2190
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:26,240
It might be that this optimization
 

2191
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,750
It might be that this optimization
problem is harder to solve. That's

2192
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
problem is harder to solve. That's
 

2193
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,349
problem is harder to solve. That's
entirely possible. But I'm thinking of

2194
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:29,359
entirely possible. But I'm thinking of
 

2195
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,589
entirely possible. But I'm thinking of
something very boring. I'm like how to

00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:31,599
something very boring. I'm like how to
 

2197
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,750
something very boring. I'm like how to
write how to actually solve this thing.

2198
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:33,760
write how to actually solve this thing.
 

2199
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,829
write how to actually solve this thing.
What's lambda right now? There's one

2200
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:35,839
What's lambda right now? There's one
 

2201
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,950
What's lambda right now? There's one
more number that I have to deal with. Is

2202
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:38,960
more number that I have to deal with. Is
 

2203
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,589
more number that I have to deal with. Is
lambda one? Is it 0.1? Is it 10?

2204
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:43,599
lambda one? Is it 0.1? Is it 10?
 

2205
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,069
lambda one? Is it 0.1? Is it 10?
Each of these will give me a widely

2206
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:46,079
Each of these will give me a widely
 

2207
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,030
Each of these will give me a widely
different solution. Right? So it's not

2208
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,040
different solution. Right? So it's not
 

2209
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,870
different solution. Right? So it's not
like oh you just write ridge you call

2210
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:50,880
like oh you just write ridge you call
 

2211
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,190
like oh you just write ridge you call
ridge and it's solved. But it actually

2212
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:53,200
ridge and it's solved. But it actually
 

2213
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,270
ridge and it's solved. But it actually
matters what the parameters are. Now

2214
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:55,280
matters what the parameters are. Now
 

2215
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,990
matters what the parameters are. Now
what I've introduced here is what this

2216
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:58,000
what I've introduced here is what this
 

2217
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,150
what I've introduced here is what this
lambda is is now it's a hyperparameter

2218
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:00,160
lambda is is now it's a hyperparameter
 

2219
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:06,470
lambda is is now it's a hyperparameter
right

2220
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:06,480

 

2221
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,270

and I want to make sure that well the

2222
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:09,280
and I want to make sure that well the
 

2223
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,030
and I want to make sure that well the
hyperparameter might will actually

2224
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,040
hyperparameter might will actually
 

2225
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,150
hyperparameter might will actually
affect my solution. So if I was the best

2226
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:14,160
affect my solution. So if I was the best
 

2227
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,790
affect my solution. So if I was the best
student and I wanted to find the best

2228
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:16,800
student and I wanted to find the best
 

2229
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,990
student and I wanted to find the best
hyperparameter what would I do?

2230
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,000
hyperparameter what would I do?
 

2231
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,270
hyperparameter what would I do?
I would try them all.

2232
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280
I would try them all.
 

2233
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,750
I would try them all.
Right? And then we could have the entire

2234
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:25,760
Right? And then we could have the entire
 

2235
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,990
Right? And then we could have the entire
class trying all of the hyperparameters

2236
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,000
class trying all of the hyperparameters
 

2237
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,230
class trying all of the hyperparameters
and that that would be it. But it's

2238
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:30,240
and that that would be it. But it's
 

2239
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,309
and that that would be it. But it's
clearly in feasible even for this simple

2240
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:32,319
clearly in feasible even for this simple
 

2241
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,069
clearly in feasible even for this simple
situation, right? To try all of the

2242
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:34,079
situation, right? To try all of the
 

2243
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,190
situation, right? To try all of the
hyperparameters. So hyperparameter

2244
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:37,200
hyperparameters. So hyperparameter
 

2245
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,430
hyperparameters. So hyperparameter
search is now

2246
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:39,440
search is now
 

2247
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,630
search is now
an extremely becomes becomes a problem.

2248
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
an extremely becomes becomes a problem.
 

2249
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,390
an extremely becomes becomes a problem.
Um and how do we find this? And the

2250
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:44,400
Um and how do we find this? And the
 

2251
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,549
Um and how do we find this? And the
thing is that lambda you know you might

2252
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:46,559
thing is that lambda you know you might
 

2253
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,470
thing is that lambda you know you might
have not have qualitative differences in

2254
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:48,480
have not have qualitative differences in
 

2255
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,589
have not have qualitative differences in
the solution for different sorry let me

2256
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:51,599
the solution for different sorry let me
 

2257
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,670
the solution for different sorry let me
restate that

2258
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,680
restate that
 

2259
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,829
restate that
lambdas and hyperparameters typically

2260
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:55,839
lambdas and hyperparameters typically
 

2261
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,069
lambdas and hyperparameters typically
vary or the order of magnitude of this

2262
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:58,079
vary or the order of magnitude of this
 

2263
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,430
vary or the order of magnitude of this
hyperparameter is typically what

2264
00:50:59,430 --> 00:50:59,440
hyperparameter is typically what
 

2265
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,589
hyperparameter is typically what
matters. So when you're doing a

2266
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:01,599
matters. So when you're doing a
 

2267
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,270
matters. So when you're doing a
hyperparameter search, often you're not

2268
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:03,280
hyperparameter search, often you're not
 

2269
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,710
hyperparameter search, often you're not
going to actually look at every single

2270
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:04,720
going to actually look at every single
 

2271
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,990
going to actually look at every single
lambda, but you're going to look at

2272
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,000
lambda, but you're going to look at
 

2273
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,549
lambda, but you're going to look at
different orders of magnitude. Um, and

2274
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:08,559
different orders of magnitude. Um, and
 

2275
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:09,990
different orders of magnitude. Um, and
you're going to try to do a sweep over

2276
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,000
you're going to try to do a sweep over
 

2277
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,030
you're going to try to do a sweep over
that. But even that is often, you know,

2278
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:13,040
that. But even that is often, you know,
 

2279
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,109
that. But even that is often, you know,
can be too hard to do. When you're doing

2280
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:15,119
can be too hard to do. When you're doing
 

2281
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,470
can be too hard to do. When you're doing
this, typically what you're going to do

2282
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:16,480
this, typically what you're going to do
 

2283
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,750
this, typically what you're going to do
is you're going to have a set of

2284
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:17,760
is you're going to have a set of
 

2285
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,750
is you're going to have a set of
validation data that you're going to

2286
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:19,760
validation data that you're going to
 

2287
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,270
validation data that you're going to
keep separate. So this is your training

2288
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:21,280
keep separate. So this is your training
 

2289
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,430
keep separate. So this is your training
data, you have your validation data, and

2290
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:23,440
data, you have your validation data, and
 

2291
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,349
data, you have your validation data, and
then you have your test data. This

2292
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:25,359
then you have your test data. This
 

2293
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,190
then you have your test data. This
validation data is what you're going to

2294
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,200
validation data is what you're going to
 

2295
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,069
validation data is what you're going to
use to say well I trained my model on my

2296
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
use to say well I trained my model on my
 

2297
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,470
use to say well I trained my model on my
training data. Let me now validate my

2298
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:32,480
training data. Let me now validate my
 

2299
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,670
training data. Let me now validate my
model by looking at uh how different

2300
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:35,680
model by looking at uh how different
 

2301
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,710
model by looking at uh how different
hyperparameters are behaving uh on the

2302
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:38,720
hyperparameters are behaving uh on the
 

2303
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,790
hyperparameters are behaving uh on the
validation data. And then I have my test

2304
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:40,800
validation data. And then I have my test
 

2305
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,109
validation data. And then I have my test
data which is kind of my what I'm going

2306
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:43,119
data which is kind of my what I'm going
 

2307
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,750
data which is kind of my what I'm going
to use for my uh generalization

2308
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:45,760
to use for my uh generalization
 

2309
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,390
to use for my uh generalization
performance. Right?

2310
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:48,400
performance. Right?
 

2311
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,430
performance. Right?
So this this makes sense. But in reality

2312
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
So this this makes sense. But in reality
 

2313
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,589
So this this makes sense. But in reality
when you come to deep learning you don't

2314
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:53,599
when you come to deep learning you don't
 

2315
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,270
when you come to deep learning you don't
have just this one hyperparameter like

2316
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,280
have just this one hyperparameter like
 

2317
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,109
have just this one hyperparameter like
you have in ridge and even in ridge

2318
00:51:57,109 --> 00:51:57,119
you have in ridge and even in ridge
 

2319
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,390
you have in ridge and even in ridge
identifying the hyperparameter you

2320
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:58,400
identifying the hyperparameter you
 

2321
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,349
identifying the hyperparameter you
cannot try them all right. So you have

2322
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:01,359
cannot try them all right. So you have
 

2323
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,109
cannot try them all right. So you have
too many hyperparameters when you're

2324
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:03,119
too many hyperparameters when you're
 

2325
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,270
too many hyperparameters when you're
thinking about deep learning problems.

2326
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,280
thinking about deep learning problems.
 

2327
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,549
thinking about deep learning problems.
So that's a key problem that again we

2328
00:52:08,549 --> 00:52:08,559
So that's a key problem that again we
 

2329
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,390
So that's a key problem that again we
don't really know how to solve. So we've

2330
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:10,400
don't really know how to solve. So we've
 

2331
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,510
don't really know how to solve. So we've
solved you know we solved the

2332
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520
solved you know we solved the
 

2333
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,630
solved you know we solved the
overfitting problems regular

2334
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:12,640
overfitting problems regular
 

2335
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,630
overfitting problems regular
regularization but now we've introduced

2336
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:14,640
regularization but now we've introduced
 

2337
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,309
regularization but now we've introduced
this new problem of hyperparameter

2338
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:16,319
this new problem of hyperparameter
 

2339
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,430
this new problem of hyperparameter
search. And so there's a couple of you

2340
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:19,440
search. And so there's a couple of you
 

2341
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,230
search. And so there's a couple of you
know things that we can do here but this

2342
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:22,240
know things that we can do here but this
 

2343
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,349
know things that we can do here but this
is the new problem

2344
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:27,359

 

2345
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:36,230

is hyperparameter search.

2346
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:36,240

 

2347
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,150

Okay.

2348
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:38,160
Okay.
 

2349
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,069
Okay.
And there's a couple of standard

2350
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:40,079
And there's a couple of standard
 

2351
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,829
And there's a couple of standard
solutions that you kind of use. The

2352
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:41,839
solutions that you kind of use. The
 

2353
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,710
solutions that you kind of use. The
first is that you use um let's say you

2354
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:44,720
first is that you use um let's say you
 

2355
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,309
first is that you use um let's say you
just try to take all of your

2356
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:46,319
just try to take all of your
 

2357
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,950
just try to take all of your
hyperparameters and scale them together.

2358
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:48,960
hyperparameters and scale them together.
 

2359
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,470
hyperparameters and scale them together.
You kind of couple them together so that

2360
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:50,480
You kind of couple them together so that
 

2361
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,270
You kind of couple them together so that
you pick what just picking by picking

2362
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:53,280
you pick what just picking by picking
 

2363
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,790
you pick what just picking by picking
different scalings you're varying all of

2364
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:54,800
different scalings you're varying all of
 

2365
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,150
different scalings you're varying all of
the hyperparameters at the same time.

2366
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:56,160
the hyperparameters at the same time.
 

2367
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,510
the hyperparameters at the same time.
And so you limit your search pace.

2368
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:57,520
And so you limit your search pace.
 

2369
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,030
And so you limit your search pace.
You're not taking every hyperparameter

2370
00:52:59,030 --> 00:52:59,040
You're not taking every hyperparameter
 

2371
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,230
You're not taking every hyperparameter
and doing um a crazy amount of search uh

2372
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,240
and doing um a crazy amount of search uh
 

2373
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,069
and doing um a crazy amount of search uh
on it. So how should I write that? I

2374
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
on it. So how should I write that? I
 

2375
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,630
on it. So how should I write that? I
should say scale

2376
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:06,640
should say scale
 

2377
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,270
should say scale
hyper

2378
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:09,280
hyper
 

2379
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,870
hyper
parameters.

2380
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:12,880

 

2381
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,829

Uh

2382
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:15,839
Uh
 

2383
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,069
Uh
together,

2384
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,079
together,
 

2385
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,270
together,
couple them.

2386
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:23,280

 

2387
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,430

The other option that you have basically

2388
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:25,440
The other option that you have basically
 

2389
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,829
The other option that you have basically
is to say well I think Alan likes to

2390
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:27,839
is to say well I think Alan likes to
 

2391
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,470
is to say well I think Alan likes to
call it be superstitious.

2392
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:30,480
call it be superstitious.
 

2393
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,349
call it be superstitious.
um which basically says look at what

2394
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:33,359
um which basically says look at what
 

2395
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,470
um which basically says look at what
people have done before and look at the

2396
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,480
people have done before and look at the
 

2397
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,790
people have done before and look at the
paper that you're building on. Look at

2398
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:38,800
paper that you're building on. Look at
 

2399
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,630
paper that you're building on. Look at
whatever the default parameter was. Um

2400
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:42,640
whatever the default parameter was. Um
 

2401
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,630
whatever the default parameter was. Um
what did the people who just did the

2402
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:44,640
what did the people who just did the
 

2403
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,470
what did the people who just did the
work before you do it? Just copy exactly

2404
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:46,480
work before you do it? Just copy exactly
 

2405
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,190
work before you do it? Just copy exactly
that it worked for them. Hopefully it'll

2406
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:49,200
that it worked for them. Hopefully it'll
 

2407
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,790
that it worked for them. Hopefully it'll
work for you. And if you can't find

2408
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
work for you. And if you can't find
 

2409
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,309
work for you. And if you can't find
something that matches exactly what you

2410
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:52,319
something that matches exactly what you
 

2411
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,790
something that matches exactly what you
were doing, find the closest thing and

2412
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:54,800
were doing, find the closest thing and
 

2413
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,710
were doing, find the closest thing and
then use their hyperparameters. Right?

2414
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:56,720
then use their hyperparameters. Right?
 

2415
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,030
then use their hyperparameters. Right?
So basically use

2416
00:53:59,030 --> 00:53:59,040
So basically use
 

2417
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:05,349
So basically use
what other people did.

2418
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:05,359

 

2419
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,589

>> Yes. Question.

2420
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:07,599
>> Yes. Question.
 

2421
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,750
>> Yes. Question.
It seems like we really enjoy

2422
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:09,760
It seems like we really enjoy
 

2423
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,230
It seems like we really enjoy
understanding our data and generalizing

2424
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:12,240
understanding our data and generalizing
 

2425
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,950
understanding our data and generalizing
and so I'm wondering if a better

2426
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:16,960
and so I'm wondering if a better
 

2427
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,270
and so I'm wondering if a better
machine learning models that optimize

2428
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:21,280
machine learning models that optimize
 

2429
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:26,470
machine learning models that optimize
meaning

2430
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:26,480

 

2431
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,510

these like the lambda like alpha beta

2432
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:29,520
these like the lambda like alpha beta
 

2433
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,270
these like the lambda like alpha beta
values change over time as the model's

2434
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:31,280
values change over time as the model's
 

2435
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,069
values change over time as the model's
learning and the best way to learn needs

2436
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:34,079
learning and the best way to learn needs
 

2437
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,990
learning and the best way to learn needs
to be found through gradient descent.

2438
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,000
to be found through gradient descent.
 

2439
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,309
to be found through gradient descent.
Does that exist like are there meta

2440
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:38,319
Does that exist like are there meta
 

2441
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:38,950
Does that exist like are there meta
machine learning?

2442
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
machine learning?
 

2443
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,990
machine learning?
>> Yes, this is Do you want to take that

2444
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,000
>> Yes, this is Do you want to take that
 

2445
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,030
>> Yes, this is Do you want to take that
question?

2446
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,040
question?
 

2447
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,510
question?
>> Um, yeah. So, there's a lot of work on

2448
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:43,520
>> Um, yeah. So, there's a lot of work on
 

2449
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,750
>> Um, yeah. So, there's a lot of work on
how you set hyper is a big problem. So,

2450
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:45,760
how you set hyper is a big problem. So,
 

2451
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,270
how you set hyper is a big problem. So,
there are learning methods that people

2452
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:47,280
there are learning methods that people
 

2453
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,870
there are learning methods that people
use to try to set them. That's better

2454
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:48,880
use to try to set them. That's better
 

2455
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,950
use to try to set them. That's better
than uh so talk about when you can't

2456
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:52,960
than uh so talk about when you can't
 

2457
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,750
than uh so talk about when you can't
search. So, first is

2458
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:55,760
search. So, first is
 

2459
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,470
search. So, first is
you can search dumbly, you can then

2460
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:58,480
you can search dumbly, you can then
 

2461
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,230
you can search dumbly, you can then
search intelligently. There's a whole

2462
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:00,240
search intelligently. There's a whole
 

2463
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,230
search intelligently. There's a whole
range of how to search intelligently.

2464
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:02,240
range of how to search intelligently.
 

2465
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,150
range of how to search intelligently.
It's important to do dumb search well

2466
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,160
It's important to do dumb search well
 

2467
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,750
It's important to do dumb search well
too. So for doing dumb search, well the

2468
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:07,760
too. So for doing dumb search, well the
 

2469
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,150
too. So for doing dumb search, well the
dumbest of dumb search is you drop down

2470
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:10,160
dumbest of dumb search is you drop down
 

2471
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,870
dumbest of dumb search is you drop down
a grid over all your hyperparameters,

2472
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:12,880
a grid over all your hyperparameters,
 

2473
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,430
a grid over all your hyperparameters,
scale them on a log scale um for

2474
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,440
scale them on a log scale um for
 

2475
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,910
scale them on a log scale um for
appropriate appropriate scaling and just

2476
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:17,920
appropriate appropriate scaling and just
 

2477
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,710
appropriate appropriate scaling and just
sample in this grid uh on a regular grid

2478
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:20,720
sample in this grid uh on a regular grid
 

2479
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,390
sample in this grid uh on a regular grid
and evaluate everywhere. Cursive

2480
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:22,400
and evaluate everywhere. Cursive
 

2481
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,870
and evaluate everywhere. Cursive
dimensionality kills you there. Then

2482
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:24,880
dimensionality kills you there. Then
 

2483
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,870
dimensionality kills you there. Then
there's the next dump approach which is

2484
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:26,880
there's the next dump approach which is
 

2485
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,950
there's the next dump approach which is
important to recognize is instead of

2486
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:28,960
important to recognize is instead of
 

2487
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,190
important to recognize is instead of
searching that grid by exhaustive

2488
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:31,200
searching that grid by exhaustive
 

2489
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,309
searching that grid by exhaustive
search, do random sampling.

2490
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:34,319
search, do random sampling.
 

2491
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,309
search, do random sampling.
randomly draw things inside that grid

2492
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:36,319
randomly draw things inside that grid
 

2493
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,910
randomly draw things inside that grid
with an appropriate distribution and

2494
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920
with an appropriate distribution and
 

2495
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,910
with an appropriate distribution and
then pick the best one. I can afford to

2496
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:39,920
then pick the best one. I can afford to
 

2497
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,549
then pick the best one. I can afford to
do this many hyperparameter tests, draw

2498
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:42,559
do this many hyperparameter tests, draw
 

2499
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,670
do this many hyperparameter tests, draw
that many samples. This this is better.

2500
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:45,680
that many samples. This this is better.
 

2501
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,190
that many samples. This this is better.
Okay. Then after that comes what you're

2502
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:49,200
Okay. Then after that comes what you're
 

2503
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,510
Okay. Then after that comes what you're
talking about is more intelligent ways

2504
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:51,520
talking about is more intelligent ways
 

2505
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,670
talking about is more intelligent ways
of doing the sampling and possibly doing

2506
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:53,680
of doing the sampling and possibly doing
 

2507
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,950
of doing the sampling and possibly doing
adaptive sampling there to do search.

2508
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:56,960
adaptive sampling there to do search.
 

2509
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,030
adaptive sampling there to do search.
All of that is hyperparameter search

2510
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,040
All of that is hyperparameter search
 

2511
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,589
All of that is hyperparameter search
when you can afford to do the search.

2512
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:01,599
when you can afford to do the search.
 

2513
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,349
when you can afford to do the search.
Then comes the problem of you can't

2514
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:03,359
Then comes the problem of you can't
 

2515
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,910
Then comes the problem of you can't
afford even that much and that's where

2516
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:05,920
afford even that much and that's where
 

2517
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,349
afford even that much and that's where
what's being talked about here comes in

2518
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:07,359
what's being talked about here comes in
 

2519
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,109
what's being talked about here comes in
which is the reality that every one of

2520
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:09,119
which is the reality that every one of
 

2521
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,630
which is the reality that every one of
you will face and everyone in practice

2522
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
you will face and everyone in practice
 

2523
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,910
you will face and everyone in practice
faces all the time

2524
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:13,920
faces all the time
 

2525
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,750
faces all the time
other questions

2526
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:17,760

 

2527
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,910

okay

2528
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
okay
 

2529
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,870
okay
so with this now I want to say okay so

2530
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:22,880
so with this now I want to say okay so
 

2531
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,150
so with this now I want to say okay so
clearly we have established that

2532
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:24,160
clearly we have established that
 

2533
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,430
clearly we have established that
optimization matters um so let's talk

2534
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,440
optimization matters um so let's talk
 

2535
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,030
optimization matters um so let's talk
about optimization and what is the

2536
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,040
about optimization and what is the
 

2537
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,950
about optimization and what is the
optimizer that we are going to be using

2538
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:30,960
optimizer that we are going to be using
 

2539
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,910
optimizer that we are going to be using
for most of our time

2540
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:35,920

 

2541
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,549

well it's going to be gradient descent

2542
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:38,559
well it's going to be gradient descent
 

2543
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,789
well it's going to be gradient descent
or some variation on gradient descent

2544
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:40,799
or some variation on gradient descent
 

2545
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,990
or some variation on gradient descent
okay so here what are we trying to do

2546
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:44,000
okay so here what are we trying to do
 

2547
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,630
okay so here what are we trying to do
let's say I have my loss function my uh

2548
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:46,640
let's say I have my loss function my uh
 

2549
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,390
let's say I have my loss function my uh
this is um I have my y

2550
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,400
this is um I have my y
 

2551
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,910
this is um I have my y
f theta of x

2552
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:53,920
f theta of x
 

2553
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,670
f theta of x
and I'm going to just rewrite this maybe

2554
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:55,680
and I'm going to just rewrite this maybe
 

2555
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,870
and I'm going to just rewrite this maybe
as the loss and explicitly call out this

2556
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:58,880
as the loss and explicitly call out this
 

2557
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,470
as the loss and explicitly call out this
parameter theta theta um

2558
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:02,480
parameter theta theta um
 

2559
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,870
parameter theta theta um
x train

2560
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:04,880
x train
 

2561
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,870
x train
y train. Okay,

2562
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:08,880
y train. Okay,
 

2563
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,510
y train. Okay,
gradient descent says okay let me try to

2564
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:11,520
gradient descent says okay let me try to
 

2565
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,230
gradient descent says okay let me try to
now use

2566
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:14,240
now use
 

2567
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,870
now use
a step every single time to get a better

2568
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:16,880
a step every single time to get a better
 

2569
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,349
a step every single time to get a better
and better estimate of what my parameter

2570
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:19,359
and better estimate of what my parameter
 

2571
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,870
and better estimate of what my parameter
theta is. So I say I start at some theta

2572
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:22,880
theta is. So I say I start at some theta
 

2573
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:29,990
theta is. So I say I start at some theta
kn. This is my initial condition

2574
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,000

 

2575
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,630

and then I write theta t + 1 is given by

2576
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:34,640
and then I write theta t + 1 is given by
 

2577
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,109
and then I write theta t + 1 is given by
the gradient descent update

2578
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:37,119
the gradient descent update
 

2579
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,150
the gradient descent update
theta times the gradient with respect to

2580
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:40,160
theta times the gradient with respect to
 

2581
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,829
theta times the gradient with respect to
theta

2582
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:41,839
theta
 

2583
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:53,030
theta
of my loss function.

2584
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,040

 

2585
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,230

theta

2586
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:56,240

 

2587
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,910

um

2588
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920

 

2589
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,270

okay so here basically I'm saying that

2590
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,280
okay so here basically I'm saying that
 

2591
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,030
okay so here basically I'm saying that
this is where my next step is this is

2592
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:07,040
this is where my next step is this is
 

2593
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,349
this is where my next step is this is
where I currently am

2594
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:09,359
where I currently am
 

2595
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,750
where I currently am
here is my learning rate

2596
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:11,760
here is my learning rate
 

2597
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,670
here is my learning rate
and this is my gradient so I'm going to

2598
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,680
and this is my gradient so I'm going to
 

2599
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,510
and this is my gradient so I'm going to
take a step of the size um of given by

2600
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:17,520
take a step of the size um of given by
 

2601
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,190
take a step of the size um of given by
my learning rate in the direction of my

2602
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:19,200
my learning rate in the direction of my
 

2603
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,710
my learning rate in the direction of my
negative gradient. Okay.

2604
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:22,720
negative gradient. Okay.
 

2605
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,309
negative gradient. Okay.
So now a whole lot of stuff that we do

2606
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:26,319
So now a whole lot of stuff that we do
 

2607
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:29,190
So now a whole lot of stuff that we do
comes from the possibilities and the

2608
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:29,200
comes from the possibilities and the
 

2609
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,870
comes from the possibilities and the
limitations that are introduced by

2610
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
limitations that are introduced by
 

2611
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,870
limitations that are introduced by
gradient descent because gradient

2612
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:32,880
gradient descent because gradient
 

2613
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,870
gradient descent because gradient
descent or stoastic gradient descent or

2614
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:34,880
descent or stoastic gradient descent or
 

2615
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,270
descent or stoastic gradient descent or
the variations thereof are our

2616
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:37,280
the variations thereof are our
 

2617
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,030
the variations thereof are our
optimizers of choice. The fact that we

2618
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:39,040
optimizers of choice. The fact that we
 

2619
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,789
optimizers of choice. The fact that we
can implement these efficiently and

2620
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:40,799
can implement these efficiently and
 

2621
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:43,990
can implement these efficiently and
quickly um the fact that we can do back

2622
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:44,000
quickly um the fact that we can do back
 

2623
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,190
quickly um the fact that we can do back
propagation is what enables everything

2624
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:47,200
propagation is what enables everything
 

2625
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,710
propagation is what enables everything
right. So understanding gradient descent

2626
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:50,720
right. So understanding gradient descent
 

2627
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,150
right. So understanding gradient descent
fundamentally helps us understand what

2628
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,160
fundamentally helps us understand what
 

2629
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,390
fundamentally helps us understand what
are the possibilities and limitations in

2630
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:56,400
are the possibilities and limitations in
 

2631
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,990
are the possibilities and limitations in
general for training gradient descent.

2632
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
general for training gradient descent.
 

2633
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,589
general for training gradient descent.
Right?

2634
00:58:59,589 --> 00:58:59,599
Right?
 

2635
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,430
Right?
So what we're going to do today is we're

2636
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:01,440
So what we're going to do today is we're
 

2637
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,670
So what we're going to do today is we're
going to think about basically gradient

2638
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:03,680
going to think about basically gradient
 

2639
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,670
going to think about basically gradient
descent and some brothers and sisters of

2640
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:07,680
descent and some brothers and sisters of
 

2641
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,309
descent and some brothers and sisters of
gradient descent essentially. So I want

2642
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:10,319
gradient descent essentially. So I want
 

2643
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,430
gradient descent essentially. So I want
to think about this

2644
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:13,440
to think about this
 

2645
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,990
to think about this
specifically for the least squares

2646
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,000
specifically for the least squares
 

2647
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:25,109
specifically for the least squares
problem. So I want to consider

2648
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:25,119

 

2649
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,270

now W is my parameter. I'm just taking

2650
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:27,280
now W is my parameter. I'm just taking
 

2651
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,829
now W is my parameter. I'm just taking
the loss of w and that's just x w

2652
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:31,839
the loss of w and that's just x w
 

2653
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:36,470
the loss of w and that's just x w
minus y. Okay, so there's no regularizer

2654
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:36,480
minus y. Okay, so there's no regularizer
 

2655
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,589
minus y. Okay, so there's no regularizer
here. I'm just trying to find a vector w

2656
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:39,599
here. I'm just trying to find a vector w
 

2657
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,589
here. I'm just trying to find a vector w
such that I can have this linear model

2658
00:59:41,589 --> 00:59:41,599
such that I can have this linear model
 

2659
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,030
such that I can have this linear model
be fit as well as possible. Okay,

2660
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,040
be fit as well as possible. Okay,
 

2661
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,470
be fit as well as possible. Okay,
I know that this is the least squares

2662
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:46,480
I know that this is the least squares
 

2663
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,950
I know that this is the least squares
problem

2664
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:48,960
problem
 

2665
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,030
problem
and I know my optimal solution for this.

2666
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,040
and I know my optimal solution for this.
 

2667
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,309
and I know my optimal solution for this.
I know that my war star is given by

2668
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:54,319
I know that my war star is given by
 

2669
00:59:54,319 --> 01:00:02,309
I know that my war star is given by
xrpose x inverse

2670
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:02,319

 

2671
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,549

xtranspose

2672
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:04,559
xtranspose
 

2673
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,349
xtranspose
y. Okay.

2674
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:07,359
y. Okay.
 

2675
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,109
y. Okay.
And now I can write my gradient descent

2676
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:09,119
And now I can write my gradient descent
 

2677
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,750
And now I can write my gradient descent
update equation. Actually all of you

2678
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:11,760
update equation. Actually all of you
 

2679
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,030
update equation. Actually all of you
write the gradient descent update

2680
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:13,040
write the gradient descent update
 

2681
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,109
write the gradient descent update
equation as a good practice. You'll

2682
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
equation as a good practice. You'll
 

2683
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,870
equation as a good practice. You'll
probably need it in homework zero and

2684
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:16,880
probably need it in homework zero and
 

2685
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,470
probably need it in homework zero and
homework one anyway. So why don't you

2686
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:18,480
homework one anyway. So why don't you
 

2687
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,670
homework one anyway. So why don't you
write the gradient descent update

2688
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:19,680
write the gradient descent update
 

2689
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:37,190
write the gradient descent update
equation?

2690
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:37,200

 

2691
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,470

So for that you have to take the

2692
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:38,480
So for that you have to take the
 

2693
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,910
So for that you have to take the
gradient of

2694
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:41,920

 

2695
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,430

this loss. So what is the gradient of a

2696
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:45,440
this loss. So what is the gradient of a
 

2697
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:51,109
this loss. So what is the gradient of a
squared norm? Anyone?

2698
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:51,119

 

2699
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:57,190

What's the gradient of this guy?

2700
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:57,200

 

2701
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,990

Okay, compute the gradient. Take one

2704
01:01:02,069 --> 01:01:02,079
Okay, compute the gradient. Take one
 

2705
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:07,030
Okay, compute the gradient. Take one
minute. I'll give you one minute.

2706
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:07,040

 

2707
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:17,270

I'll set a timer.

2708
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:17,280

 

2709
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,910

Yes. Question

2710
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:21,920

 

2711
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,710

three

2712
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:24,720
three
 

2713
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,950
three
well on the test but not

2714
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:28,960
well on the test but not
 

2715
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,030
well on the test but not
sorry perform well on the train but not

2716
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:31,040
sorry perform well on the train but not
 

2717
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,549
sorry perform well on the train but not
well on the test data. Is there a

2718
01:01:32,549 --> 01:01:32,559
well on the test data. Is there a
 

2719
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,270
well on the test data. Is there a
possibility that the probability

2720
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:35,280
possibility that the probability
 

2721
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,589
possibility that the probability
distribution of your training data is

2722
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:37,599
distribution of your training data is
 

2723
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,589
distribution of your training data is
not

2724
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:39,599
not
 

2725
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,069
not
close enough to the past data?

2726
01:01:42,069 --> 01:01:42,079
close enough to the past data?
 

2727
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:43,910
close enough to the past data?
>> Yeah, that's that's entirely possible,

2728
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:43,920
>> Yeah, that's that's entirely possible,
 

2729
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,589
>> Yeah, that's that's entirely possible,
right? And so there's a lot of different

2730
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:45,599
right? And so there's a lot of different
 

2731
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,270
right? And so there's a lot of different
problems that you can that can show up

2732
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:47,280
problems that you can that can show up
 

2733
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,430
problems that you can that can show up
of this form. One of the key like this

2734
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:51,440
of this form. One of the key like this
 

2735
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,030
of this form. One of the key like this
is called basically out of distribution

2736
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:53,040
is called basically out of distribution
 

2737
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,870
is called basically out of distribution
data when your test data is out of the

2738
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:54,880
data when your test data is out of the
 

2739
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,309
data when your test data is out of the
distribution of the training data. And

2740
01:01:56,309 --> 01:01:56,319
distribution of the training data. And
 

2741
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:57,510
distribution of the training data. And
that's kind of like this example where

2742
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:57,520
that's kind of like this example where
 

2743
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,789
that's kind of like this example where
you train on cats and dogs and then

2744
01:01:58,789 --> 01:01:58,799
you train on cats and dogs and then
 

2745
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:03,670
you train on cats and dogs and then
you're trying to classify dinosaurs.

2746
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:03,680

 

2747
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,069

smart way to tell if these two

2748
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:06,079
smart way to tell if these two
 

2749
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,910
smart way to tell if these two
distributions are the same or close

2750
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:07,920
distributions are the same or close
 

2751
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,710
distributions are the same or close
enough.

2752
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:08,720
enough.
 

2753
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,430
enough.
>> So definitely yes. So there is

2754
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
>> So definitely yes. So there is
 

2755
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,270
>> So definitely yes. So there is
definitely you can do things that you

2756
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:13,280
definitely you can do things that you
 

2757
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,349
definitely you can do things that you
will try to estimate the density of what

2758
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:15,359
will try to estimate the density of what
 

2759
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:19,670
will try to estimate the density of what
your your test data is. You will try to

2760
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:19,680
your your test data is. You will try to
 

2761
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,190
your your test data is. You will try to
um

2762
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:21,200
um
 

2763
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,950
um
uh sometimes you can try to create

2764
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:22,960
uh sometimes you can try to create
 

2765
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,549
uh sometimes you can try to create
samples that are from this from the if

2766
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:26,559
samples that are from this from the if
 

2767
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,990
samples that are from this from the if
if you have a sense of what the estimate

2768
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:28,000
if you have a sense of what the estimate
 

2769
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,430
if you have a sense of what the estimate
of your test data is you can try to

2770
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,440
of your test data is you can try to
 

2771
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,990
of your test data is you can try to
create samples generate samples either

2772
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,000
create samples generate samples either
 

2773
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,549
create samples generate samples either
come up with labels for those uh or

2774
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:34,559
come up with labels for those uh or
 

2775
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,470
come up with labels for those uh or
acquire data uh there's this is a huge

2776
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:38,480
acquire data uh there's this is a huge
 

2777
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,150
acquire data uh there's this is a huge
huge area of research is how to handle

2778
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:40,160
huge area of research is how to handle
 

2779
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,150
huge area of research is how to handle
this kind of out of distribution area

2780
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:42,160
this kind of out of distribution area
 

2781
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,589
this kind of out of distribution area
how to out of distribution data

how to out of distribution data
Okay. So now in that one minute everyone

2784
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:50,000
Okay. So now in that one minute everyone
 

2785
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,589
Okay. So now in that one minute everyone
else

2789
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:02,870

of this

2790
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:02,880

 

2791
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,990

>> very good right okay so make sure you

2792
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,000
>> very good right okay so make sure you
 

2793
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,470
>> very good right okay so make sure you
know how to do this so with this we can

2794
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:08,480
know how to do this so with this we can
 

2795
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:21,270
know how to do this so with this we can
write this gradient update

2796

2797
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,549

Okay.

2798
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:24,559

 

2799
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,270

And I'm just going to So this is a WT

2800
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:27,280
And I'm just going to So this is a WT
 

2801

here
and I'm just going to rearrange this to

2804
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:31,440
and I'm just going to rearrange this to
 

2805
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,789
and I'm just going to rearrange this to
write this as identity.

2817
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,349
Y right
so now what I see here is that I have a

2818
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:55,359
so now what I see here is that I have a
 

2819
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:58,069
so now what I see here is that I have a
recurrence relation

2820
01:03:58,069 --> 01:03:58,079
recurrence relation
 

2821
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,910
recurrence relation
on my WTS right that's the weight and so

2822
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:01,920
on my WTS right that's the weight and so
 

2823
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,670
on my WTS right that's the weight and so
what do I know about these kinds of

2824
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:03,680
what do I know about these kinds of
 

2825
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,150
what do I know about these kinds of
recurrence relations what matters here

2826
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:06,160
recurrence relations what matters here
 

2827
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,670
recurrence relations what matters here
in terms of so what do I want this

2828
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:07,680
in terms of so what do I want this
 

2829
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,510
in terms of so what do I want this
gradient descent to do first what what

2830
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:09,520
gradient descent to do first what what
 

2831
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,589
gradient descent to do first what what
is the ideal behavior for this gradient

2832
01:04:11,589 --> 01:04:11,599
is the ideal behavior for this gradient
 

2833
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,270
is the ideal behavior for this gradient

01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:31,520
converge to a solution and so I want to
 

2845
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,750
converge to a solution and so I want to

01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,710
I want to do what matters for the
convergence of this given that I have

2850
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:38,720
convergence of this given that I have
 

2851
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,630
convergence of this given that I have
this matrix here that is dominating how

2852
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:40,640
this matrix here that is dominating how
 

2853
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:46,150
this matrix here that is dominating how
my iterates are evolving

2854
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:46,160

 

2855
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,990

this matrix is what is the key thing

2856
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:48,000
this matrix is what is the key thing
 

2857
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,789
this matrix is what is the key thing
right and in fact I can think about this

2858
01:04:50,789 --> 01:04:50,799
right and in fact I can think about this
 

2859
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,789
right and in fact I can think about this
I can specifically think about this as

2860
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:52,799
I can specifically think about this as
 

2861
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,190
I can specifically think about this as
let's say I know wt minus one I can look

2862
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:55,200
let's say I know wt minus one I can look
 

2863
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,549
let's say I know wt minus one I can look
at it as the distance to my optimal so I

2864
01:04:58,549 --> 01:04:58,559
at it as the distance to my optimal so I
 

2865
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,549
at it as the distance to my optimal so I
know that my optimal here is given by

2866
01:05:00,549 --> 01:05:00,559
know that my optimal here is given by
 

2867
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:01,829
know that my optimal here is given by
this so I can instead of just thinking

2868
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:01,839
this so I can instead of just thinking
 

2869
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,430
this so I can instead of just thinking
about conversion I can think

2870
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:03,440
about conversion I can think
 

2871
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,029
about conversion I can think
specifically in the case of le squares I

2872
01:05:05,029 --> 01:05:05,039
specifically in the case of le squares I
 

2873
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:07,589
specifically in the case of le squares I
can say how fast am I conversing to w

2874
01:05:07,589 --> 01:05:07,599
can say how fast am I conversing to w
 

2875
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,430
can say how fast am I conversing to w
and I can subtract war star from both

2876
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
and I can subtract war star from both
 

2877
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,950
and I can subtract war star from both
sides.

2878
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:10,960
sides.
 

2879
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,829
sides.
This gives me i - 2 x

2880
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:15,839
This gives me i - 2 x
 

2881
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:22,950
This gives me i - 2 x
wt.

2882
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:22,960

 

2883
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,230

Okay.

2884
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:26,240

 

2885
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,069

So I'm not going to you know in the

2886
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:28,079
So I'm not going to you know in the
 

2887
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,230
So I'm not going to you know in the
interest of time and this you've all

2888
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:30,240
interest of time and this you've all
 

2889
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,150
interest of time and this you've all
seen before.

2890
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:32,160
seen before.
 

2891
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:40,230
seen before.
This I can just write as

2892
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:40,240

 

2893
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,190

okay just grouping some terms

2894
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:43,200
okay just grouping some terms
 

2895
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,109
okay just grouping some terms
you can rewrite this also in terms of

2896
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
you can rewrite this also in terms of
 

2897
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,870
you can rewrite this also in terms of
war star

2898
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:46,880
war star
 

2899
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,910
war star
and I get this evolution.

2900
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:49,920
and I get this evolution.
 

2901
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,390
and I get this evolution.
So this thing here

2902
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:52,400
So this thing here
 

2903
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,430
So this thing here
this is a vector.

2904
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:55,440
this is a vector.
 

2905
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,349
this is a vector.
What is this?

2906
01:05:59,349 --> 01:05:59,359

 

2907
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:00,710

What kind of object is this? What are

2908
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:00,720
What kind of object is this? What are
 

2909
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,349
What kind of object is this? What are
the shapes of this?

2910
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:03,359
the shapes of this?
 

2911
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,870
the shapes of this?
Is this a vector? It's a matrix. Right?

2912
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:06,880
Is this a vector? It's a matrix. Right?
 

2913
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,190
Is this a vector? It's a matrix. Right?
So now if I want to try and understand

2914
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:09,200
So now if I want to try and understand
 

2915
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,710
So now if I want to try and understand
how

2916
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:10,720
how
 

2917
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,589
how
this vector so what I want this thing to

2918
01:06:13,589 --> 01:06:13,599
this vector so what I want this thing to
 

2919
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:17,829
this vector so what I want this thing to
go to zero.

2920
01:06:17,829 --> 01:06:17,839

 

2921
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:19,430

I want to converge to my optimal

2922
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:19,440
I want to converge to my optimal
 

2923
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,150
I want to converge to my optimal
solution. What do I need to think about

2924
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,160
solution. What do I need to think about
 

2925
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:26,470
solution. What do I need to think about
of this matrix to be able to

2926
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:26,480
of this matrix to be able to
 

2927
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,109
of this matrix to be able to
say anything about whether this is going

2928
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:29,119
say anything about whether this is going
 

2929
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,870
say anything about whether this is going
to converge or not converge? What's the

2930
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:30,880
to converge or not converge? What's the
 

2931
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,270
to converge or not converge? What's the
key thing?

2932
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:33,280
key thing?
 

2933
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,910
key thing?
Yeah, just start it out. Just

2934
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:35,920
Yeah, just start it out. Just
 

2935
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,150
Yeah, just start it out. Just
>> it's values, right? So, what do I need

2936
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:38,160
>> it's values, right? So, what do I need
 

2937
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,910
>> it's values, right? So, what do I need
to check for the IGEN values of this

2938
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:39,920
to check for the IGEN values of this
 

2939
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,230
to check for the IGEN values of this
thing?

2940
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:42,240
thing?
 

2941
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,510
thing?
This everyone should know this. Just

2942
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:43,520
This everyone should know this. Just
 

2943
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,789
This everyone should know this. Just
just Yeah, I just want to make sure that

2944
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:44,799
just Yeah, I just want to make sure that
 

2945
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:46,630
just Yeah, I just want to make sure that
you're all with me. The whole room

2946
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:46,640
you're all with me. The whole room
 

2947
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,069
you're all with me. The whole room
should resoundingly

2948
01:06:50,069 --> 01:06:50,079
should resoundingly
 

2949
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,390
should resoundingly
speak up. The more of you speak up, the

2950
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:52,400
speak up. The more of you speak up, the
 

2951
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,789
speak up. The more of you speak up, the
less likely your own voice is heard.

2952
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:54,799
less likely your own voice is heard.
 

2953
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:57,510
less likely your own voice is heard.
>> So there's

2954
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:57,520
>> So there's
 

2955
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,349
>> So there's

2957
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:04,150
>> you know this you know this whatever is
your gut is correct. Just say it.

2958
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:04,160

 

2959
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,510

>> Interesting. They're saying the

2960
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:05,520
>> Interesting. They're saying the
 

2961
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,309
>> Interesting. They're saying the
continuous case.

2962
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:06,319
continuous case.
 

2963
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,390
continuous case.
>> Ah okay.

2964
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:08,400
>> Ah okay.
 

2965
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,789
>> Ah okay.
Okay. So these are discreet. So yes

2966
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
Okay. So these are discreet. So yes
 

2967
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:14,230
Okay. So these are discreet. So yes
there's two cases. So if you

2968
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:14,240
there's two cases. So if you
 

2969
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,390
there's two cases. So if you
um

2970
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:16,400
um
 

2971
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,430
um
so in a discrete setting I want to make

2972
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:19,440
so in a discrete setting I want to make
 

2973
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:26,390
so in a discrete setting I want to make
sure that my igen values are all

2974
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:26,400

 

2975
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,109

less than one small what happens if I 2

2976
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:29,119
less than one small what happens if I 2
 

2977
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,950
less than one small what happens if I 2
* 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 goes to infinity half*

2978
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:32,960
* 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 goes to infinity half*
 

2979
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,710
* 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 goes to infinity half*
half* half* half time half goes to zero

2980
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:36,720
half* half* half time half goes to zero
 

2981
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,470
half* half* half time half goes to zero
right so which one do I want this to be

2982
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:38,480
right so which one do I want this to be
 

2983
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,190
right so which one do I want this to be
like less than one right so I want all

2984
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:41,200
like less than one right so I want all
 

2985
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,069
like less than one right so I want all
of my igen values to be uh to be bounded

2986
01:07:44,069 --> 01:07:44,079
of my igen values to be uh to be bounded
 

2987
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,870
of my igen values to be uh to be bounded
in absolute value. So I want to look at

2988
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:48,880
in absolute value. So I want to look at
 

2989
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,670
in absolute value. So I want to look at
the igen values

2990
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:53,680

 

2991
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,630

of identity minus.

2992
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:58,640
of identity minus.
 

2993
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,670
of identity minus.
Okay.

2994
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:01,680

 

2995
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,430

So what does this tell me now about

2996
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:03,440
So what does this tell me now about
 

2997
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,670
So what does this tell me now about
these values? How can I can I say

2998
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:05,680
these values? How can I can I say
 

2999
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,950
these values? How can I can I say
anything about these values?

3000
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:08,960
anything about these values?
 

3001
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,910
anything about these values?
What kind of matrix is this here?

3002
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:11,920
What kind of matrix is this here?
 

3003
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,589
What kind of matrix is this here?
Identity is a special matrix. What kind

3004
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:13,599
Identity is a special matrix. What kind
 

3005
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,270
Identity is a special matrix. What kind
of matrix is it?

3006
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:15,280
of matrix is it?
 

3007
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,749
of matrix is it?
>> Diagonal. It's also symmetric. What

3008
01:08:17,749 --> 01:08:17,759
>> Diagonal. It's also symmetric. What
 

3009
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,630
>> Diagonal. It's also symmetric. What
about 28 is a scalar xrpose x is also

3010
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:20,640
about 28 is a scalar xrpose x is also
 

3011
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,870
about 28 is a scalar xrpose x is also
symmetric. Right? So this entire matrix

3012
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:22,880
symmetric. Right? So this entire matrix
 

3013
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,349
symmetric. Right? So this entire matrix
that I have here

3014
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:25,359
that I have here
 

3015
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,229
that I have here
is symmetric. Right? And so I know that

3016
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:28,239
is symmetric. Right? And so I know that
 

3017
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:30,070
is symmetric. Right? And so I know that
basically the singular values and the

3018
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:30,080
basically the singular values and the
 

3019
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,950
basically the singular values and the
igen values only differ in sign.

3020
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:32,960
igen values only differ in sign.
 

3021
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,550
igen values only differ in sign.
So that also tells me like again you

3022
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:34,560
So that also tells me like again you
 

3023
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,749
So that also tells me like again you
know I can think about this in terms of

3024
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:35,759
know I can think about this in terms of
 

3025
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,030
know I can think about this in terms of
igen values but I can also just think

3026
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,040
igen values but I can also just think
 

3027
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,470
igen values but I can also just think
about it in terms of singular values

3028
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:38,480
about it in terms of singular values
 

3029
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,829
about it in terms of singular values
doesn't matter because it's symmetric we

3030
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:39,839
doesn't matter because it's symmetric we
 

3031
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,709
doesn't matter because it's symmetric we
can just use igen values for now. So I

3032
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:42,719
can just use igen values for now. So I
 

3033
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,709
can just use igen values for now. So I
want to make sure now that

3034
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:46,719
want to make sure now that
 

3035
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:51,990
want to make sure now that
absolute value of 1 - 2a

3036
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,000
absolute value of 1 - 2a
 

3037
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,550
absolute value of 1 - 2a
times this lambda max

3038
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
times this lambda max
 

3039
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,349
times this lambda max
is less than one. Right? So now if I'm

3040
01:08:59,349 --> 01:08:59,359
is less than one. Right? So now if I'm
 

3041
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:00,709
is less than one. Right? So now if I'm
looking at the igen values of this and

3042
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:00,719
looking at the igen values of this and
 

3043
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,269
looking at the igen values of this and
if I want all of the igen values of this

3044
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:03,279
if I want all of the igen values of this
 

3045
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,229
if I want all of the igen values of this
to be smaller than one, what are the two

3046
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:06,239
to be smaller than one, what are the two
 

3047
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,990
to be smaller than one, what are the two
candidates that I have for being the

3048
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:08,000
candidates that I have for being the
 

3049
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,950
candidates that I have for being the
maximum igen value in terms of the igen

3050
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:10,960
maximum igen value in terms of the igen
 

3051
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:17,510
maximum igen value in terms of the igen
values of xrpose x

3052
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:17,520

 

3053
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,149

I can look at remember there's an

3054
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:20,159
I can look at remember there's an
 

3055
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:22,149
I can look at remember there's an
absolute value here. So I either have to

3056
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:22,159
absolute value here. So I either have to
 

3057
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:25,349
absolute value here. So I either have to
look at the largest igen value or I have

3058
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:25,359
look at the largest igen value or I have
 

3059
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:26,870
look at the largest igen value or I have
to look at the smallest igen value.

3060
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:26,880
to look at the smallest igen value.
 

3061
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,910
to look at the smallest igen value.
Right? The igen values of this are going

3062
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:29,920
Right? The igen values of this are going
 

3063
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,110
Right? The igen values of this are going
to be in between

3064
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:33,120
to be in between
 

3065
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:39,430
to be in between
this and I need 1 - 2 a lambda min to be

3066
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:39,440
this and I need 1 - 2 a lambda min to be
 

3067
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,510
this and I need 1 - 2 a lambda min to be
also less than one. Does this make

3068
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
also less than one. Does this make
 

3069
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,430
also less than one. Does this make
sense?

3070
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:43,440
sense?
 

3071
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,030
sense?
Right? One of these two is going to be

3072
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:45,040
Right? One of these two is going to be
 

3073
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,149
Right? One of these two is going to be
the maximum value.

3074
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:48,159
the maximum value.
 

3075
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:51,430
the maximum value.
And so when I process this through

3076
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:51,440
And so when I process this through
 

3077
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,669
And so when I process this through
actually take one minute and come up

3078
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:53,679
actually take one minute and come up
 

3079
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,709
actually take one minute and come up
with a condition on ADA with this. Do

3080
01:09:56,709 --> 01:09:56,719
with a condition on ADA with this. Do
 

3081
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,870
with a condition on ADA with this. Do
this. Do this algebra. Do this algebra.

3082
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
this. Do this algebra. Do this algebra.
 

3083
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,870
this. Do this algebra. Do this algebra.
I'm not going to do it out. You do it

3084
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:02,880
I'm not going to do it out. You do it
 

3085
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,790
I'm not going to do it out. You do it
because if I write the answer, you won't

3086
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:04,800
because if I write the answer, you won't
 

3087
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:26,630
because if I write the answer, you won't
remember why it's tricky.

3088
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:26,640

 

3089
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,070

So how do you deal with the absolute

3090
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:28,080
So how do you deal with the absolute
 

3091
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,430
So how do you deal with the absolute
value?

3092
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:31,440

 

3093
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,189

That means the absolute value implies

3094
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:33,199
That means the absolute value implies
 

3095
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,630
That means the absolute value implies
two inequalities that you have to

3096
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:34,640
two inequalities that you have to
 

3097
01:10:34,640 --> 01:11:04,229
two inequalities that you have to
satisfy, right? Not just one.

3098
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:04,239

 

3099
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:09,189

Okay. So if I just look at this uh

3100
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:09,199
Okay. So if I just look at this uh
 

3101
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:12,229
Okay. So if I just look at this uh
lambda max equation, I have minus one

3102
01:11:12,229 --> 01:11:12,239
lambda max equation, I have minus one
 

3103
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:16,630
lambda max equation, I have minus one
should be less than 1 minus 2 a lambda

3104
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:16,640
should be less than 1 minus 2 a lambda
 

3105
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,270
should be less than 1 minus 2 a lambda
max. It should also be less than one.

3106
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:21,280
max. It should also be less than one.
 

3107
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,149
max. It should also be less than one.
Which side is trivially satisfied? the

3108
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:24,159
Which side is trivially satisfied? the
 

3109
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,310
Which side is trivially satisfied? the
left hand side inequality is trivial or

3110
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:26,320
left hand side inequality is trivial or
 

3111
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,510
left hand side inequality is trivial or
the right hand side inequality is

3112
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:27,520
the right hand side inequality is
 

3113
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,870
the right hand side inequality is
trivial.

3114
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:30,880

 

3115
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,870

the right hand side, right? Okay, good.

3116
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:32,880
the right hand side, right? Okay, good.
 

3117
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,790
the right hand side, right? Okay, good.
So, this implies that I what I need to

3118
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:34,800
So, this implies that I what I need to
 

3119
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,950
So, this implies that I what I need to
look at I need to have minus 2 less than

3120
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:36,960
look at I need to have minus 2 less than
 

3121
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,950
look at I need to have minus 2 less than
minus

3122
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:38,960
minus
 

3123
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,709
minus
2 ADA lambda max, which implies that I

3124
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:42,719
2 ADA lambda max, which implies that I
 

3125
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,669
2 ADA lambda max, which implies that I
need to have ADA less than one over

3126
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:45,679
need to have ADA less than one over
 

3127
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,750
need to have ADA less than one over
lambda max

3128
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:47,760
lambda max
 

3129
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,510
lambda max
for this thing for this thing to be less

3130
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:49,520
for this thing for this thing to be less
 

3131
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,430
for this thing for this thing to be less
than one. Right? So basically if I

3132
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:51,440
than one. Right? So basically if I
 

3133
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,510
than one. Right? So basically if I
choose a learning rate that is smaller

3134
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:53,520
choose a learning rate that is smaller
 

3135
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,870
choose a learning rate that is smaller
than 1 / lambda max I know that this

3136
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:56,880
than 1 / lambda max I know that this
 

3137
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,790
than 1 / lambda max I know that this
quantity

3138
01:11:58,790 --> 01:11:58,800
quantity
 

3139
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,189
quantity
is going to be less than one. Is it

3140
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:01,199
is going to be less than one. Is it
 

3141
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,709
is going to be less than one. Is it
sufficient for me to just look at that

3142
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:02,719
sufficient for me to just look at that
 

3143
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:11,350
sufficient for me to just look at that
or do I need to check anything else?

3144
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:11,360

 

3145
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,390

How many people think this is

3146
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:12,400
How many people think this is
 

3147
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,709
How many people think this is
sufficient? How many people think I need

3148
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:14,719
sufficient? How many people think I need
 

3149
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,149
sufficient? How many people think I need
to check anything else?

3150
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:18,159
to check anything else?
 

3151
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,149
to check anything else?
Okay. Well, you're both correct. Both

3152
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:20,159
Okay. Well, you're both correct. Both
 

3153
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,750
Okay. Well, you're both correct. Both
answers are technically valid though

3154
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:21,760
answers are technically valid though
 

3155
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,070
answers are technically valid though
this is in some sense sufficient. So

3156
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,080
this is in some sense sufficient. So
 

3157
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,149
this is in some sense sufficient. So
here we can do the same algebra. We will

3158
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:26,159
here we can do the same algebra. We will
 

3159
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:28,470
here we can do the same algebra. We will
get ADA less than one over lambda min.

3160
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:28,480
get ADA less than one over lambda min.
 

3161
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,830
get ADA less than one over lambda min.
Right? But what do we know about one

3162
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:29,840
Right? But what do we know about one
 

3163
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,350
Right? But what do we know about one
over lambda min and one over lambda max?

3164
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:31,360
over lambda min and one over lambda max?
 

3165
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,550
over lambda min and one over lambda max?
Which one's the bigger one? Which one's

3166
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:32,560
Which one's the bigger one? Which one's
 

3167
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,870
Which one's the bigger one? Which one's
smaller? One over lambda max is always

3168
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:34,880
smaller? One over lambda max is always
 

3169
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,030
smaller? One over lambda max is always
the tighter bound. Right? So if I can

3170
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:37,040
the tighter bound. Right? So if I can
 

3171
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,470
the tighter bound. Right? So if I can
check that ada is less than one over

3172
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:38,480
check that ada is less than one over
 

3173
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,830
check that ada is less than one over
lambda max. This is automatically

3174
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:39,840
lambda max. This is automatically
 

3175
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,390
lambda max. This is automatically
satisfied. So the constraint on my

3176
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:42,400
satisfied. So the constraint on my
 

3177
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,870
satisfied. So the constraint on my
learning rate comes from the largest

3178
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:44,880
learning rate comes from the largest
 

3179
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,630
learning rate comes from the largest
value of this matrix because that's

3180
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:46,640
value of this matrix because that's
 

3181
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,910
value of this matrix because that's
what's trying to blow up your uh your

3182
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:49,920
what's trying to blow up your uh your
 

3183
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,070
what's trying to blow up your uh your
vector or your error as fast as it can.

3184
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,080
vector or your error as fast as it can.
 

3185
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,709
vector or your error as fast as it can.
Right?

3186
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:54,719
Right?
 

3187
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:57,189
Right?
So that's what says this is the maximum

3188
01:12:57,189 --> 01:12:57,199
So that's what says this is the maximum
 

3189
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:00,310
So that's what says this is the maximum
step that you can take. Okay?

3190
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:00,320
step that you can take. Okay?
 

3191
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,870
step that you can take. Okay?
So I don't think I'm

3192
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:02,880
So I don't think I'm
 

3193
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,189
So I don't think I'm
going to

3194
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:05,199
going to
 

3195
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:06,790
going to
do this right now. I'll try to see.

3196
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:06,800
do this right now. I'll try to see.
 

3197
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,870
do this right now. I'll try to see.
Okay. So I'll

3198
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:08,880
Okay. So I'll
 

3199
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,630
Okay. So I'll
do a small bit. Let's see.

3200
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:12,640

 

3201
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,870

So now just to kind of build this

3202
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:14,880
So now just to kind of build this
 

3203
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,750
So now just to kind of build this
intuition further,

3204
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:17,760
intuition further,
 

3205
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,830
intuition further,
this is some constraint on my learning

3206
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:19,840
this is some constraint on my learning
 

3207
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,149
this is some constraint on my learning
rate. Does this tell me which learning

3208
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:22,159
rate. Does this tell me which learning
 

3209
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:23,750
rate. Does this tell me which learning
rate I should choose? You know, I don't

3210
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:23,760
rate I should choose? You know, I don't
 

3211
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,070
rate I should choose? You know, I don't
want just sum any learning rate. But

3212
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,080
want just sum any learning rate. But
 

3213
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,510
want just sum any learning rate. But
what actually matters is actually

3214
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:27,520
what actually matters is actually
 

3215
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,510
what actually matters is actually
choosing a specific learning rate.

3216
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:31,520
choosing a specific learning rate.
 

3217
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,030
choosing a specific learning rate.
Which learning rate might I want to

3218
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:33,040
Which learning rate might I want to
 

3219
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,630
Which learning rate might I want to
choose? Or how do I go about doing that?

3220
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:34,640
choose? Or how do I go about doing that?
 

3221
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,630
choose? Or how do I go about doing that?
Well, one property that I might want to

3222
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:36,640
Well, one property that I might want to
 

3223
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,229
Well, one property that I might want to
have when I am choosing my learning rate

3224
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:40,239
have when I am choosing my learning rate
 

3225
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:44,070
have when I am choosing my learning rate
is I might want to have that all of my

3226
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:44,080
is I might want to have that all of my
 

3227
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,149
is I might want to have that all of my
igen values are as close to each other

3228
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:46,159
igen values are as close to each other
 

3229
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:47,590
igen values are as close to each other
as possible. Basically, my two

3230
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:47,600
as possible. Basically, my two
 

3231
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,149
as possible. Basically, my two
candidates for my maximum. I want to

3232
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:50,159
candidates for my maximum. I want to
 

3233
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,550
candidates for my maximum. I want to
make them as close to each other as

3234
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
make them as close to each other as
 

3235
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,950
make them as close to each other as
possible because then I don't have one

3236
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:54,960
possible because then I don't have one
 

3237
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,470
possible because then I don't have one
direction that's running off and the

3238
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:56,480
direction that's running off and the
 

3239
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,630
direction that's running off and the
other direction that's very slow. Right?

3240
01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:58,640
other direction that's very slow. Right?
 

3241
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,950
other direction that's very slow. Right?
the more uniform I my my learning rate

3242
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:00,960
the more uniform I my my learning rate
 

3243
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,870
the more uniform I my my learning rate
ADA hits every single one of my igen

3244
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:02,880
ADA hits every single one of my igen
 

3245
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,390
ADA hits every single one of my igen
values right so the more evenly

3246
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,400
values right so the more evenly
 

3247
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,870
values right so the more evenly
everything is is decaying the faster I'm

3248
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:08,880
everything is is decaying the faster I'm
 

3249
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,149
everything is is decaying the faster I'm
going to converge otherwise what's going

3250
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:10,159
going to converge otherwise what's going
 

3251
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:11,669
going to converge otherwise what's going
to happen is I'm going to move very fast

3252
01:14:11,669 --> 01:14:11,679
to happen is I'm going to move very fast
 

3253
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,709
to happen is I'm going to move very fast
in some directions and move slowly in

3254
01:14:14,709 --> 01:14:14,719
in some directions and move slowly in
 

3255
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,350
in some directions and move slowly in
other directions so to deal with that

3256
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360
other directions so to deal with that
 

3257
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,030
other directions so to deal with that
basically what I want to have for the

3258
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:19,040
basically what I want to have for the
 

3259
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,430
basically what I want to have for the
fastest convergence is I want to have

3260
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
fastest convergence is I want to have
 

3261
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:27,189
fastest convergence is I want to have
something like this

3262
01:14:27,189 --> 01:14:27,199

 

3263
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:35,030

is I want to have my two candidates

3264
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:35,040

 

3265
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:46,630

be equal.

3266
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:46,640

 

3267
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,470

Okay. And of course you can equalize

3268
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:48,480
Okay. And of course you can equalize
 

3269
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,310
Okay. And of course you can equalize
this if lambda min is equal to lambda

3270
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:50,320
this if lambda min is equal to lambda
 

3271
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,550
this if lambda min is equal to lambda
max. But the other thing that you can do

3272
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:52,560
max. But the other thing that you can do
 

3273
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,590
max. But the other thing that you can do
if you solve this out you will get ADA

3274
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:55,600
if you solve this out you will get ADA
 

3275
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:01,669
if you solve this out you will get ADA
is equal to 1 / lambda min plus

3276
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:01,679
is equal to 1 / lambda min plus
 

3277
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:06,149
is equal to 1 / lambda min plus
lambda max.

3278
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:06,159

 

3279
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,149

Okay.

3280
01:15:08,149 --> 01:15:08,159
Okay.
 

3281
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,470
Okay.
So what you will see is that the optimal

3282
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:10,480
So what you will see is that the optimal
 

3283
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:14,790
So what you will see is that the optimal
ADA that you're going to have

3284
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:14,800

 

3285
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,030

is given by this. And then when you plug

3286
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:17,040
is given by this. And then when you plug
 

3287
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,030
is given by this. And then when you plug
this back in to see what is the actual

3288
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:19,040
this back in to see what is the actual
 

3289
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,110
this back in to see what is the actual
decay rate that you're getting, you'll

3290
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:21,120
decay rate that you're getting, you'll
 

3291
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,550
decay rate that you're getting, you'll
see that the condition number is

3292
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:22,560
see that the condition number is
 

3293
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,149
see that the condition number is
actually going to pop out. So this is

3294
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:24,159
actually going to pop out. So this is
 

3295
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:27,189
actually going to pop out. So this is
going to be the difference between the

3296
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:27,199
going to be the difference between the
 

3297
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:29,830
going to be the difference between the
uh or the ratio of the largest and the

3298
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:29,840
uh or the ratio of the largest and the
 

3299
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,830
uh or the ratio of the largest and the
smallest singular values. And if you

3300
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:31,840
smallest singular values. And if you
 

3301
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,510
smallest singular values. And if you
remember from the discussions on ridge

3302
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:33,520
remember from the discussions on ridge
 

3303
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,149
remember from the discussions on ridge
regression and regularization,

3304
01:15:36,149 --> 01:15:36,159
regression and regularization,
 

3305
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:39,510
regression and regularization,
remember when do things struggle to uh

3306
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:39,520
remember when do things struggle to uh
 

3307
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,189
remember when do things struggle to uh
converge? When do you have these

3308
01:15:41,189 --> 01:15:41,199
converge? When do you have these
 

3309
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:44,229
converge? When do you have these
overfitting problems or uh in your

3310
01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:44,239
overfitting problems or uh in your
 

3311
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,750
overfitting problems or uh in your
training data? Well, it's when your

3312
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:45,760
training data? Well, it's when your
 

3313
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,990
training data? Well, it's when your
condition number is bad, right? And so

3314
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:48,000
condition number is bad, right? And so
 

3315
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,350
condition number is bad, right? And so
you see that all of these things are

3316
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:49,360
you see that all of these things are
 

3317
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,870
you see that all of these things are
kind of connecting up and coming back

3318
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:50,880
kind of connecting up and coming back
 

3319
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,590
kind of connecting up and coming back
together.

3320
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:53,600
together.
 

3321
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,590
together.
So I have five minutes and I'm going to

3322
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,600
So I have five minutes and I'm going to
 

3323
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,830
So I have five minutes and I'm going to
try to get to one more thing in this

3324
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:57,840
try to get to one more thing in this
 

3325
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:05,270
try to get to one more thing in this
time coming back to regularization.

3326
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:05,280

 

3327
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,709

But what I want to try to build up to is

3328
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:08,719
But what I want to try to build up to is
 

3329
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:12,790
But what I want to try to build up to is
the idea of the implicit regularization

3330
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:12,800
the idea of the implicit regularization
 

3331
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,270
the idea of the implicit regularization
of gradient descent. This is coming to

3332
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:15,280
of gradient descent. This is coming to
 

3333
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,110
of gradient descent. This is coming to
the what are the possibilities and

3334
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:17,120
the what are the possibilities and
 

3335
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,470
the what are the possibilities and
limitations that are introduced by

3336
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:18,480
limitations that are introduced by
 

3337
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,630
limitations that are introduced by
gradient descent. Well, one of the very

3338
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:20,640
gradient descent. Well, one of the very
 

3339
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,310
gradient descent. Well, one of the very
cool properties that gradient descent

3340
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:22,320
cool properties that gradient descent
 

3341
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,550
cool properties that gradient descent
has is it has this property of implicit

3342
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:24,560
has is it has this property of implicit
 

3343
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,550
has is it has this property of implicit
regularization. Have people heard this

3344
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:26,560
regularization. Have people heard this
 

3345
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,510
regularization. Have people heard this
term implicit regularization before? No.

3346
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:29,520
term implicit regularization before? No.
 

3347
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,630
term implicit regularization before? No.
There's no expectation that you have. Um

3348
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:32,640
There's no expectation that you have. Um
 

3349
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,350
There's no expectation that you have. Um
but this is something that people uh or

3350
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:35,360
but this is something that people uh or
 

3351
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,270
but this is something that people uh or
that you know is a is a nice thing about

3352
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:37,280
that you know is a is a nice thing about
 

3353
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,830
that you know is a is a nice thing about
gradient descent. And the way that we

3354
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:39,840
gradient descent. And the way that we
 

3355
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,550
gradient descent. And the way that we
can understand this property is through

3356
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,560
can understand this property is through
 

3357
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,709
can understand this property is through
uh thinking about specifically uh

3358
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:46,719
uh thinking about specifically uh
 

3359
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,550
uh thinking about specifically uh
gradient descent from the perspective of

3360
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:48,560
gradient descent from the perspective of
 

3361
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,870
gradient descent from the perspective of
igen values and singular values. Okay.

3362
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:50,880
igen values and singular values. Okay.
 

3363
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,149
igen values and singular values. Okay.
So I'm not going to be able to finish

3364
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:52,159
So I'm not going to be able to finish
 

3365
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:54,070
So I'm not going to be able to finish
all of it today given the time I have

3366
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:54,080
all of it today given the time I have
 

3367
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,430
all of it today given the time I have
but I'm going to start building up to

3368
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:55,440
but I'm going to start building up to
 

3369
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,669
but I'm going to start building up to
it. And what I would like you to do is I

3370
01:16:57,669 --> 01:16:57,679
it. And what I would like you to do is I
 

3371
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,470
it. And what I would like you to do is I
would like you to go home remember ridge

3372
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
would like you to go home remember ridge
 

3373
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,270
would like you to go home remember ridge
remember SVD so that we can finish this

3374
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:03,280
remember SVD so that we can finish this
 

3375
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,030
remember SVD so that we can finish this
next time and you'll be fully on board.

3376
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
next time and you'll be fully on board.
 

3377
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,790
next time and you'll be fully on board.
Plus you have to do homework zero which

3378
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:06,800
Plus you have to do homework zero which
 

3379
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,590
Plus you have to do homework zero which
you have to learn that for. But now let

3380
01:17:09,590 --> 01:17:09,600
you have to learn that for. But now let
 

3381
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,709
you have to learn that for. But now let
me take for example the ridge solution.

3382
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:14,719

 

3383
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,950

And my ridge solution looks something

3384
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:16,960
And my ridge solution looks something
 

3385
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,030
And my ridge solution looks something
like this. Right? So if now my loss was

3386
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:19,040
like this. Right? So if now my loss was
 

3387
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,070
like this. Right? So if now my loss was
the following

3388
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:22,080
the following
 

3389
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:31,510
the following
xw - y.

3390
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:31,520

 

3391
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,510

And now you should have um this

3392
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:35,520
And now you should have um this
 

3393
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:48,470
And now you should have um this
expression should look familiar,

3394
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:48,480

 

3395
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,990

right? Everyone's seen this expression

3396
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:50,000
right? Everyone's seen this expression
 

3397
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,790
right? Everyone's seen this expression
before.

3398
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800
before.
 

3399
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,110
before.
This is also by the way equal to the

3400
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:55,120
This is also by the way equal to the
 

3401
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,870
This is also by the way equal to the
following. So this is like kind of like

3402
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:56,880
following. So this is like kind of like
 

3403
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,550
following. So this is like kind of like
the least squares version of ridge.

3404
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:58,560
the least squares version of ridge.
 

3405
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,390
the least squares version of ridge.
There's also the minor version of ridge

3406
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:00,400
There's also the minor version of ridge
 

3407
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,030
There's also the minor version of ridge
or the kernel ridge form

3408
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:03,040
or the kernel ridge form
 

3409
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,510
or the kernel ridge form
um xxrpose

3410
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:05,520
um xxrpose
 

3411
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,709
um xxrpose
plus lambda i

3412
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:08,719
plus lambda i
 

3413
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,310
plus lambda i
inverse

3414
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,320
inverse
 

3415
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,229
inverse
time y.

3416
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:12,239
time y.
 

3417
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:21,590
time y.
So this

3418
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:21,600

 

3419
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,189

the kernel

3420
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:27,199

 

3421
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:30,470

um This has some nice properties that um

3422
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:30,480
um This has some nice properties that um
 

3423
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,149
um This has some nice properties that um
I don't think I have the time to talk

3424
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:32,159
I don't think I have the time to talk
 

3425
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,149
I don't think I have the time to talk
about but definitely remind yourself of

3426
01:18:34,149 --> 01:18:34,159
about but definitely remind yourself of
 

3427
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:36,709
about but definitely remind yourself of
why it is nicer to think about in a

3428
01:18:36,709 --> 01:18:36,719
why it is nicer to think about in a
 

3429
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:40,149
why it is nicer to think about in a
sense xxxrpose compared to xrpose x

3430
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:40,159
sense xxxrpose compared to xrpose x
 

3431
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:42,149
sense xxxrpose compared to xrpose x
because xxrpose is just computing the

3432
01:18:42,149 --> 01:18:42,159
because xxrpose is just computing the
 

3433
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:43,910
because xxrpose is just computing the
inner products of your features or inner

3434
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:43,920
inner products of your features or inner
 

3435
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,030
inner products of your features or inner
products of your data right and so for

3436
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:47,040
products of your data right and so for
 

3437
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,470
products of your data right and so for
functions where you can easily compute

3438
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:48,480
functions where you can easily compute
 

3439
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:51,030
functions where you can easily compute
the inner products this kernel form can

3440
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040
the inner products this kernel form can
 

3441
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:56,709
the inner products this kernel form can
be a lot easier and faster to compute.

3442
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719

 

3443
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,510

But now if I think about this X is equal

3444
01:18:59,510 --> 01:18:59,520
But now if I think about this X is equal
 

3445
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,229
But now if I think about this X is equal
to U sigma VRpose as my SVD of X.

3446
01:19:04,229 --> 01:19:04,239
to U sigma VRpose as my SVD of X.
 

3447
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:08,630
to U sigma VRpose as my SVD of X.
How can I write W star?

3448
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:08,640
How can I write W star?
 

3449
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,830
How can I write W star?
Well, I can write star

3450
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:11,840
Well, I can write star
 

3451
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,590
Well, I can write star
and I will just write this out

3452
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:15,600
and I will just write this out
 

3453
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,310
and I will just write this out
as

3454
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:18,320
as
 

3455
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:27,830
as
I'll use this form.

3456
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:27,840

 

3457
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,910

I'm going to have this xrpose x. So I'll

3458
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:29,920
I'm going to have this xrpose x. So I'll
 

3459
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,870
I'm going to have this xrpose x. So I'll
I'll I'll I'll

3460
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:32,880
I'll I'll I'll
 

3461
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,189
I'll I'll I'll
um

3462
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:37,199

 

3463
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:45,750

yeah.

3464
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:45,760

 

3465
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:53,750

Um

3466
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:53,760

 

3467
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:59,430

so let me plug in uh I get v sigma

This is my w star.

3480
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:30,880

 

3481
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,830

And I will I'm just out of time. Okay, I

3482
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:33,840
And I will I'm just out of time. Okay, I
 

3483
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,950
And I will I'm just out of time. Okay, I
will do this again next time. But this

3484
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:36,960
will do this again next time. But this
 

3485
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,350
will do this again next time. But this
basically what I want to point out is

3486
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:39,360
basically what I want to point out is
 

3487
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,830
basically what I want to point out is
that this I can write

3488
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:43,840

 

3489
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:57,750

as the following.

3490
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:57,760

 

3491
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,870

Okay.

3492
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:00,880

 

3493
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,990

Yeah.

3494
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,000

 

3495
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,310

Okay. So what I want to say here uh I'll

3496
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:08,320
Okay. So what I want to say here uh I'll
 

3497
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,790
Okay. So what I want to say here uh I'll
do this again next time but what I want

3498
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:10,800
do this again next time but what I want
 

3499
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,870
do this again next time but what I want
to say here

3500
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:12,880
to say here
 

3501
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,830
to say here
is look at this particular quantity here

3502
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:15,840
is look at this particular quantity here
 

3503
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,550
is look at this particular quantity here
right so these are the singular vectors

3504
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:18,560
right so these are the singular vectors
 

3505
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,470
right so these are the singular vectors
here and here the left and the right

3506
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:20,480
here and here the left and the right
 

3507
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,350
here and here the left and the right
singular vectors

3508
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:23,360
singular vectors
 

3509
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,950
singular vectors
if I can basically what this is saying

3510
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:24,960
if I can basically what this is saying
 

3511
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,390
if I can basically what this is saying
is like look I'm like if I look at

3512
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:26,400
is like look I'm like if I look at
 

3513
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,830
is like look I'm like if I look at
gradient descent it's going it's

3514
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:27,840
gradient descent it's going it's
 

3515
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:30,149
gradient descent it's going it's
decoupling the movement in the

3516
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:30,159
decoupling the movement in the
 

3517
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,070
decoupling the movement in the
directions given by each of the singular

3518
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:32,080
directions given by each of the singular
 

3519
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,350
directions given by each of the singular
vectors right that's what these are

3520
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:33,360
vectors right that's what these are
 

3521
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,070
vectors right that's what these are
these things are pulling out

3522
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,080
these things are pulling out
 

3523
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,030
these things are pulling out
and what this quantity is here when

3524
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:39,040
and what this quantity is here when
 

3525
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,030
and what this quantity is here when
lambda is very very close to zero when

3526
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:41,040
lambda is very very close to zero when
 

3527
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:45,910
lambda is very very close to zero when
it's very small what I have is that

3528
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:45,920
it's very small what I have is that
 

3529
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,390
it's very small what I have is that
this thing becomes very small right if

3530
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:48,400
this thing becomes very small right if
 

3531
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,990
this thing becomes very small right if
if lambda is very close to zero sigma

3532
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:52,000
if lambda is very close to zero sigma
 

3533
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,390
if lambda is very close to zero sigma
square over sigma squar is basically one

3534
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:54,400
square over sigma squar is basically one
 

3535
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:57,990
square over sigma squar is basically one
over sigma

3536
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:58,000

 

3537
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,910

>> sorry

3538
01:21:59,910 --> 01:21:59,920
>> sorry
 

3539
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,990
>> sorry
Yeah,

3540
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:04,000

 

3541
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,709

this sigma over sigma squar uh is

3542
01:22:06,709 --> 01:22:06,719
this sigma over sigma squar uh is
 

3543
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,870
this sigma over sigma squar uh is
basically like one over sigma. Whereas

3544
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:08,880
basically like one over sigma. Whereas
 

3545
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,430
basically like one over sigma. Whereas
when lambda is very large, what we get

3546
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:11,440
when lambda is very large, what we get
 

3547
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,470
when lambda is very large, what we get
is that this thing uh is close to zero

3548
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:14,480
is that this thing uh is close to zero
 

3549
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,990
is that this thing uh is close to zero
and then you don't see any movement in

3550
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
and then you don't see any movement in
 

3551
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,070
and then you don't see any movement in
any of those directions.

3552
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:18,080
any of those directions.
 

3553
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,750
any of those directions.
So we will talk about how this is

3554
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:19,760
So we will talk about how this is
 

3555
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,430
So we will talk about how this is
connected to early stopping of gradient

3556
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:21,440
connected to early stopping of gradient
 

3557
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,910
connected to early stopping of gradient
descent in the in the next lecture. I'm

3558
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:23,920
descent in the in the next lecture. I'm
 

3559
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,950
descent in the in the next lecture. I'm
over time so I'll stop here now.

3560
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:26,960
over time so I'll stop here now.
 

3561
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:27,350
over time so I'll stop here now.
>> So we have

3562
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:27,360
>> So we have
 

3563
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,030
>> So we have
>> office hours in 400 Cy.

3564
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:29,040
>> office hours in 400 Cy.
 

3565
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:33,239
>> office hours in 400 Cy.
>> Yeah. So, we'll walk over there next.
