1
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,990

We're at Berkeley time so I can start.

2
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,000
We're at Berkeley time so I can start.
 

3
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,270
We're at Berkeley time so I can start.
So before I start uh just enrollment

4
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
So before I start uh just enrollment
 

5
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,149
So before I start uh just enrollment
issues should be settled. um if they are

6
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
issues should be settled. um if they are
 

7
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,710
issues should be settled. um if they are
not settled come see us in office hours

8
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
not settled come see us in office hours
 

9
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,949
not settled come see us in office hours
and we put up a post about uh

10
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
and we put up a post about uh
 

11
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,589
and we put up a post about uh
participation credit and what are the

12
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
participation credit and what are the
 

13
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,830
participation credit and what are the
different things you can and need to do.

14
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
different things you can and need to do.
 

15
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,429
different things you can and need to do.
So, I'm not really going to take

16
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
So, I'm not really going to take
 

17
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,030
So, I'm not really going to take
actually any questions about that in

18
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
actually any questions about that in
 

19
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,670
actually any questions about that in
lecture here, but go read the post, ask

20
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
lecture here, but go read the post, ask
 

21
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,190
lecture here, but go read the post, ask
questions um on ed.

22
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
questions um on ed.
 

23
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,349
questions um on ed.
Any other pressing concerns before I

24
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
Any other pressing concerns before I
 

25
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,909
Any other pressing concerns before I
start the lecture?

26
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
start the lecture?
 

27
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,430
start the lecture?
Okay, great. So, today's lecture, we're

28
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
Okay, great. So, today's lecture, we're
 

29
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,030
Okay, great. So, today's lecture, we're
building from what we've been doing in

30
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
building from what we've been doing in
 

31
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,590
building from what we've been doing in
the last class. And today's lecture

32
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
the last class. And today's lecture
 

33
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,510
the last class. And today's lecture
really what I would like you to take

34
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
really what I would like you to take
 

35
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,790
really what I would like you to take
home from this lecture is perspective.

36
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
home from this lecture is perspective.
 

37
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,870
home from this lecture is perspective.
uh more so than a particular technique

38
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
uh more so than a particular technique
 

39
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,990
uh more so than a particular technique
or a particular mathematical trick. I

40
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
or a particular mathematical trick. I
 

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,150
or a particular mathematical trick. I
think the the key agenda here is is

42
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
think the the key agenda here is is
 

43
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,710
think the the key agenda here is is
putting forth the value of perspective

44
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
putting forth the value of perspective
 

45
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,230
putting forth the value of perspective
and

46
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
and
 

47
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,110
and
what we can what we can do with it. So

48
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
what we can what we can do with it. So
 

49
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,510
what we can what we can do with it. So
we've been talking a lot about

50
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
we've been talking a lot about
 

51
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,230
we've been talking a lot about
optimizers and initialization. That's

52
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
optimizers and initialization. That's
 

53
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,510
optimizers and initialization. That's
been kind of what we've uh what we've

54
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
been kind of what we've uh what we've
 

55
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,350
been kind of what we've uh what we've
been doing and we're focusing in some

56
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
been doing and we're focusing in some
 

57
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,230
been doing and we're focusing in some
sense a lot on details,

58
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
sense a lot on details,
 

59
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,710
sense a lot on details,
right? And it turns out that these

60
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
right? And it turns out that these
 

61
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,749
right? And it turns out that these
details actually really really matter.

62
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
details actually really really matter.
 

63
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,670
details actually really really matter.
You know it might feel like oh you know

64
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
You know it might feel like oh you know
 

65
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,110
You know it might feel like oh you know
who cares how we initialize like it's

66
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
who cares how we initialize like it's
 

67
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,189
who cares how we initialize like it's
some random initialization.

68
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
some random initialization.
 

69
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,029
some random initialization.
Gradient descent will fix it. Well turns

70
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
Gradient descent will fix it. Well turns
 

71
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,550
Gradient descent will fix it. Well turns
out that these things actually really

72
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:14,560
out that these things actually really
 

73
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,710
out that these things actually really
matter. And why do we care about all of

74
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
matter. And why do we care about all of
 

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,070
matter. And why do we care about all of
these things? Why do we care about which

76
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
these things? Why do we care about which
 

77
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,909
these things? Why do we care about which
optimizer we choose? We care about all

78
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
optimizer we choose? We care about all
 

79
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,270
optimizer we choose? We care about all
of these things because in some sense

80
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
of these things because in some sense
 

81
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,230
of these things because in some sense
better optimizer means faster training

82
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
better optimizer means faster training
 

83
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,629
better optimizer means faster training
means you spend less money, right? Which

84
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
means you spend less money, right? Which
 

85
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,510
means you spend less money, right? Which
means you make more money. Um so it's

86
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
means you make more money. Um so it's
 

87
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,150
means you make more money. Um so it's
just very simple capitalism in some

88
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
just very simple capitalism in some
 

89
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,350
just very simple capitalism in some
sense that drives us to have better and

90
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
sense that drives us to have better and
 

91
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,550
sense that drives us to have better and
better um optimizers. Similarly about

92
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
better um optimizers. Similarly about
 

93
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,870
better um optimizers. Similarly about
initialization you know why was it

94
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
initialization you know why was it
 

95
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,510
initialization you know why was it
really great that

96
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
really great that
 

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,350
really great that
Xavier initialization came about and

98
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
Xavier initialization came about and
 

99
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,070
Xavier initialization came about and
then her initialization came about. You

100
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
then her initialization came about. You
 

101
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,510
then her initialization came about. You
know when we presented it's like well

102
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
know when we presented it's like well
 

103
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,590
know when we presented it's like well
you know if you have D things coming in

104
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
you know if you have D things coming in
 

105
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,990
you know if you have D things coming in
and you want things to be on average the

106
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
and you want things to be on average the
 

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,150
and you want things to be on average the
same well you know divide by D. is kind

108
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
same well you know divide by D. is kind
 

109
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,070
same well you know divide by D. is kind
of like what's the big deal, right? Why

110
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
of like what's the big deal, right? Why
 

111
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,430
of like what's the big deal, right? Why
did we spend half a lecture talking

112
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
did we spend half a lecture talking
 

113
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,430
did we spend half a lecture talking
about this? Well, just to put things

114
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
about this? Well, just to put things
 

115
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,070
about this? Well, just to put things
into perspective before this, how would

116
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
into perspective before this, how would
 

117
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,790
into perspective before this, how would
we do initialization? We would just say

118
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
we do initialization? We would just say
 

119
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,110
we do initialization? We would just say
let's put normal 01 ones every

120
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
let's put normal 01 ones every
 

121
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,110
let's put normal 01 ones every
everywhere. Let's initialize that way.

122
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
everywhere. Let's initialize that way.
 

123
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,950
everywhere. Let's initialize that way.
And then what would happen? Well, you

124
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
And then what would happen? Well, you
 

125
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,550
And then what would happen? Well, you
know, your stuff wouldn't train. It

126
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
know, your stuff wouldn't train. It
 

127
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,390
know, your stuff wouldn't train. It
wouldn't work. You wouldn't you would

128
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400
wouldn't work. You wouldn't you would
 

129
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,350
wouldn't work. You wouldn't you would
there wasn't like wrong initialization

130
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
there wasn't like wrong initialization
 

131
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,749
there wasn't like wrong initialization
error would not pop up. What would

132
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
error would not pop up. What would
 

133
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,270
error would not pop up. What would
happen is that well you're, you know,

134
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
happen is that well you're, you know,
 

135
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,710
happen is that well you're, you know,
either your maybe your gradients would

136
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
either your maybe your gradients would
 

137
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,150
either your maybe your gradients would
vanish, maybe they would blow up, maybe

138
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
vanish, maybe they would blow up, maybe
 

139
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,629
vanish, maybe they would blow up, maybe
you wouldn't even notice it, but stuff

140
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
you wouldn't even notice it, but stuff
 

141
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,749
you wouldn't even notice it, but stuff
would just not work and then you're

142
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
would just not work and then you're
 

143
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,710
would just not work and then you're
tweaking and you're tweaking and you're

144
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
tweaking and you're tweaking and you're
 

145
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,550
tweaking and you're tweaking and you're
tweaking and you're tweaking and if you

146
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
tweaking and you're tweaking and if you
 

147
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,390
tweaking and you're tweaking and if you
think about it, figuring out the right

148
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
think about it, figuring out the right
 

149
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,430
think about it, figuring out the right
initialization is like the worst

150
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
initialization is like the worst
 

151
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,029
initialization is like the worst
hyperparameter search you could have,

152
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
hyperparameter search you could have,
 

153
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,150
hyperparameter search you could have,
right? Think about the number of

154
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
right? Think about the number of
 

155
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,070
right? Think about the number of
parameters you have. If you think about

156
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
parameters you have. If you think about
 

157
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,270
parameters you have. If you think about
every initialization as a

158
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
every initialization as a
 

159
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,670
every initialization as a
hyperparameter, that's a lot to search

160
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
hyperparameter, that's a lot to search
 

161
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,230
hyperparameter, that's a lot to search
over. Okay. So, um just having these

162
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
over. Okay. So, um just having these
 

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,390
over. Okay. So, um just having these
rules of thumb and having things like

164
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
rules of thumb and having things like
 

165
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,670
rules of thumb and having things like
the Xavier initialization, H

166
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
the Xavier initialization, H
 

167
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,870
the Xavier initialization, H
initialization were uh were a big deal.

168
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
initialization were uh were a big deal.
 

169
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,110
initialization were uh were a big deal.
And now, you know, these are just all

170
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
And now, you know, these are just all
 

171
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,469
And now, you know, these are just all
built in. There's libraries. You don't

172
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
built in. There's libraries. You don't
 

173
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,870
built in. There's libraries. You don't
even need to think about it, but it

174
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
even need to think about it, but it
 

175
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,790
even need to think about it, but it
mattered and thinking about these things

176
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
mattered and thinking about these things
 

177
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,029
mattered and thinking about these things
in a principled mathematical way

178
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
in a principled mathematical way
 

179
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,629
in a principled mathematical way
actually led to progress. Okay? So, just

180
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
actually led to progress. Okay? So, just
 

181
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,390
actually led to progress. Okay? So, just
we didn't really talk about that as much

182
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
we didn't really talk about that as much
 

183
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,830
we didn't really talk about that as much
last time and make it explicit. So, I

184
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
last time and make it explicit. So, I
 

185
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,029
last time and make it explicit. So, I
want to make sure that that's clear to

186
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
want to make sure that that's clear to
 

187
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,430
want to make sure that that's clear to
everybody. Okay.

188
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
everybody. Okay.
 

189
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,270
everybody. Okay.
And so nowadays when we think about

190
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
And so nowadays when we think about
 

191
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,790
And so nowadays when we think about
optimizers

192
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
optimizers
 

193
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,589
optimizers
um you know Adam W.

194
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599

 

195
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:36,290

>> Okay.

196
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:36,300

 

197
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:43,510

[Laughter]

198
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520

 

199
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,430

>> So okay let's turn this off.

200
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
>> So okay let's turn this off.
 

201
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,909
>> So okay let's turn this off.
Okay.

202
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
Okay.
 

203
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,550
Okay.
Um

204
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
Um
 

205
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,909
Um
so nowadays when we're thinking about

206
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
so nowadays when we're thinking about
 

207
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,070
so nowadays when we're thinking about
optimization what we think about and the

208
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
optimization what we think about and the
 

209
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,350
optimization what we think about and the
kind of default thing is to use atom w

210
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
kind of default thing is to use atom w
 

211
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,629
kind of default thing is to use atom w
in some sense with um a specific set of

212
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
in some sense with um a specific set of
 

213
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,710
in some sense with um a specific set of
hyperparameters. You know atom used to

214
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
hyperparameters. You know atom used to
 

215
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,790
hyperparameters. You know atom used to
be great and then people noticed that

216
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
be great and then people noticed that
 

217
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,110
be great and then people noticed that
the kind of having regularization

218
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
the kind of having regularization
 

219
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,430
the kind of having regularization
through the standard L2 loss was causing

220
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
through the standard L2 loss was causing
 

221
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,790
through the standard L2 loss was causing
complications like it was interacting

222
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
complications like it was interacting
 

223
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,029
complications like it was interacting
with the learning rate. So AdamW came

224
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
with the learning rate. So AdamW came
 

225
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,029
with the learning rate. So AdamW came
about which said, "Oh, you know this

226
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
about which said, "Oh, you know this
 

227
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,029
about which said, "Oh, you know this
weight decay, just pull it out and put

228
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
weight decay, just pull it out and put
 

229
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,950
weight decay, just pull it out and put
an explicit wake DK not through

230
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
an explicit wake DK not through
 

231
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,469
an explicit wake DK not through
regularization

232
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
regularization
 

233
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,150
regularization
into your optimizer and that will

234
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
into your optimizer and that will
 

235
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,510
into your optimizer and that will
perform better." And so because there's

236
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
perform better." And so because there's
 

237
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,029
perform better." And so because there's
such a focus on getting optimization to

238
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
such a focus on getting optimization to
 

239
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,350
such a focus on getting optimization to
work well for neural networks, there's

240
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
work well for neural networks, there's
 

241
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,430
work well for neural networks, there's
been tons and tons of work on optimizing

242
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,440
been tons and tons of work on optimizing
 

243
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,750
been tons and tons of work on optimizing
atom W, right? and getting the exact

244
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
atom W, right? and getting the exact
 

245
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,070
atom W, right? and getting the exact
right hyperparameters, getting the exact

246
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
right hyperparameters, getting the exact
 

247
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,790
right hyperparameters, getting the exact
stuff to scale for the standard kinds of

248
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
stuff to scale for the standard kinds of
 

249
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,030
stuff to scale for the standard kinds of
architectures that we have out there.

250
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
architectures that we have out there.
 

251
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,470
architectures that we have out there.
And it's important to remember that

252
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
And it's important to remember that
 

253
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,310
And it's important to remember that
getting something to work on a small

254
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
getting something to work on a small
 

255
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,030
getting something to work on a small
model is different from getting

256
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
model is different from getting
 

257
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,430
model is different from getting
something to work on a billion parameter

258
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
something to work on a billion parameter
 

259
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,990
something to work on a billion parameter
or a trillion parameter model, right? So

260
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
or a trillion parameter model, right? So
 

261
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,430
or a trillion parameter model, right? So
there's, you know, something might work

262
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
there's, you know, something might work
 

263
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,269
there's, you know, something might work
in in a little class project, but that

264
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
in in a little class project, but that
 

265
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,310
in in a little class project, but that
doesn't necessarily mean it's going to

266
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
doesn't necessarily mean it's going to
 

267
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,630
doesn't necessarily mean it's going to
work at scale. And so there's all of

268
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
work at scale. And so there's all of
 

269
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,590
work at scale. And so there's all of
these challenges with being able to

270
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
these challenges with being able to
 

271
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,550
these challenges with being able to
scale our optimization strategies to

272
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
scale our optimization strategies to
 

273
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,030
scale our optimization strategies to
larger and larger networks.

274
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
larger and larger networks.
 

275
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,949
larger and larger networks.
Now, one of the challenges that you have

276
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
Now, one of the challenges that you have
 

277
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,630
Now, one of the challenges that you have
when you think about Adam is that

278
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
when you think about Adam is that
 

279
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,949
when you think about Adam is that
because there's been such an effort to

280
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
because there's been such an effort to
 

281
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,070
because there's been such an effort to
get neural networks to train and get

282
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
get neural networks to train and get
 

283
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,310
get neural networks to train and get
things to work at scale,

284
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
things to work at scale,
 

285
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,030
things to work at scale,
we as a community have focused a lot on

286
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
we as a community have focused a lot on
 

287
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,910
we as a community have focused a lot on
getting Adam or Adam W right. And so

288
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
getting Adam or Adam W right. And so
 

289
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,829
getting Adam or Adam W right. And so
there's been been a huge effort in

290
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
there's been been a huge effort in
 

291
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,829
there's been been a huge effort in
figuring out these parameters. But what

292
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
figuring out these parameters. But what
 

293
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,949
figuring out these parameters. But what
this means is that sometimes

294
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
this means is that sometimes
 

295
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,630
this means is that sometimes
coming up with a different optimizer and

296
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
coming up with a different optimizer and
 

297
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,430
coming up with a different optimizer and
making progress when you have a

298
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
making progress when you have a
 

299
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,110
making progress when you have a
finetuned machine that works for this

300
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
finetuned machine that works for this
 

301
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,990
finetuned machine that works for this
particular optimizer can be difficult.

302
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
particular optimizer can be difficult.
 

303
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,389
particular optimizer can be difficult.
Okay? Because you don't necessarily have

304
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
Okay? Because you don't necessarily have
 

305
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,150
Okay? Because you don't necessarily have
the all of that hyperparameter tuning.

306
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
the all of that hyperparameter tuning.
 

307
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,949
the all of that hyperparameter tuning.
You haven't figured out all the

308
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
You haven't figured out all the
 

309
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,630
You haven't figured out all the
hyperparameters for your new optimizer.

310
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
hyperparameters for your new optimizer.
 

311
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,230
hyperparameters for your new optimizer.
So how do you really compare? because

312
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
So how do you really compare? because
 

313
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,750
So how do you really compare? because
you have all this investment in looking

314
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
you have all this investment in looking
 

315
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,670
you have all this investment in looking
at Adam.

316
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
at Adam.
 

317
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,829
at Adam.
So there's there's there's in some sense

318
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
So there's there's there's in some sense
 

319
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,550
So there's there's there's in some sense
that that's that's a challenge and so

320
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:08,560
that that's that's a challenge and so
 

321
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,389
that that's that's a challenge and so
what we need to think about or what we

322
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
what we need to think about or what we
 

323
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,150
what we need to think about or what we
are trying to do is well how do we

324
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
are trying to do is well how do we
 

325
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,150
are trying to do is well how do we
continue making progress on

326
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
continue making progress on
 

327
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,829
continue making progress on
optimization?

328
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
optimization?
 

329
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,550
optimization?
Okay. And why do we want to continue

330
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
Okay. And why do we want to continue
 

331
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,230
Okay. And why do we want to continue
making progress on optimization? Well,

332
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
making progress on optimization? Well,
 

333
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,150
making progress on optimization? Well,
this comes to something we were talking

334
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
this comes to something we were talking
 

335
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,230
this comes to something we were talking
about not last lecture but two lectures

336
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
about not last lecture but two lectures
 

337
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,150
about not last lecture but two lectures
ago where we talked about this uh lazy

338
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
ago where we talked about this uh lazy
 

339
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,470
ago where we talked about this uh lazy
training idea, right? Everyone remember

340
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
training idea, right? Everyone remember
 

341
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,110
training idea, right? Everyone remember
what lazy training was?

342
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
what lazy training was?
 

343
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,670
what lazy training was?
So the lazy training idea was this was

344
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
So the lazy training idea was this was
 

345
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,870
So the lazy training idea was this was
this observation that people had um that

346
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
this observation that people had um that
 

347
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,590
this observation that people had um that
hey sometimes I initialize a network and

348
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
hey sometimes I initialize a network and
 

349
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,829
hey sometimes I initialize a network and
I train it and you know my my uh

350
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
I train it and you know my my uh
 

351
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,030
I train it and you know my my uh
training loss is going down my

352
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
training loss is going down my
 

353
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,590
training loss is going down my
validation loss is going down but my

354
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
validation loss is going down but my
 

355
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,030
validation loss is going down but my
parameters aren't really changing at

356
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
parameters aren't really changing at
 

357
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,670
parameters aren't really changing at
all. Maybe my final layer is changing

358
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
all. Maybe my final layer is changing
 

359
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,430
all. Maybe my final layer is changing
but most of my other weights are just

360
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
but most of my other weights are just
 

361
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,269
but most of my other weights are just
frozen where they are or like changing

362
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
frozen where they are or like changing
 

363
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,430
frozen where they are or like changing
by very very small amounts. Okay.

364
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
by very very small amounts. Okay.
 

365
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,949
by very very small amounts. Okay.
And when you think about this, there's

366
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
And when you think about this, there's
 

367
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,030
And when you think about this, there's
two different ways in which you can view

368
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
two different ways in which you can view
 

369
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,910
two different ways in which you can view
this uh lazy training assumption. Okay,

370
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
this uh lazy training assumption. Okay,
 

371
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,990
this uh lazy training assumption. Okay,
so what are the two different ways? One

372
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
so what are the two different ways? One
 

373
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,990
so what are the two different ways? One
is oh my gosh, this is magic. You know,

374
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
is oh my gosh, this is magic. You know,
 

375
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,630
is oh my gosh, this is magic. You know,
I chose some random weights and turns

376
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
I chose some random weights and turns
 

377
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,949
I chose some random weights and turns
out that basically these are some random

378
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
out that basically these are some random
 

379
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,030
out that basically these are some random
feature computations and as as long as I

380
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,040
feature computations and as as long as I
 

381
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,949
feature computations and as as long as I
do some random feature computations and

382
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
do some random feature computations and
 

383
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,269
do some random feature computations and
tune maybe my last layer, I'm able to do

384
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
tune maybe my last layer, I'm able to do
 

385
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,389
tune maybe my last layer, I'm able to do
reasonably well. Okay. And so I am uh

386
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
reasonably well. Okay. And so I am uh
 

387
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,350
reasonably well. Okay. And so I am uh
able to like so the the question is well

388
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
able to like so the the question is well
 

389
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,470
able to like so the the question is well
what kinds of functions can I represent

390
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
what kinds of functions can I represent
 

391
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,550
what kinds of functions can I represent
given that I am doing these random

392
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
given that I am doing these random
 

393
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,110
given that I am doing these random
feature computations is everyone with me

394
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
feature computations is everyone with me
 

395
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,829
feature computations is everyone with me
on this or yes no kind of no okay I've

396
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
on this or yes no kind of no okay I've
 

397
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,269
on this or yes no kind of no okay I've
lost some people okay so ask me a

398
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
lost some people okay so ask me a
 

399
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:58,710
lost some people okay so ask me a
question

400
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720

 

401
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,949

okay let's step Okay,

402
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959

 

403
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,470

we care about money. Everyone's with me

404
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
we care about money. Everyone's with me
 

405
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,030
we care about money. Everyone's with me
there. Okay, we Okay, we have a baseline

406
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
there. Okay, we Okay, we have a baseline
 

407
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,910
there. Okay, we Okay, we have a baseline
we agree on. Okay, then the next thing,

408
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
we agree on. Okay, then the next thing,
 

409
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,710
we agree on. Okay, then the next thing,
what do we want to talk about? We want

410
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
what do we want to talk about? We want
 

411
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,190
what do we want to talk about? We want
to be able to do do we are you with me

412
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200
to be able to do do we are you with me
 

413
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,230
to be able to do do we are you with me
that we want better optimizers? Okay.

414
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
that we want better optimizers? Okay.
 

415
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,030
that we want better optimizers? Okay.
Okay. Are you with me that Adam is what

416
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
Okay. Are you with me that Adam is what
 

417
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,269
Okay. Are you with me that Adam is what
people do?

418
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279

 

419
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,750

So now the question is how do we get

420
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
So now the question is how do we get
 

421
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,230
So now the question is how do we get
better? Okay, let's say our question is

422
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
better? Okay, let's say our question is
 

423
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,670
better? Okay, let's say our question is
just how do we get better?

424
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680

 

425
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,910

The question is why do we need to get

426
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920
The question is why do we need to get
 

427
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,829
The question is why do we need to get
better? Right? Why is Adam not good

428
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
better? Right? Why is Adam not good
 

429
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,110
better? Right? Why is Adam not good
enough? Okay, why are we not saturated

430
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
enough? Okay, why are we not saturated
 

431
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,150
enough? Okay, why are we not saturated
at Adam? Why is Adam not good enough? Or

432
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
at Adam? Why is Adam not good enough? Or
 

433
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,389
at Adam? Why is Adam not good enough? Or
why do we have a thought that maybe Adam

434
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
why do we have a thought that maybe Adam
 

435
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,870
why do we have a thought that maybe Adam
could be better? One reason is for

436
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
could be better? One reason is for
 

437
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,870
could be better? One reason is for
example that you notice this lazy

438
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880
example that you notice this lazy
 

439
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,710
example that you notice this lazy
training perspective that sometimes

440
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
training perspective that sometimes
 

441
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,150
training perspective that sometimes
the weights don't move when you're

442
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
the weights don't move when you're
 

443
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,430
the weights don't move when you're
optimizing with an optimizer like Adam.

444
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
optimizing with an optimizer like Adam.
 

445
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,670
optimizing with an optimizer like Adam.
Okay. And now if the weights are not

446
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
Okay. And now if the weights are not
 

447
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,430
Okay. And now if the weights are not
moving you can have two perspectives.

448
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
moving you can have two perspectives.
 

449
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,069
moving you can have two perspectives.
Either well great somehow I'm really

450
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
Either well great somehow I'm really
 

451
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,829
Either well great somehow I'm really
good at choosing initializations or

452
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
good at choosing initializations or
 

453
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,310
good at choosing initializations or
maybe my initial initialization doesn't

454
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,320
maybe my initial initialization doesn't
 

455
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,389
maybe my initial initialization doesn't
matter at all and all that matters is

456
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
matter at all and all that matters is
 

457
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,389
matter at all and all that matters is
that I have some nonlinear features that

458
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
that I have some nonlinear features that
 

459
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,069
that I have some nonlinear features that
I'm computing from my data. That's

460
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
I'm computing from my data. That's
 

461
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:29,829
I'm computing from my data. That's
perspective A or perspective B is that

462
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839

 

463
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,069

you know I'm not doing something right

464
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
you know I'm not doing something right
 

465
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,910
you know I'm not doing something right
like you know nothing is changing in my

466
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
like you know nothing is changing in my
 

467
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,310
like you know nothing is changing in my
network if nothing is changing there's

468
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
network if nothing is changing there's
 

469
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,150
network if nothing is changing there's
no way that this random initialization I

470
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
no way that this random initialization I
 

471
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,310
no way that this random initialization I
picked correctly this just happened to

472
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
picked correctly this just happened to
 

473
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,230
picked correctly this just happened to
be somewhere I'm not using the full

474
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
be somewhere I'm not using the full
 

475
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,790
be somewhere I'm not using the full
power of this thing how can I optimize

476
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:44,800
power of this thing how can I optimize
 

477
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,790
power of this thing how can I optimize
better to be able to use the full power

478
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
better to be able to use the full power
 

479
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,190
better to be able to use the full power
of this thing okay so is everyone with

480
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,200
of this thing okay so is everyone with
 

481
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,110
of this thing okay so is everyone with
me on just this observation if I have a

482
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
me on just this observation if I have a
 

483
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,189
me on just this observation if I have a
network and I randomly initialize it and

484
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
network and I randomly initialize it and
 

485
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,629
network and I randomly initialize it and
I'm you know uh training it and somehow

486
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
I'm you know uh training it and somehow
 

487
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,470
I'm you know uh training it and somehow
I'm getting

488
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
I'm getting
 

489
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,670
I'm getting
uh better function fits but my

490
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
uh better function fits but my
 

491
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,030
uh better function fits but my
parameters are not changing very much.

492
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
parameters are not changing very much.
 

493
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,829
parameters are not changing very much.
Are you with me that maybe something

494
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
Are you with me that maybe something
 

495
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,509
Are you with me that maybe something
might be wrong? There's no guarantee but

496
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
might be wrong? There's no guarantee but
 

497
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,350
might be wrong? There's no guarantee but
it's it's way worth investigating if

498
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
it's it's way worth investigating if
 

499
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,150
it's it's way worth investigating if
something is off. Yeah. Okay.

500
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
something is off. Yeah. Okay.
 

501
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,230
something is off. Yeah. Okay.

are you saying Over the whole training
 

505
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,230
are you saying Over the whole training

513
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,389
the weights barely change. Yeah, that's
a good question. So, it's true that you

514
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:30,399
a good question. So, it's true that you
 

515
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,870
a good question. So, it's true that you
know if I have a large training run at

516
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
know if I have a large training run at
 

517
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,629
know if I have a large training run at
every step they might barely change but

518
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
every step they might barely change but
 

519
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,470
every step they might barely change but
over a long time they might change by a

520
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
over a long time they might change by a
 

521
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,550
over a long time they might change by a
lot. But here what we're seeing is that

522
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
lot. But here what we're seeing is that
 

523
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,550
lot. But here what we're seeing is that
even over the whole training run they're

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
even over the whole training run they're
 

525
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,829
even over the whole training run they're
not changing by a lot.

I'm confused because when we talked

532
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
I'm confused because when we talked
 

533
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,990
I'm confused because when we talked
about the lazy training assumption I

534

about the lazy training assumption I
 

535
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,670
about the lazy training assumption I
thought it was in the context of the

536
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
thought it was in the context of the
 

537
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,430
thought it was in the context of the
tailor expansion of the function with

tailor expansion of the function with
 

539

respect of the loss function with
 

541
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,550
respect of the loss function with
respect to the parameters and that that

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
respect to the parameters and that that
 

543
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,629
respect to the parameters and that that
only the first degree approximation only

00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
only the first degree approximation only
 

545
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,030
only the first degree approximation only
holds within a small change of the

00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
holds within a small change of the
 

547
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,550
holds within a small change of the
parameters. I'm failing to see the

548
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
parameters. I'm failing to see the
 

549
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,110
parameters. I'm failing to see the
connection.

550
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
connection.
 

551
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,949
connection.
>> So okay there these are two separate

00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
>> So okay there these are two separate
 

553
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,710
>> So okay there these are two separate
things but they're connected. Okay, so

554
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
things but they're connected. Okay, so
 

555
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,069
things but they're connected. Okay, so
thing A is that let me actually just so

556
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
thing A is that let me actually just so
 

557
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,870
thing A is that let me actually just so
thing A is that we have this linearized

558
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
thing A is that we have this linearized
 

559
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,710
thing A is that we have this linearized
perspective on our network and we say we

560
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
perspective on our network and we say we
 

561
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,910
perspective on our network and we say we
want to say that this linear

562
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
want to say that this linear
 

563
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,790
want to say that this linear
approximation is good enough and so we

564
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
approximation is good enough and so we
 

565
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,629
approximation is good enough and so we
say that within this local linear uh or

566
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639
say that within this local linear uh or
 

567
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,790
say that within this local linear uh or
if we if we don't change by change by

568
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
if we if we don't change by change by
 

569
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,629
if we if we don't change by change by
enough we're going to be good. Okay,

570
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
enough we're going to be good. Okay,
 

571
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,829
enough we're going to be good. Okay,
that's perspective A.

572
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
that's perspective A.
 

573
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,230
that's perspective A.
The other thing is this empirical real

574
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
The other thing is this empirical real
 

575
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,990
The other thing is this empirical real
observation that you're running an

576
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
observation that you're running an
 

577
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,550
observation that you're running an
optimizer and stuff isn't changing.

578
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
optimizer and stuff isn't changing.
 

579
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,990
optimizer and stuff isn't changing.
So these are two different things. One

580
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
So these are two different things. One
 

581
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,150
So these are two different things. One
is a kind of a theoretical modeling

582
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
is a kind of a theoretical modeling
 

583
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,910
is a kind of a theoretical modeling
assumption. The other is a real thing

584
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:53,920
assumption. The other is a real thing
 

585
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,509
assumption. The other is a real thing
that you see. Okay. But they're talking

586
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
that you see. Okay. But they're talking
 

587
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,030
that you see. Okay. But they're talking
about the same thing. Okay.

588
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
about the same thing. Okay.
 

589
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,710
about the same thing. Okay.
Okay. So I'm gonna I'll I'll keep coming

590
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
Okay. So I'm gonna I'll I'll keep coming
 

591
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,990
Okay. So I'm gonna I'll I'll keep coming
back to this throughout the lecture.

592
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
back to this throughout the lecture.
 

593
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,389
back to this throughout the lecture.
Okay. I'm going to start uh start going

594
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
Okay. I'm going to start uh start going
 

595
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,350
Okay. I'm going to start uh start going
forward. But what we have is that so

596
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
forward. But what we have is that so
 

597
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,350
forward. But what we have is that so
remember we have some parameters theta.

598
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
remember we have some parameters theta.
 

599
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,910
remember we have some parameters theta.
We have our data x and we have a loss

600
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
We have our data x and we have a loss
 

601
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,550
We have our data x and we have a loss
function that is a function of both our

602
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
function that is a function of both our
 

603
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,590
function that is a function of both our
training data and our parameters. Okay.

604
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
training data and our parameters. Okay.
 

605
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,550
training data and our parameters. Okay.
And we have this linearized perspective

606
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
And we have this linearized perspective
 

607
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,389
And we have this linearized perspective
that we're taking where I'm looking at

608
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
that we're taking where I'm looking at
 

609
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,629
that we're taking where I'm looking at
the loss

610
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
the loss
 

611
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,949
the loss
and I'm looking I'm saying well what how

612
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
and I'm looking I'm saying well what how
 

613
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,910
and I'm looking I'm saying well what how
does my loss change when I have some

614
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
does my loss change when I have some
 

615
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,629
does my loss change when I have some
small change delta theta to my actual

616
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
small change delta theta to my actual
 

617
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,550
small change delta theta to my actual
parameterization. Okay.

618
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
parameterization. Okay.
 

619
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,069
parameterization. Okay.
What is happening when gradient descent

620
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
What is happening when gradient descent
 

621
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,790
What is happening when gradient descent
takes a step. So we talked about this

622
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
takes a step. So we talked about this
 

623
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,230
takes a step. So we talked about this
last time and we talked about the

624
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
last time and we talked about the
 

625
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,389
last time and we talked about the
tension that is that is present in

626
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
tension that is that is present in
 

627
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,710
tension that is that is present in
gradient descent. Fundamentally, we want

628
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
gradient descent. Fundamentally, we want
 

629
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,550
gradient descent. Fundamentally, we want
to have gradient descent be able to take

630
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
to have gradient descent be able to take
 

631
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,670
to have gradient descent be able to take
a step that is small enough so that the

632
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
a step that is small enough so that the
 

633
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,990
a step that is small enough so that the
gradient, the local geometry still

634
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
gradient, the local geometry still
 

635
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,350
gradient, the local geometry still
holds, right? Because we're

636
00:16:59,350 --> 00:16:59,360
holds, right? Because we're
 

637
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,470
holds, right? Because we're
approximating our uh loss function in

638
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
approximating our uh loss function in
 

639
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,710
approximating our uh loss function in
this local linear perspective, but we

640
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
this local linear perspective, but we
 

641
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,309
this local linear perspective, but we
also want to converge fast. So there's a

642
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
also want to converge fast. So there's a
 

643
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,949
also want to converge fast. So there's a
trade-off between you, part of you wants

644
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
trade-off between you, part of you wants
 

645
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,870
trade-off between you, part of you wants
to take really big steps, part of you

646
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
to take really big steps, part of you
 

647
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,309
to take really big steps, part of you
wants to be conservative and make sure

648
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
wants to be conservative and make sure
 

649
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,150
wants to be conservative and make sure
your approximation is still valid.

650
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
your approximation is still valid.
 

651
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,549
your approximation is still valid.
And so what I'm going to do for the rest

652
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
And so what I'm going to do for the rest
 

653
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,949
And so what I'm going to do for the rest
of this for a bunch of this lecture is

654
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
of this for a bunch of this lecture is
 

655
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,429
of this for a bunch of this lecture is
I'm following a uh perspective that's

656
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
I'm following a uh perspective that's
 

657
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,669
I'm following a uh perspective that's
been laid out by uh this paper from

658
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
been laid out by uh this paper from
 

659
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,390
been laid out by uh this paper from
Bernstein and New House just from last

660
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
Bernstein and New House just from last
 

661
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,110
Bernstein and New House just from last
year 2024. They of course build on many

662
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
year 2024. They of course build on many
 

663
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,630
year 2024. They of course build on many
many other works but we're trying to

664
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
many other works but we're trying to
 

665
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,150
many other works but we're trying to
distill the ideas from this paper um in

666
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
distill the ideas from this paper um in
 

667
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,590
distill the ideas from this paper um in
the lecture. Okay.

668
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
the lecture. Okay.
 

669
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,510
the lecture. Okay.
So what the perspective we want to take

670
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520
So what the perspective we want to take
 

671
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,909
So what the perspective we want to take
is we want to try and capture this

672
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:45,919
is we want to try and capture this
 

673
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,990
is we want to try and capture this
gradient descent

674
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
gradient descent
 

675
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,110
gradient descent
from the perspective of finding the

676
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
from the perspective of finding the
 

677
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,110
from the perspective of finding the
right way to think about the optimizer.

678
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
right way to think about the optimizer.
 

679
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,710
right way to think about the optimizer.
And so let's say you have this loss

680
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
And so let's say you have this loss
 

681
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,630
And so let's say you have this loss
function. You're averaging this now over

682
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,640
function. You're averaging this now over
 

683
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,590
function. You're averaging this now over
all of your data points. And we talked

684
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:01,600
all of your data points. And we talked
 

685
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,510
all of your data points. And we talked
last time about well we're trying to

686
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
last time about well we're trying to
 

687
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,270
last time about well we're trying to
minimize our loss function. We're

688
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
minimize our loss function. We're
 

689
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,390
minimize our loss function. We're
looking at this

690
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
looking at this
 

691
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,230
looking at this
linear approximation to our loss

692
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
linear approximation to our loss
 

693
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,950
linear approximation to our loss
function and we want to say well I want

694
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
function and we want to say well I want
 

695
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,110
function and we want to say well I want
to do this while making sure that my

696
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
to do this while making sure that my
 

697
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,350
to do this while making sure that my
step is not too big right so I'm putting

698
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
step is not too big right so I'm putting
 

699
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,590
step is not too big right so I'm putting
this constraint

700
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
this constraint
 

701
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,510
this constraint
and then we talked about the fact that

702
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
and then we talked about the fact that
 

703
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,590
and then we talked about the fact that
well if I look at this this first term

704
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
well if I look at this this first term
 

705
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,350
well if I look at this this first term
here L of theta does it depend on delta

706
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
here L of theta does it depend on delta
 

707
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,549
here L of theta does it depend on delta
theta

708
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559

 

709
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,950

it does not right what What is my

710
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
it does not right what What is my
 

711
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,549
it does not right what What is my
optimization parameter? Delta theta. So

712
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559
optimization parameter? Delta theta. So
 

713
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,110
optimization parameter? Delta theta. So
this does not affect I can just

714
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,120
this does not affect I can just
 

715
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,710
this does not affect I can just
completely drop this right and does not

716
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
completely drop this right and does not
 

717
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,190
completely drop this right and does not
affect the argument. Everyone with me

718
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200
affect the argument. Everyone with me
 

719
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,110
affect the argument. Everyone with me
there?

720
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
there?
 

721
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,590
there?
Okay. So I can really just look at this

722
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
Okay. So I can really just look at this
 

723
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,230
Okay. So I can really just look at this
inner product term here

724
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
inner product term here
 

725
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,270
inner product term here
and that is enough for me to be able to

726
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
and that is enough for me to be able to
 

727
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,549
and that is enough for me to be able to
understand the solution to this

728
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
understand the solution to this
 

729
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,950
understand the solution to this
optimization problem.

730
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
optimization problem.
 

731
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,870
optimization problem.
Everyone with me? Thumbs up, thumbs

732
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
Everyone with me? Thumbs up, thumbs
 

733
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,390
Everyone with me? Thumbs up, thumbs
down.

734
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400
down.
 

735
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,029
down.
Okay.

736
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039

 

737
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,230

So we said what is the key? What is one

738
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
So we said what is the key? What is one
 

739
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,669
So we said what is the key? What is one
of the things that we have to do here?

740
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
of the things that we have to do here?
 

741
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,390
of the things that we have to do here?
Well, we have to understand what do we

742
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
Well, we have to understand what do we
 

743
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,190
Well, we have to understand what do we
mean by take a step that's small enough

744
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,200
mean by take a step that's small enough
 

745
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,909
mean by take a step that's small enough
in what sense? In what norm sense,

746
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919
in what sense? In what norm sense,
 

747
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,510
in what sense? In what norm sense,
right? That's a choice that we get to

748
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
right? That's a choice that we get to
 

749
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,549
right? That's a choice that we get to
make because that's that's inducing

750
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
make because that's that's inducing
 

751
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,950
make because that's that's inducing
basically the behavior of the optimizer.

752
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:28,960
basically the behavior of the optimizer.
 

753
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,470
basically the behavior of the optimizer.
That's that's inducing a bias on how

754
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
That's that's inducing a bias on how
 

755
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,390
That's that's inducing a bias on how
this optimizer is going to actually take

756
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
this optimizer is going to actually take
 

757
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,110
this optimizer is going to actually take
steps. and different geometries that are

758
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
steps. and different geometries that are
 

759
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,110
steps. and different geometries that are
that come from different norms might be

760
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
that come from different norms might be
 

761
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,270
that come from different norms might be
compatible with perhaps different

762
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,280
compatible with perhaps different
 

763
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,150
compatible with perhaps different
architectures for your network. So

764
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,160
architectures for your network. So
 

765
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,950
architectures for your network. So
making these choices explicit is an is a

766
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960
making these choices explicit is an is a
 

767
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,789
making these choices explicit is an is a
good thing. We might not know exactly

768
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
good thing. We might not know exactly
 

769
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,190
good thing. We might not know exactly
what the what the impact of our choices

770
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,200
what the what the impact of our choices
 

771
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,110
what the what the impact of our choices
is but knowing that we have these

772
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
is but knowing that we have these
 

773
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,830
is but knowing that we have these
choices of choosing different norms is a

774
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
choices of choosing different norms is a
 

775
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,430
choices of choosing different norms is a
good and important thing. Okay, everyone

776
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
good and important thing. Okay, everyone
 

777
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,630
good and important thing. Okay, everyone
with me that we can choose a norm here.

778
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
with me that we can choose a norm here.
 

779
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,230
with me that we can choose a norm here.
Okay.

780
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
Okay.
 

781
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,909
Okay.
So what was the first choice that we

782
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
So what was the first choice that we
 

783
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,310
So what was the first choice that we
decided to make?

784
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
decided to make?
 

785
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,789
decided to make?
Well, we said

786
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:06,799
Well, we said
 

787
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,310
Well, we said
let's choose first the infinity norm.

788
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
let's choose first the infinity norm.
 

789
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,029
let's choose first the infinity norm.
Okay. And so now when I choose this

790
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,039
Okay. And so now when I choose this
 

791
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,270
Okay. And so now when I choose this
infinity norm,

792
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
infinity norm,
 

793
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,710
infinity norm,
what do I get? I get this function to be

794
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
what do I get? I get this function to be
 

795
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,190
what do I get? I get this function to be
let me write it here.

796
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200

 

797
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:34,310

I get this to be args

798
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320

 

799
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:42,070

this inner product.

800
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080

 

801
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,590

Okay,

802
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600

 

803
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,909

so let's look at this. What kind of term

804
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:47,919
so let's look at this. What kind of term
 

805
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,149
so let's look at this. What kind of term
is this term here?

806
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
is this term here?
 

807
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,190
is this term here?
My variable is delta theta.

808
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200

 

809
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,110

This is probably this is exactly like a

810
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
This is probably this is exactly like a
 

811
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,310
This is probably this is exactly like a
problem that you've seen in 127 where

812
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320
problem that you've seen in 127 where
 

813
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,310
problem that you've seen in 127 where
you have

814
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
you have
 

815
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,909
you have
xrpose y here

816
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:05,919
xrpose y here
 

817
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,789
xrpose y here
and then you might have

818
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:08,799
and then you might have
 

819
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:17,590
and then you might have
um

820
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,600

 

821
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,789

right so if I write it like this maybe

822
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:20,799
right so if I write it like this maybe
 

823
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,909
right so if I write it like this maybe
it looks like something more famili

824
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
it looks like something more famili
 

825
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,070
it looks like something more famili
amilar. But what kind of program is

826
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
amilar. But what kind of program is
 

827
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,590
amilar. But what kind of program is
this? What kind of optimization problem

828
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
this? What kind of optimization problem
 

829
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,390
this? What kind of optimization problem
is this? It's a linear program, right?

830
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
is this? It's a linear program, right?
 

831
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,630
is this? It's a linear program, right?
My objective is linear. And if you look

832
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
My objective is linear. And if you look
 

833
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,110
My objective is linear. And if you look
at all of my constraints,

834
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,120
at all of my constraints,
 

835
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,510
at all of my constraints,
I can also write them there. These are

836
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520
I can also write them there. These are
 

837
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,270
I can also write them there. These are
also linear constraints, right? In fact,

838
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,280
also linear constraints, right? In fact,
 

839
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,590
also linear constraints, right? In fact,
this infinity norm just says I have a

840
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
this infinity norm just says I have a
 

841
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,350
this infinity norm just says I have a
constraint on every single component of

842
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
constraint on every single component of
 

843
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,789
constraint on every single component of
my vector. The infinity norm is saying

844
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
my vector. The infinity norm is saying
 

845
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,669
my vector. The infinity norm is saying
that I have to be within this unit hyper

846
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:49,679
that I have to be within this unit hyper
 

847
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,029
that I have to be within this unit hyper
cube. For example, here I've drawn it

848
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:51,039
cube. For example, here I've drawn it
 

849
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,350
cube. For example, here I've drawn it
out only for two dimensions. The largest

850
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
out only for two dimensions. The largest
 

851
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,830
out only for two dimensions. The largest
element, the maximum element must be

852
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:55,840
element, the maximum element must be
 

853
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,549
element, the maximum element must be
less than uh ADA in its absolute value.

854
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:00,559
less than uh ADA in its absolute value.
 

855
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,549
less than uh ADA in its absolute value.
So I have a linear program, linear

856
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:02,559
So I have a linear program, linear
 

857
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,710
So I have a linear program, linear
objective, linear constraints. So what

858
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
objective, linear constraints. So what
 

859
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,029
objective, linear constraints. So what
does that tell me about the solution to

860
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
does that tell me about the solution to
 

861
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:14,390
does that tell me about the solution to
my optimum?

862
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:14,400

 

863
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,990

What do I know just from optimization

864
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:16,000
What do I know just from optimization
 

865
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,590
What do I know just from optimization
theory?

866
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
theory?
 

867
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,149
theory?
>> Yeah, at the back. go boundary of the

868
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
>> Yeah, at the back. go boundary of the
 

869
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:20,950
>> Yeah, at the back. go boundary of the
constraints,

870
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
constraints,
 

871
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,230
constraints,
>> right? I'm going to hit a boundary,

872
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:22,240
>> right? I'm going to hit a boundary,
 

873
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,310
>> right? I'm going to hit a boundary,
right? My optimum is going to be at a

874
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
right? My optimum is going to be at a
 

875
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,430
right? My optimum is going to be at a
boundary. And if I'm if I if my if my

876
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
boundary. And if I'm if I if my if my
 

877
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,789
boundary. And if I'm if I if my if my
domain was somehow unconstrained, I

878
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
domain was somehow unconstrained, I
 

879
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,350
domain was somehow unconstrained, I
could go off to infinity. But if not,

880
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:31,360
could go off to infinity. But if not,
 

881
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,950
could go off to infinity. But if not,
basically, if I have a linear objective,

882
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
basically, if I have a linear objective,
 

883
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,310
basically, if I have a linear objective,
I'm just going to follow the gradient in

884
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
I'm just going to follow the gradient in
 

885
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,430
I'm just going to follow the gradient in
the direction and I'm going to keep

886
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,440
the direction and I'm going to keep
 

887
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,830
the direction and I'm going to keep
improving my objective. And the only way

888
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840
improving my objective. And the only way
 

889
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,029
improving my objective. And the only way
I'm going to stop is I hit some

890
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
I'm going to stop is I hit some
 

891
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,830
I'm going to stop is I hit some
constraint.

892
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
constraint.
 

893
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,510
constraint.
So that perspective, I'm just trying to

894
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
So that perspective, I'm just trying to
 

895
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,870
So that perspective, I'm just trying to
give a different perspective from the

896
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880
give a different perspective from the
 

897
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,909
give a different perspective from the
one that we talked about this

898
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
one that we talked about this
 

899
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,630
one that we talked about this
optimization problem in the last class.

900
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
optimization problem in the last class.
 

901
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,549
optimization problem in the last class.
But that perspective says, look, I'm

902
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
But that perspective says, look, I'm
 

903
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,029
But that perspective says, look, I'm
going to keep hitting my boundaries.

904
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
going to keep hitting my boundaries.
 

905
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,350
going to keep hitting my boundaries.
And which boundary am I going to hit?

906
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
And which boundary am I going to hit?
 

907
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,029
And which boundary am I going to hit?
Well, I'm trying to minimize this thing.

908
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039

 

909
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,029

And so I want to make it as small as

910
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,039
And so I want to make it as small as
 

911
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,710
And so I want to make it as small as
possible. So I want to make it negative,

912
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:04,720
possible. So I want to make it negative,
 

913
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,070
possible. So I want to make it negative,
right?

914
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
right?
 

915
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,230
right?
So if my actual if the component in my

916
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
So if my actual if the component in my
 

917
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,669
So if my actual if the component in my
gradient is negative then I want my

918
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
gradient is negative then I want my
 

919
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,350
gradient is negative then I want my
delta theta to have a component that is

920
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
delta theta to have a component that is
 

921
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,789
delta theta to have a component that is
positive. I want the product to be

922
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
positive. I want the product to be
 

923
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,110
positive. I want the product to be
negative right

924
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
negative right
 

925
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,510
negative right
and if my component is negative then I

926
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
and if my component is negative then I
 

927
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,110
and if my component is negative then I
want to have a delta theta or if my

928
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,120
want to have a delta theta or if my
 

929
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,390
want to have a delta theta or if my
component is positive then I want to

930
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
component is positive then I want to
 

931
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,990
component is positive then I want to
have a delta theta that is actually

932
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
have a delta theta that is actually
 

933
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,230
have a delta theta that is actually
negative.

934
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,240
negative.
 

935
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,630
negative.
Does everyone see this?

936
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640

 

937
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,750

So what the solution ends up being just

938
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
So what the solution ends up being just
 

939
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,390
So what the solution ends up being just
one concise way to write this is to say

940
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
one concise way to write this is to say
 

941
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,230
one concise way to write this is to say
look at your gradient vector look at the

942
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,240
look at your gradient vector look at the
 

943
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,750
look at your gradient vector look at the
signs of all of the entries and use that

944
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
signs of all of the entries and use that
 

945
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,950
signs of all of the entries and use that
basically as your gradient step. Okay

946
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:50,960
basically as your gradient step. Okay
 

947
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,470
basically as your gradient step. Okay
everyone with me on this questions about

948
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
everyone with me on this questions about
 

949
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,149
everyone with me on this questions about
this? I'm going to pause here.

950
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
this? I'm going to pause here.
 

951
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,270
this? I'm going to pause here.
>> Yes. Wait, isn't this saying though that

952
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,280
>> Yes. Wait, isn't this saying though that
 

953
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,430
>> Yes. Wait, isn't this saying though that
just like in one step I mean you said

954
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
just like in one step I mean you said
 

955
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,510
just like in one step I mean you said
like the lazy training assumption is

956
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
like the lazy training assumption is
 

957
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,430
like the lazy training assumption is
during the whole run but this is saying

958
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440
during the whole run but this is saying
 

959
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,590
during the whole run but this is saying

you will come to a new spot and then you
 

1009

you will come to a new spot and then you
will think about a linearization around

will think about a linearization around
 

1011

at the sign in every entry and go the

optimizer. Okay. And even though you
know when atom first started being used

1120
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:36,880
know when atom first started being used
 

1121
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,269
know when atom first started being used
people hadn't really necessarily thought

1122
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:39,279
people hadn't really necessarily thought
 

1123
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,470
people hadn't really necessarily thought
it it this connection is has come up.

1124
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,480
it it this connection is has come up.
 

1125
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,549
it it this connection is has come up.
this it wasn't that oh we had this

1126
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:44,559
this it wasn't that oh we had this
 

1127
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,070
this it wasn't that oh we had this
perspective and now let's take this

1128
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
perspective and now let's take this
 

1129
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,269
perspective and now let's take this
optimization problem from this

1130
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:47,279
optimization problem from this
 

1131
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,070
optimization problem from this
linearized perspective and then let's

1132
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
linearized perspective and then let's
 

1133
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,830
linearized perspective and then let's
uh apply different norms and see what

1134
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
uh apply different norms and see what
 

1135
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,590
uh apply different norms and see what
optimizers come out and oh Adam came out

1136
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:53,600
optimizers come out and oh Adam came out
 

1137
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,590
optimizers come out and oh Adam came out
and o sin SGD came out that's not how

1138
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600
and o sin SGD came out that's not how
 

1139
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,789
and o sin SGD came out that's not how
this was developed that's how we're

1140
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:56,799
this was developed that's how we're
 

1141
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,389
this was developed that's how we're
presenting it to you but just Adam

1142
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:00,399
presenting it to you but just Adam
 

1143
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,149
presenting it to you but just Adam
showed up right someone came up with the

1144
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:02,159
showed up right someone came up with the
 

1145
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,830
showed up right someone came up with the
idea and it came actually from thinking

1146
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
idea and it came actually from thinking
 

1147
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,430
idea and it came actually from thinking
about other algorithms like uh adrad

1148
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,440
about other algorithms like uh adrad
 

1149
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,190
about other algorithms like uh adrad
which is an adaptive gradient which was

1150
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,200
which is an adaptive gradient which was
 

1151
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,110
which is an adaptive gradient which was
trying to think about this idea that we

1152
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120
trying to think about this idea that we
 

1153
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,549
trying to think about this idea that we
talked about that well the singular

1154
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
talked about that well the singular
 

1155
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,990
talked about that well the singular
values are of different magnitude. So

1156
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,000
values are of different magnitude. So
 

1157
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,310
values are of different magnitude. So
let's try to make them all the same so

1158
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
let's try to make them all the same so
 

1159
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,630
let's try to make them all the same so
that we don't uh have these learning

1160
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:18,640
that we don't uh have these learning
 

1161
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,070
that we don't uh have these learning
rate problems. Everyone remember that

1162
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
rate problems. Everyone remember that
 

1163
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,789
rate problems. Everyone remember that
like that was how atom was developed.

1164
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
like that was how atom was developed.
 

1165
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,590
like that was how atom was developed.
But it turns out one can look at it and

1166
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:25,600
But it turns out one can look at it and
 

1167
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,630
But it turns out one can look at it and
have this perspective

1168
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
have this perspective
 

1169
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,269
have this perspective
that brings about the core idea of Adam

1170
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:31,279
that brings about the core idea of Adam
 

1171
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,070
that brings about the core idea of Adam
which is sin SGD from this different

1172
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,080
which is sin SGD from this different
 

1173
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,470
which is sin SGD from this different
way. Is that clear to everyone?

1174
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:38,480
way. Is that clear to everyone?
 

1175
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,389
way. Is that clear to everyone?
Okay. So what I want you to get is the

1176
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
Okay. So what I want you to get is the
 

1177
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,070
Okay. So what I want you to get is the
perspective. The math is also important

1178
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
perspective. The math is also important
 

1179
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,350
perspective. The math is also important
but the perspective is equally important

1180
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,360
but the perspective is equally important
 

1181
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,110
but the perspective is equally important
with me. Excellent. Okay. So now you had

1182
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
with me. Excellent. Okay. So now you had
 

1183
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,029
with me. Excellent. Okay. So now you had
this question about the two norm this

1184
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,039
this question about the two norm this
 

1185
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,389
this question about the two norm this
normalization that you're thinking of

1186
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:52,399
normalization that you're thinking of
 

1187
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,789
normalization that you're thinking of
was going to show up.

1188
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:54,799
was going to show up.
 

1189
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,870
was going to show up.
So that was just one choice. So we could

1190
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880
So that was just one choice. So we could
 

1191
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,669
So that was just one choice. So we could
make another choice, right?

1192
00:28:59,669 --> 00:28:59,679
make another choice, right?
 

1193
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,070
make another choice, right?
Instead of the infinity norm, you know

1194
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,080
Instead of the infinity norm, you know
 

1195
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,750
Instead of the infinity norm, you know
that wasn't even our favorite norm. Our

1196
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:03,760
that wasn't even our favorite norm. Our
 

1197
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,909
that wasn't even our favorite norm. Our
favorite norm is always the my favorite

1198
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:05,919
favorite norm is always the my favorite
 

1199
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,230
favorite norm is always the my favorite
norm, probably your favorite norm is

1200
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,240
norm, probably your favorite norm is
 

1201
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,590
norm, probably your favorite norm is
always the two norm, right? is the

1202
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:09,600
always the two norm, right? is the
 

1203
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,710
always the two norm, right? is the
easiest to work with.

1204
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:12,720
easiest to work with.
 

1205
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,789
easiest to work with.
So instead, we could really think about

1206
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
So instead, we could really think about
 

1207
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,310
So instead, we could really think about
this as the um as the two norm. So

1208
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
this as the um as the two norm. So
 

1209
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,710
this as the um as the two norm. So
actually why don't you take a minute and

1210
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:20,720
actually why don't you take a minute and
 

1211
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,710
actually why don't you take a minute and
actually work this out, talk to each

1212
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:22,720
actually work this out, talk to each
 

1213
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,430
actually work this out, talk to each
other and figure out what is the optimal

1214
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
other and figure out what is the optimal
 

1215
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,750
other and figure out what is the optimal
solution to this optimization problem in

1216
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:27,760
solution to this optimization problem in
 

1217
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,909
solution to this optimization problem in
the two norm context.

1218
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,919

 

1219
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,669

Feel free to talk. It's valuable for you

1220
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:35,679
Feel free to talk. It's valuable for you
 

1221
00:29:35,679 --> 00:31:47,190
Feel free to talk. It's valuable for you
to talk.

1222
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,200

 

1223
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:56,789

Okay, there's my timer.

1224
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:56,799

 

1225
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,070

Okay, let's come together. Let's come

1226
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,080
Okay, let's come together. Let's come
 

1227
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,149
Okay, let's come together. Let's come
together.

1228
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:00,159
together.
 

1229
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,630
together.
So,

1230
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:04,640

 

1231
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,990

let's think about this two norm

1232
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
let's think about this two norm
 

1233
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,509
let's think about this two norm
together.

1234
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:07,519
together.
 

1235
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,710
together.
This is something that you've seen

1236
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
This is something that you've seen
 

1237
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,950
This is something that you've seen
before in some sense. Right?

1238
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:10,960
before in some sense. Right?
 

1239
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,669
before in some sense. Right?
Now when I look at this

1240
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:13,679
Now when I look at this
 

1241
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,830
Now when I look at this
is this

1242
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:15,840
is this
 

1243
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,870
is this
is this a linear program?

1244
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880

 

1245
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,789

No. Why is it not a linear program? Just

1246
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:22,799
No. Why is it not a linear program? Just
 

1247
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,470
No. Why is it not a linear program? Just
refresher.

1248
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,480
refresher.
 

1249
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,990

1269
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,470
because I'm having my norm be uh bounded

00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
directions, let's say this is one
 

1277
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,950
directions, let's say this is one
direction and I'm trying to find a

1278
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:04,960
direction and I'm trying to find a
 

1279
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,990
direction and I'm trying to find a
direction that has the minimum inner

1280
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
direction that has the minimum inner
 

1281
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,310
direction that has the minimum inner
product with this. Okay,

1282
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,320
product with this. Okay,
 

1283
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,149
product with this. Okay,
so what are my choices? Well, what does

1284
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:12,159
so what are my choices? Well, what does
 

1285
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,669
so what are my choices? Well, what does
the inner what is the inner product? I

1286
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:13,679
the inner what is the inner product? I
 

1287
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,870
the inner what is the inner product? I
can write out the inner product

1288
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:14,880
can write out the inner product
 

1289
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,710
can write out the inner product
explicitly, right? In terms of the angle

1290
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,720
explicitly, right? In terms of the angle
 

1291
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,950
explicitly, right? In terms of the angle
between the two vectors.

1292
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
between the two vectors.
 

1293
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,830
between the two vectors.
So I can really write out this in this

1294
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:21,840
So I can really write out this in this
 

1295
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,269
So I can really write out this in this
way. Xrpose Y is just the norm of X norm

1296
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
way. Xrpose Y is just the norm of X norm
 

1297
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,190
way. Xrpose Y is just the norm of X norm
of Y times the cosine of the angle

1298
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,200
of Y times the cosine of the angle
 

1299
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,509
of Y times the cosine of the angle
between the two vectors.

1300
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:29,519
between the two vectors.
 

1301
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,509
between the two vectors.
So if I wanted to maximize this inner

1302
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:31,519
So if I wanted to maximize this inner
 

1303
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,029
So if I wanted to maximize this inner
product, what do I want that cosine to

1304
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
product, what do I want that cosine to
 

1305
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,430
product, what do I want that cosine to
be?

1306
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:37,440

 

1307
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,870

>> If I wanted to maximize it, I want the

1308
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
>> If I wanted to maximize it, I want the
 

1309
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,509
>> If I wanted to maximize it, I want the
cosine to be zero.

1310
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
cosine to be zero.
 

1311
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,669
cosine to be zero.
>> I want the co you want the angle to be

1312
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:43,679
>> I want the co you want the angle to be
 

1313
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,070
>> I want the co you want the angle to be
zero, but you want the cosine to be one,

1314
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,080
zero, but you want the cosine to be one,
 

1315
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,710
zero, but you want the cosine to be one,
right? And if I wanted to minimize it, I

1316
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:48,720
right? And if I wanted to minimize it, I
 

1317
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,789
right? And if I wanted to minimize it, I
want them to be exactly opposite to each

1318
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:50,799
want them to be exactly opposite to each
 

1319
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,710
want them to be exactly opposite to each
other. So that I want the cosine to be

1320
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
other. So that I want the cosine to be
 

1321
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,110
other. So that I want the cosine to be
negative one, right?

1322
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,120
negative one, right?
 

1323
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,870
negative one, right?
being orthogonal would mean that my

1324
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:56,880
being orthogonal would mean that my
 

1325
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,549
being orthogonal would mean that my
cosine is exactly zero.

1326
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:00,559
cosine is exactly zero.
 

1327
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,470
cosine is exactly zero.
So to minimize this I want to have

1328
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:02,480
So to minimize this I want to have
 

1329
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,269
So to minimize this I want to have
choose these vectors that are pointing

1330
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:05,279
choose these vectors that are pointing
 

1331
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,230
choose these vectors that are pointing
exactly in the opposite direction.

1332
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,240
exactly in the opposite direction.
 

1333
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,310
exactly in the opposite direction.
And so we know from koshwarz or you know

1334
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:10,320
And so we know from koshwarz or you know
 

1335
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,710
And so we know from koshwarz or you know

whatever whatever particular way you
like remembering this fact whether it's

like remembering this fact whether it's
 

1339
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,869
like remembering this fact whether it's

00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,240

your vectors are just either aligned uh

1348
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
your vectors are just either aligned uh
 

1349
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,950
your vectors are just either aligned uh
or anti-aligned okay in this case

1350
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:26,960
or anti-aligned okay in this case
 

1351
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,470
or anti-aligned okay in this case
because we're looking for the arg min we

1352
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,480
because we're looking for the arg min we
 

1353
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,869
because we're looking for the arg min we
want them to be anti-aligned

1354
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879
want them to be anti-aligned
 

1355
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,349
want them to be anti-aligned
so what does that mean so I what I need

1356
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:33,359
so what does that mean so I what I need
 

1357
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:40,950
so what does that mean so I what I need
to do is I need to say Look

1358
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:40,960

 

1359
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,149

to take the best to find the best vector

1360
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:44,159
to take the best to find the best vector
 

1361
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,790
to take the best to find the best vector
take your current vector and normalize

1362
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
take your current vector and normalize
 

1363
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,470
take your current vector and normalize
it. Okay, so my vector is this gradient

1364
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:52,480
it. Okay, so my vector is this gradient
 

1365
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,430
it. Okay, so my vector is this gradient
and then I'm normalizing it to make it

1366
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,440
and then I'm normalizing it to make it
 

1367
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,310
and then I'm normalizing it to make it
into a unit vector. Does everyone see

1368
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
into a unit vector. Does everyone see
 

1369
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,190
into a unit vector. Does everyone see
that?

1370
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
that?
 

1371
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,430
that?
And then I scale it so that it's exactly

1372
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
And then I scale it so that it's exactly
 

1373
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,109
And then I scale it so that it's exactly
magnitude ADA. So this has norm one

1374
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:07,119
magnitude ADA. So this has norm one
 

1375
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,950
magnitude ADA. So this has norm one
multiplied by this and now it has norm

1376
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:08,960
multiplied by this and now it has norm
 

1377
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,670
multiplied by this and now it has norm
ada. So it's exactly within that ada

1378
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:11,680
ada. So it's exactly within that ada
 

1379
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,710
ada. So it's exactly within that ada
ball bulb.

1380
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:16,720

 

1381
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,750

So when I look at this step is this the

1382
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:19,760
So when I look at this step is this the
 

1383
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,550
So when I look at this step is this the
step of gradient descent.

1384
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:24,560

 

1385
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,310

It is not quite the step of gradient

1386
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
It is not quite the step of gradient
 

1387
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,990
It is not quite the step of gradient
descent. Right? What is the difference?

1388
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
descent. Right? What is the difference?
 

1389
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,790
descent. Right? What is the difference?
If I wanted to do gradient descent I

1390
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:32,800
If I wanted to do gradient descent I
 

1391
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,390
If I wanted to do gradient descent I
would not have this term here. Right?

1392
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,400
would not have this term here. Right?
 

1393
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,349
would not have this term here. Right?
Right? I would cancel this out. That

1394
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:37,359
Right? I would cancel this out. That
 

1395
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,790
Right? I would cancel this out. That
would make it exactly like a gradient

1396
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:38,800
would make it exactly like a gradient
 

1397
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,030
would make it exactly like a gradient
descent step. So what I have here is

1398
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,040
descent step. So what I have here is
 

1399
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,710
descent step. So what I have here is
basically a normalized version of

1400
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:42,720
basically a normalized version of
 

1401
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,550
basically a normalized version of
gradient descent. The direction I'm

1402
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:44,560
gradient descent. The direction I'm
 

1403
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,109
gradient descent. The direction I'm
moving in is exactly the same, but the

1404
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:47,119
moving in is exactly the same, but the
 

1405
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,430
moving in is exactly the same, but the
distance that I'm moving is slightly

1406
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:49,440
distance that I'm moving is slightly
 

1407
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,990
distance that I'm moving is slightly
different. If I think of ADA as being my

1408
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,000
different. If I think of ADA as being my
 

1409
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,790
different. If I think of ADA as being my
step size or my learning rate, I could

1410
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:56,800
step size or my learning rate, I could
 

1411
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,390
step size or my learning rate, I could
reimagine this and think about

1412
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,400
reimagine this and think about
 

1413
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,910
reimagine this and think about
this as my step size. ADA divided by

1414
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:03,920
this as my step size. ADA divided by
 

1415
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,910
this as my step size. ADA divided by
this norm of the gradient

1416
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:07,920
this norm of the gradient
 

1417
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,510
this norm of the gradient
and I could I could think of this as

1418
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:09,520
and I could I could think of this as
 

1419
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,750
and I could I could think of this as
gradient descent in that sense. Okay.

1420
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:13,760
gradient descent in that sense. Okay.
 

1421
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,349
gradient descent in that sense. Okay.
But I can just really think about this

1422
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,359
But I can just really think about this
 

1423
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,270
But I can just really think about this
in a slightly different perspective

1424
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,280
in a slightly different perspective
 

1425
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,270
in a slightly different perspective
which is instead of thinking about this

1426
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
which is instead of thinking about this
 

1427
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,589
which is instead of thinking about this
problem as this constrained optimization

1428
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:21,599
problem as this constrained optimization
 

1429
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,069
problem as this constrained optimization
problem actually first any questions

00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:24,079
problem actually first any questions
 

1431
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,190
problem actually first any questions
about this? Are we good with this?

1432
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,200
about this? Are we good with this?
 

1433
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,790
about this? Are we good with this?
This is 16A stuff.

1434
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
This is 16A stuff.
 

1435
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,069
This is 16A stuff.
Okay, good.

1436
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079

 

1437
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,670

Instead of looking this as a constrained

1438
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:37,680
Instead of looking this as a constrained
 

1439
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,270
Instead of looking this as a constrained
optimization problem, I can

1440
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,280
optimization problem, I can
 

1441
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,750
optimization problem, I can
alternatively think about moving my

1442
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:41,760
alternatively think about moving my
 

1443
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,069
alternatively think about moving my
constraint here to be a regularizer or

1444
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:44,079
constraint here to be a regularizer or
 

1445
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,870
constraint here to be a regularizer or
like a lrange multiplier. Right? And now

1446
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:46,880
like a lrange multiplier. Right? And now
 

1447
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,310
like a lrange multiplier. Right? And now
this is a different optimization

1448
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,320
this is a different optimization
 

1449
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,150
this is a different optimization
problem. It's not the same optimization

1450
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,160
problem. It's not the same optimization
 

1451
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,310
problem. It's not the same optimization
problem. But if you remember from a

1452
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,320
problem. But if you remember from a
 

1453
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,950
problem. But if you remember from a
127th homework problem, you did prove

1454
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:54,960
127th homework problem, you did prove
 

1455
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,310
127th homework problem, you did prove
that these two problems sweep out the

1456
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,320
that these two problems sweep out the
 

1457
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,109
that these two problems sweep out the
same set of solutions for appropriate

1458
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:01,119
same set of solutions for appropriate
 

1459
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,310
same set of solutions for appropriate
choice of ADA and lambda. Okay, so the

1460
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,320
choice of ADA and lambda. Okay, so the
 

1461
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,390
choice of ADA and lambda. Okay, so the
family of solutions that are captured by

1462
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,400
family of solutions that are captured by
 

1463
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,430
family of solutions that are captured by
these are exactly the same.

1464
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:09,440
these are exactly the same.
 

1465
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,910
these are exactly the same.
And so I can think of this particular

1466
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:11,920
And so I can think of this particular
 

1467
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,990
And so I can think of this particular
optimization and it's doing the same

1468
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,000
optimization and it's doing the same
 

1469
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,670
optimization and it's doing the same
thing, right? It's basically saying it's

1470
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:15,680
thing, right? It's basically saying it's
 

1471
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,030
thing, right? It's basically saying it's
capturing the same intuition they want

1472
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,040
capturing the same intuition they want
 

1473
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,430
capturing the same intuition they want
to capture, which is that I'm penalizing

1474
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:19,440
to capture, which is that I'm penalizing
 

1475
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,109
to capture, which is that I'm penalizing
you for taking too big of a step. Don't

1476
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:21,119
you for taking too big of a step. Don't
 

1477
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,470
you for taking too big of a step. Don't
take too big of a step, otherwise you're

1478
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:22,480
take too big of a step, otherwise you're
 

1479
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,390
take too big of a step, otherwise you're
going to break your local linearization.

1480
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,400
going to break your local linearization.
 

1481
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,670
going to break your local linearization.
So, it's the same kind of uh thinking

1482
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:27,680
So, it's the same kind of uh thinking
 

1483
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,430
So, it's the same kind of uh thinking
that can go into this optimization

1484
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,440
that can go into this optimization
 

1485
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,030
that can go into this optimization
problem.

1486
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,040
problem.
 

1487
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,870
problem.
But now when I look at this, well, I

1488
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:32,880
But now when I look at this, well, I
 

1489
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,710
But now when I look at this, well, I
know that this is just this function is

1490
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:34,720
know that this is just this function is
 

1491
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,069
know that this is just this function is
convex, right? There's a quadratic here.

1492
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:38,079
convex, right? There's a quadratic here.
 

1493
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,069
convex, right? There's a quadratic here.
Lambda is greater than zero. It's a

1494
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:40,079
Lambda is greater than zero. It's a
 

1495
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,190
Lambda is greater than zero. It's a
parabola that faces upward. So I can

1496
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,200
parabola that faces upward. So I can
 

1497
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,829
parabola that faces upward. So I can
actually just easily compute the optimum

1498
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:45,839
actually just easily compute the optimum
 

1499
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,310
actually just easily compute the optimum
of this

1500
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,320
of this
 

1501
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,030
of this
and I can compute this gradient

1502
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,040
and I can compute this gradient
 

1503
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,710
and I can compute this gradient
which is just uh this vector plus 2

1504
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:56,720
which is just uh this vector plus 2
 

1505
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,670
which is just uh this vector plus 2
lambda delta theta.

1506
00:37:59,670 --> 00:37:59,680
lambda delta theta.
 

1507
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,990
lambda delta theta.
I can set this to zero and I can compute

1508
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,000
I can set this to zero and I can compute
 

1509
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,950
I can set this to zero and I can compute
this minimizer. Okay.

1510
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:04,960
this minimizer. Okay.
 

1511
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,510
this minimizer. Okay.
And now I get basically something that

1512
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:07,520
And now I get basically something that
 

1513
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,349
And now I get basically something that
looks more like the standard gradient

1514
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:09,359
looks more like the standard gradient
 

1515
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,589
looks more like the standard gradient
descent. Right? there's not this uh

1516
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:11,599
descent. Right? there's not this uh
 

1517
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,190
descent. Right? there's not this uh
normalization by the norm uh norm of the

1518
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,200
normalization by the norm uh norm of the
 

1519
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,270
normalization by the norm uh norm of the
gradient which which is a confounding uh

1520
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
gradient which which is a confounding uh
 

1521
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,190
gradient which which is a confounding uh
factor in the way that we wrote it

1522
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200
factor in the way that we wrote it
 

1523
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,150
factor in the way that we wrote it
earlier. Okay.

1524
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,160
earlier. Okay.
 

1525
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,230
earlier. Okay.
But whichever way we look at this the

1526
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,240
But whichever way we look at this the
 

1527
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,230
But whichever way we look at this the
geometry is something that is similar to

1528
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,240
geometry is something that is similar to
 

1529
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,510
geometry is something that is similar to
how we would think about gradient

1530
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:27,520
how we would think about gradient
 

1531
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,589
how we would think about gradient
descent.

1532
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:31,599

 

1533
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,430

Okay.

1534
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:35,440

 

1535
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,230

So everyone with me on the two different

1536
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,240
So everyone with me on the two different
 

1537
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,069
So everyone with me on the two different
ways we can we can think about this

1538
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:40,079
ways we can we can think about this
 

1539
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,829
ways we can we can think about this
constrained optimization problem

1540
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:43,839
constrained optimization problem
 

1541
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,990
constrained optimization problem
and the fact that when we make this

1542
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,000
and the fact that when we make this
 

1543
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,710
and the fact that when we make this
choice of the two norm here

1544
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720

 

1545
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,829

what we get out

1546
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839
what we get out
 

1547
00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:01,190
what we get out
is gradient descent.

1548
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,200

 

1549
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,069

And this perspective, you know, is not

1550
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:04,079
And this perspective, you know, is not
 

1551
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,750
And this perspective, you know, is not
new in the sense that people have known

1552
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
new in the sense that people have known
 

1553
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,750
new in the sense that people have known
this about gradient descent for for a

1554
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:07,760
this about gradient descent for for a
 

1555
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,230
this about gradient descent for for a
long time. But it's interesting to look

1556
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,240
long time. But it's interesting to look
 

1557
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,430
long time. But it's interesting to look
at it in the same vein of family of

1558
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:13,440
at it in the same vein of family of
 

1559
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,750
at it in the same vein of family of
things that we looked at Adam because

1560
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:15,760
things that we looked at Adam because
 

1561
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,190
things that we looked at Adam because
we're going to now continue this

1562
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,200
we're going to now continue this
 

1563
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,670
we're going to now continue this
pattern, right? One can be a fluke, but

1564
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:19,680
pattern, right? One can be a fluke, but
 

1565
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,910
pattern, right? One can be a fluke, but
two, you're starting to see a pattern.

1566
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:21,920
two, you're starting to see a pattern.
 

1567
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,510
two, you're starting to see a pattern.
And now what we want to try to see is

1568
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:23,520
And now what we want to try to see is
 

1569
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,069
And now what we want to try to see is
like is there more to this pattern? What

1570
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:26,079
like is there more to this pattern? What
 

1571
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,750
like is there more to this pattern? What
can we uh what can we learn from this?

1572
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:29,760
can we uh what can we learn from this?
 

1573
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,670
can we uh what can we learn from this?
Okay. So, I'll pause here and take

1574
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:31,680
Okay. So, I'll pause here and take
 

1575
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:42,230
Okay. So, I'll pause here and take
questions.

1576
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240

 

1577
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:51,510

>> Yeah.

1578
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:51,520

 

1579
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,710

>> Not sure I understand. like if we turn

1580
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:54,720
>> Not sure I understand. like if we turn
 

1581
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,870
>> Not sure I understand. like if we turn
our constrained optimization model to

1582
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:56,880
our constrained optimization model to
 

1583
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,870
our constrained optimization model to
the unconstrained like because we have

1584
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:58,880
the unconstrained like because we have
 

1585
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,910
the unconstrained like because we have
to make sure the constraint still holds.

1586
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:01,920
to make sure the constraint still holds.
 

1587
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,109
to make sure the constraint still holds.
So you have to

1588
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:03,119
So you have to
 

1589
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,030
So you have to

1594
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:08,400
optimization problem into this there's
 

1595
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,910
optimization problem into this there's
there's a there's a question of finding

1596
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:09,920
there's a there's a question of finding
 

1597
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,670
there's a there's a question of finding
the right lambda so that you can get the

1598
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:11,680
the right lambda so that you can get the
 

1599
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,670
the right lambda so that you can get the
exact same solutions. I'm not interested

1600
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:13,680
exact same solutions. I'm not interested
 

1601
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,270
exact same solutions. I'm not interested
in matching the solutions. I don't

1602
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:15,280
in matching the solutions. I don't
 

1603
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,430
in matching the solutions. I don't
really care what the value of lambda is

1604
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,440
really care what the value of lambda is
 

1605
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,750
really care what the value of lambda is
to correspond to the ADA. What I'm

1606
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:19,760
to correspond to the ADA. What I'm
 

1607
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,109
to correspond to the ADA. What I'm
interested in pointing out is that

1608
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:23,119
interested in pointing out is that
 

1609
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,030
interested in pointing out is that
you can get the same form of descent

1610
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040
you can get the same form of descent
 

1611
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,870
you can get the same form of descent
algorithm. So yes, there's a there's a

1612
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:26,880
algorithm. So yes, there's a there's a
 

1613
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,390
algorithm. So yes, there's a there's a
subtlety there if you had to pick the

1614
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,400
subtlety there if you had to pick the
 

1615
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,670
subtlety there if you had to pick the
appropriate like you had to match the

1616
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:29,680
appropriate like you had to match the
 

1617
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,109
appropriate like you had to match the
ADA to the lambda to get the same

1618
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:31,119
ADA to the lambda to get the same
 

1619
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,670
ADA to the lambda to get the same
solutions. Absolutely.

1620
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:33,680
solutions. Absolutely.
 

1621
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,710

no I don't see why. Um it's just it's

no I don't see why. Um it's just it's
doing exactly the same thing. It's just

doing exactly the same thing. It's just
 

1641
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,829
doing exactly the same thing. It's just
a function of what you set your step

1642
00:40:59,829 --> 00:40:59,839
a function of what you set your step

that you would apply to SGD or gradient
 

1647
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,510

this perspective is bringing in the

1668
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,240
this perspective is bringing in the
 

1669
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,470
this perspective is bringing in the
magnitude of the gradient and so what

1670
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:34,480
magnitude of the gradient and so what
 

1671
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,030
magnitude of the gradient and so what
this will do is that if you have a

1672
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,040
this will do is that if you have a
 

1673
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,109
this will do is that if you have a
smaller magnitude you will take a bigger

1674
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:39,119
smaller magnitude you will take a bigger
 

1675
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,630
smaller magnitude you will take a bigger
step and if you have a bigger magnitude

1676
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:40,640
step and if you have a bigger magnitude
 

1677
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,150
step and if you have a bigger magnitude
you will take a a smaller step

1678
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,160
you will take a a smaller step
 

1679
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,710
you will take a a smaller step
effectively which may or may not be

1680
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:44,720
effectively which may or may not be
 

1681
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,230
effectively which may or may not be
actually desirable for you. One of the

1682
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,240
actually desirable for you. One of the
 

1683
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,230
actually desirable for you. One of the
nice things and one of the reasons like

1684
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,240
nice things and one of the reasons like
 

1685
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,430
nice things and one of the reasons like
when you look at the proof of the

1686
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,440
when you look at the proof of the
 

1687
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,030
when you look at the proof of the
convergence of gradient descent, right?

1688
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,040
convergence of gradient descent, right?
 

1689
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,710
convergence of gradient descent, right?
One of the things that matters is the

1690
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:52,720
One of the things that matters is the
 

1691
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,190
One of the things that matters is the
fact that in a convex problem, your

1692
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
fact that in a convex problem, your
 

1693
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,550
fact that in a convex problem, your
gradient is going to zero as you're

1694
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:56,560
gradient is going to zero as you're
 

1695
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,630
gradient is going to zero as you're
getting close to your optimum. So having

1696
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:58,640
getting close to your optimum. So having
 

1697
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,030
getting close to your optimum. So having
this normalization by the magnitude of

1698
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
this normalization by the magnitude of
 

1699
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,710
this normalization by the magnitude of
the gradient may or may not actually be

1700
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:02,720
the gradient may or may not actually be
 

1701
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,150
the gradient may or may not actually be
desirable for you because if you get

1702
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,160
desirable for you because if you get
 

1703
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,150
desirable for you because if you get
close to the optimum and then your norm

1704
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,160
close to the optimum and then your norm
 

1705
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,790
close to the optimum and then your norm
is going to zero, this might not be a

1706
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:08,800
is going to zero, this might not be a
 

1707
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,670
is going to zero, this might not be a
good thing.

1708
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:11,680
good thing.
 

1709
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,510
good thing.
>> Yeah. Yes.

1710
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520

 

1711
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,470

Yes.

1712
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:22,480

 

1713
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,829

>> Okay, that's a great question. So, the

1714
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:23,839
>> Okay, that's a great question. So, the
 

1715
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,990
>> Okay, that's a great question. So, the
question is, uh, arbitrary alert, you

1716
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,000
question is, uh, arbitrary alert, you
 

1717
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,750
question is, uh, arbitrary alert, you
just chose the infinity norm out of your

1718
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:29,760
just chose the infinity norm out of your
 

1719
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,750
just chose the infinity norm out of your
pocket and then you said true norm was

00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:31,760
pocket and then you said true norm was
 

1721
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,109
pocket and then you said true norm was
your favorite, but who cares about your

00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:33,119
your favorite, but who cares about your
 

1723
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,550
your favorite, but who cares about your
favorite, you know? I want to do my

1725
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,390

favorite. Um, so agreed, right? I

1726
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,400
favorite. Um, so agreed, right? I
 

1727
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,630
favorite. Um, so agreed, right? I
haven't justified to you why we're

1728
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:40,640
haven't justified to you why we're
 

1729
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,309
haven't justified to you why we're
choosing the infinity norm and why we're

1730
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
choosing the infinity norm and why we're
 

1731
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,510
choosing the infinity norm and why we're
choosing the two norm.

1732

choosing the two norm.
 

1733
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,069
choosing the two norm.
And in some sense that's the point

1734
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:50,079
And in some sense that's the point
 

1735
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,710
And in some sense that's the point
because what we're trying to do here is

because what we're trying to do here is

because what we're trying to do here is
we're trying to give you a perspective

1738

we're trying to give you a perspective
 

1739
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,430
we're trying to give you a perspective
on optimizers. So Adam wasn't developed

1740
00:42:59,430 --> 00:42:59,440
on optimizers. So Adam wasn't developed
 

1741
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,670
on optimizers. So Adam wasn't developed
because the people who developed Adam

1742
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:01,680
because the people who developed Adam
 

1743
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,870
because the people who developed Adam
loved the infinity norm. This idea that

1744
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:04,880
loved the infinity norm. This idea that
 

1745
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,190
loved the infinity norm. This idea that
sins GD is this optimization problem

1746
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,200
sins GD is this optimization problem
 

1747
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,309
sins GD is this optimization problem
with the infinity norm came after sin GD

1748
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:12,319
with the infinity norm came after sin GD
 

1749
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,670
with the infinity norm came after sin GD
was developed in some sense.

1750
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:15,680
was developed in some sense.
 

1751
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,750
was developed in some sense.
Okay. So we're saying oh there's this

1752
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:17,760
Okay. So we're saying oh there's this
 

1753
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,910
Okay. So we're saying oh there's this
atom. Oh look at Adam is amazing. It

1754
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:19,920
atom. Oh look at Adam is amazing. It
 

1755
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,710
atom. Oh look at Adam is amazing. It
works great. And what we're saying is if

1756
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:22,720
works great. And what we're saying is if
 

1757
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,470
works great. And what we're saying is if
you think about Adam from this

1758
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:24,480
you think about Adam from this
 

1759
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,230
you think about Adam from this
perspective and you look at it as from

1760
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,240
perspective and you look at it as from
 

1761
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,030
perspective and you look at it as from
this particular optimization problem and

1762
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,040
this particular optimization problem and
 

1763
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,230
this particular optimization problem and
you choose the infinity infinity norm

1764
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240
you choose the infinity infinity norm
 

1765
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,910
you choose the infinity infinity norm
then

1766
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:33,920
then
 

1767
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,230
then
sin SGD or the you know the brother

1768
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,240
sin SGD or the you know the brother
 

1769
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,109
sin SGD or the you know the brother
sister of Adam pops out

1770
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:43,119

 

1771
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,349

then the same thing for two norm well

1772
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:45,359
then the same thing for two norm well
 

1773
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,430
then the same thing for two norm well
two gradient descent we kind of already

1774
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:47,440
two gradient descent we kind of already
 

1775
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,790
two gradient descent we kind of already
knew this like the community already

1776
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:48,800
knew this like the community already
 

1777
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,510
knew this like the community already
knew this that's not

1778
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:51,520
knew this that's not
 

1779
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,510
knew this that's not
But what this is what this question is

1780
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
But what this is what this question is
 

1781
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,950
But what this is what this question is
saying well so then obviously you know

1782
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:56,960
saying well so then obviously you know
 

1783
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,670
saying well so then obviously you know
there's nothing special about the

1784
00:43:59,670 --> 00:43:59,680
there's nothing special about the
 

1785
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,470
there's nothing special about the
infinity norm why aren't we trying all

1786
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:02,480
infinity norm why aren't we trying all
 

1787
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,710
infinity norm why aren't we trying all
the different norms here now we have

1788
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
the different norms here now we have
 

1789
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,230
the different norms here now we have
we're basically generating a recipe for

1790
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,240
we're basically generating a recipe for
 

1791
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,470
we're basically generating a recipe for
creating optimizers right we're saying

1792
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:12,480
creating optimizers right we're saying
 

1793
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,630
creating optimizers right we're saying
let's take a norm let's take a step size

1794
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:16,640
let's take a norm let's take a step size
 

1795
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,910
let's take a norm let's take a step size
let's turn the crank on this

1796
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:17,920
let's turn the crank on this
 

1797
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,230
let's turn the crank on this
optimization problem.

1798
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:20,240
optimization problem.
 

1799
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,230
optimization problem.
Optimizer one, optimizer two, optimizer

1800
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:22,240
Optimizer one, optimizer two, optimizer
 

1801
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,510
Optimizer one, optimizer two, optimizer
three, optimizer four. You can just

1802
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:23,520
three, optimizer four. You can just
 

1803
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,190
three, optimizer four. You can just
start printing them, right? And that's

1804
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:27,200
start printing them, right? And that's
 

1805
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,069
start printing them, right? And that's
exactly what we want to ideally try and

1806
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:30,079
exactly what we want to ideally try and
 

1807
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,950
exactly what we want to ideally try and
do. Okay? Now, there are two challenges

1808
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,960
do. Okay? Now, there are two challenges
 

1809
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,589
do. Okay? Now, there are two challenges
in turning the crank on this recipe.

1810
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:35,599
in turning the crank on this recipe.
 

1811
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,190
in turning the crank on this recipe.
First is that

1812
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:39,200
First is that
 

1813
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,270
First is that
we need to look at this optimization

1814
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:41,280
we need to look at this optimization
 

1815
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,829
we need to look at this optimization
problem and we need to say which norms

1816
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:43,839
problem and we need to say which norms
 

1817
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,990
problem and we need to say which norms
make sense.

1818
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,000
make sense.
 

1819
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,990
make sense.
Okay, some norms might be better than

1820
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:48,000
Okay, some norms might be better than
 

1821
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,109
Okay, some norms might be better than
others and maybe we want to have a way

1822
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:51,119
others and maybe we want to have a way
 

1823
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,430
others and maybe we want to have a way
of thinking about which norms we like

1824
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,440
of thinking about which norms we like
 

1825
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,190
of thinking about which norms we like
and which norms we don't like.

1826
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:57,200
and which norms we don't like.
 

1827
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,950
and which norms we don't like.
Now, there's one way of finding which

1828
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:58,960
Now, there's one way of finding which
 

1829
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,109
Now, there's one way of finding which
norms we like.

1830
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:01,119
norms we like.
 

1831
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,630
norms we like.
And what is that way of finding which

1832
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:02,640
And what is that way of finding which
 

1833
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,870
And what is that way of finding which
norms we like?

1834
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:04,880
norms we like?
 

1835
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,349
norms we like?
Yeah,

1836
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:05,359
Yeah,
 

1837
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,550
Yeah,
>> empirical testing.

1838
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:06,560
>> empirical testing.
 

1839
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,390
>> empirical testing.
>> Empirical testing is one great way of

1840
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:08,400
>> Empirical testing is one great way of
 

1841
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,990
>> Empirical testing is one great way of
doing it. What's another way?

1842
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:12,000
doing it. What's another way?
 

1843
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,510
doing it. What's another way?
You use the norms that are tractable,

1844
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:13,520
You use the norms that are tractable,
 

1845
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,349
You use the norms that are tractable,
right? the things that are easy to do

1846
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:15,359
right? the things that are easy to do
 

1847
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,430
right? the things that are easy to do
math with and the ones that are easy to

1848
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440
math with and the ones that are easy to
 

1849
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,349
math with and the ones that are easy to
understand, you start with those because

1850
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:19,359
understand, you start with those because
 

1851
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,030
understand, you start with those because
that helps you understand and interpret

1852
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,040
that helps you understand and interpret
 

1853
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,910
that helps you understand and interpret
things. Okay? So there's the empirical

1854
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:23,920
things. Okay? So there's the empirical
 

1855
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,069
things. Okay? So there's the empirical
testing and there is the like how do you

1856
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:28,079
testing and there is the like how do you
 

1857
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,230
testing and there is the like how do you
want to how do you want to choose the

1858
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:30,240
want to how do you want to choose the
 

1859
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,510
want to how do you want to choose the
norm? And so what we want to try and do

1860
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:33,520
norm? And so what we want to try and do
 

1861
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,270
norm? And so what we want to try and do
and that's exactly what we're going to

1862
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280
and that's exactly what we're going to
 

1863
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,630
and that's exactly what we're going to
try and do for now this lecture and

1864
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:38,640
try and do for now this lecture and
 

1865
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,030
try and do for now this lecture and
moving and that'll set up basically for

1866
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:41,040
moving and that'll set up basically for
 

1867
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,030
moving and that'll set up basically for
the next lecture

1868
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,040
the next lecture
 

1869
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,270
the next lecture
is see what we can do with this recipe

1870
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:45,280
is see what we can do with this recipe
 

1871
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,309
is see what we can do with this recipe
or why uh does that does that answer the

1872
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:48,319
or why uh does that does that answer the
 

1873
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:48,870
or why uh does that does that answer the
question?

1874
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:48,880
question?
 

1875
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,990
question?
>> Yeah.

1876
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,000
>> Yeah.
 

1877
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,030
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. Um I understand how like we switch

1878
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:55,040
>> Yeah. Um I understand how like we switch
 

1879
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,829
>> Yeah. Um I understand how like we switch
from an argument on like the delta data

1880
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:57,839
from an argument on like the delta data
 

1881
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,950
from an argument on like the delta data
to an argument later on like data itself

1882
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:00,960
to an argument later on like data itself
 

1883
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,470
to an argument later on like data itself
and I understand how they're kind of

1884
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,480
and I understand how they're kind of
 

1885
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,589
and I understand how they're kind of
achieve the same point with the

1886
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:03,599
achieve the same point with the
 

1887
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,790
achieve the same point with the
regularization limiting like how big the

1888
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:06,800
regularization limiting like how big the
 

1889
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,670
regularization limiting like how big the
data really but are those like the same

1890
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:09,680
data really but are those like the same
 

1891
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,990
data really but are those like the same
problem or are those just kind of like

1892
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:12,000
problem or are those just kind of like
 

1893
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,109
problem or are those just kind of like
similar

1894
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:13,119

00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:25,680
perspective here when I have interpreted
 

1905
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,870
perspective here when I have interpreted
this as a regularizer right or a lrange

1906
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
this as a regularizer right or a lrange
 

1907
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,190
this as a regularizer right or a lrange
multiplier um and uh two things one for

1908
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,200
multiplier um and uh two things one for
 

1909
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,430
multiplier um and uh two things one for
example you can provably show that for

1910
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:35,440
example you can provably show that for
 

1911
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,990
example you can provably show that for
the two norm the set the solutions that

1912
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:38,000
the two norm the set the solutions that
 

1913
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,710
the two norm the set the solutions that
are possible in this and this as you

1914
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:40,720
are possible in this and this as you
 

1915
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,630
are possible in this and this as you
sweep ada and lambda you can choose

1916
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,640
sweep ada and lambda you can choose
 

1917
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,069
sweep ada and lambda you can choose
parameterizations that will basically

1918
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:44,079
parameterizations that will basically
 

1919
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,750
parameterizations that will basically
get you all of the same solutions.

1920
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:47,760
get you all of the same solutions.
 

1921
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,430
get you all of the same solutions.
Second,

1922
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,440
Second,
 

1923
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,030
Second,
again remember we're we're doing

1924
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,040
again remember we're we're doing
 

1925
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,790
again remember we're we're doing
deep learning or even just even if you

1926
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:54,800
deep learning or even just even if you
 

1927
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,790
deep learning or even just even if you
just think about optimization.

1928
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:56,800
just think about optimization.
 

1929
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,950
just think about optimization.
Optimization

1930
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:58,960
Optimization
 

1931
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,230
Optimization
is about finding a solution that works.

1932
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,240
is about finding a solution that works.
 

1933
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,630
is about finding a solution that works.
You've taken some real world problem and

1934
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:04,640
You've taken some real world problem and
 

1935
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,030
You've taken some real world problem and
you've mathematized it into these set of

1936
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:07,040
you've mathematized it into these set of
 

1937
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,990
you've mathematized it into these set of
equations and these equations are trying

1938
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,000
equations and these equations are trying
 

1939
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,710
equations and these equations are trying
to reflect your understanding of the

1940
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:12,720
to reflect your understanding of the
 

1941
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,270
to reflect your understanding of the
real world. Okay, this is not set in

1942
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,280
real world. Okay, this is not set in
 

1943
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,790
real world. Okay, this is not set in
stone.

1944
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:16,800
stone.
 

1945
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,270
stone.
So now if I wanted to say I don't want

1946
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:19,280
So now if I wanted to say I don't want
 

1947
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,270
So now if I wanted to say I don't want
my step to be too big, there are

1948
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:21,280
my step to be too big, there are
 

1949
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,550
my step to be too big, there are
multiple different ways I can

1950
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:22,560
multiple different ways I can
 

1951
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,829
multiple different ways I can
mathematically write this and it is okay

1952
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:25,839
mathematically write this and it is okay
 

1953
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,910
mathematically write this and it is okay
for me to choose the way of

1954
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:27,920
for me to choose the way of
 

1955
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,670
for me to choose the way of
mathematically writing it that is

1956
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:29,680
mathematically writing it that is
 

1957
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,750
mathematically writing it that is
convenient to me or that I like or that

1958
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:31,760
convenient to me or that I like or that
 

1959
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,349
convenient to me or that I like or that
gives me the answer that is convenient

1960
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
gives me the answer that is convenient
 

1961
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,630
gives me the answer that is convenient
to implement or convenient to solve

1962
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:36,640
to implement or convenient to solve
 

1963
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,630
to implement or convenient to solve
because at the end of the day we're just

1964
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:38,640
because at the end of the day we're just
 

1965
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,030
because at the end of the day we're just
modeling. We're modeling and trying to

1966
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:41,040
modeling. We're modeling and trying to
 

1967
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,230
modeling. We're modeling and trying to
do something that works in the real

1968
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:42,240
do something that works in the real
 

1969
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,470
do something that works in the real
world. If it works, it works. Like this

1970
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:44,480
world. If it works, it works. Like this
 

1971
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,710
world. If it works, it works. Like this
is the uh you know look where the light

1972
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,720
is the uh you know look where the light
 

1973
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,470
is the uh you know look where the light
is kind of analogy like if you can make

1974
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:48,480
is kind of analogy like if you can make
 

1975
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,990
is kind of analogy like if you can make
it work that's great. So there's an

1976
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,000
it work that's great. So there's an
 

1977
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,309
it work that's great. So there's an
element of that here. We're not you know

1978
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:52,319
element of that here. We're not you know
 

1979
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,990
element of that here. We're not you know
it's not like oh this particular

1980
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:54,000
it's not like oh this particular
 

1981
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,630
it's not like oh this particular
optimization came from the skies and we

1982
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:56,640
optimization came from the skies and we
 

1983
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,390
optimization came from the skies and we
care about this optimization problem. No

1984
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,400
care about this optimization problem. No
 

1985
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,430
care about this optimization problem. No
we formulated it. We were the engineers.

1986
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:01,440
we formulated it. We were the engineers.
 

1987
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,670
we formulated it. We were the engineers.
Make sense?

1988
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680

 

1989
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,069

Okay. So I'll move on.

1990
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:10,079
Okay. So I'll move on.
 

1991
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,829
Okay. So I'll move on.
So now building on the question that was

1992
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:11,839
So now building on the question that was
 

1993
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,430
So now building on the question that was
over here of like what's so special

1994
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:13,440
over here of like what's so special
 

1995
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,069
over here of like what's so special
about infinity norm is there another

1996
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:16,079
about infinity norm is there another
 

1997
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,109
about infinity norm is there another
norm that we can think about and turns

1998
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:19,119
norm that we can think about and turns
 

1999
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,950
norm that we can think about and turns
out that yes of course and that's

2000
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:20,960
out that yes of course and that's
 

2001
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,549
out that yes of course and that's
exactly what I want to get to in the

2002
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:22,559
exactly what I want to get to in the
 

2003
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,390
exactly what I want to get to in the
rest of this lecture.

2004
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:26,400

 

2005
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,990

So one thing that we've been doing is

2006
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:28,000
So one thing that we've been doing is
 

2007
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,710
So one thing that we've been doing is
we've been thinking about here we think

2008
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
we've been thinking about here we think
 

2009
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,390
we've been thinking about here we think
about these theta as our parameters and

2010
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:34,400
about these theta as our parameters and
 

2011
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,710
about these theta as our parameters and
we're thinking about them as vectors.

2012
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:36,720
we're thinking about them as vectors.
 

2013
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,670
we're thinking about them as vectors.
Okay,

2014
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:39,680
Okay,
 

2015
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,030
Okay,
but reality is that neural networks and

2016
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:43,040
but reality is that neural networks and
 

2017
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,670
but reality is that neural networks and
these parameters of neural networks are

2018
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:45,680
these parameters of neural networks are
 

2019
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,150
these parameters of neural networks are
not just one big theta vector, right?

2020
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:48,160
not just one big theta vector, right?
 

2021
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,670
not just one big theta vector, right?
Actually, what we have is we have the

2022
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:49,680
Actually, what we have is we have the
 

2023
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,109
Actually, what we have is we have the
weights and we have the biases. And so

2024
00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:53,119
weights and we have the biases. And so
 

2025
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:56,309
weights and we have the biases. And so
there's a structure to this theta.

2026
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
there's a structure to this theta.
 

2027
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,710
there's a structure to this theta.
But when we think about gradient descent

2028
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:58,720
But when we think about gradient descent
 

2029
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,790
But when we think about gradient descent
as just a gradient update to the

2030
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:00,800
as just a gradient update to the
 

2031
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,910
as just a gradient update to the
parameters, we're ignoring or turning a

2032
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:03,920
parameters, we're ignoring or turning a
 

2033
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,230
parameters, we're ignoring or turning a
blind eye to the fact that there is this

2034
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:06,240
blind eye to the fact that there is this
 

2035
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,990
blind eye to the fact that there is this
structure, this geometry, this

2036
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,000
structure, this geometry, this
 

2037
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,750
structure, this geometry, this
organization to the problem. Okay? And

2038
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:11,760
organization to the problem. Okay? And
 

2039
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,710
organization to the problem. Okay? And
so if our optimization algorithms are

2040
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:14,720
so if our optimization algorithms are
 

2041
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,030
so if our optimization algorithms are
not doing enough for us, maybe there's a

2042
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:17,040
not doing enough for us, maybe there's a
 

2043
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,710
not doing enough for us, maybe there's a
value in trying to look in a finer sense

2044
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:20,720
value in trying to look in a finer sense
 

2045
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,829
value in trying to look in a finer sense
and use the structure that we know is

2046
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:23,839
and use the structure that we know is
 

2047
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,190
and use the structure that we know is
naturally present in the problem, right?

2048
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:25,200
naturally present in the problem, right?
 

2049
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,710
naturally present in the problem, right?
But we're not even putting it in in some

2050
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:26,720
But we're not even putting it in in some
 

2051
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,829
But we're not even putting it in in some
arbitrary way. If I think about a neural

2052
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:29,839
arbitrary way. If I think about a neural
 

2053
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,670
arbitrary way. If I think about a neural
network,

2054
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:31,680
network,
 

2055
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,190
network,
I can write it this way, right? I mean,

2056
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:33,200
I can write it this way, right? I mean,
 

2057
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,710
I can write it this way, right? I mean,
I have ReLU's here, but this is just

2058
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:34,720
I have ReLU's here, but this is just
 

2059
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,950
I have ReLU's here, but this is just
think of this as just some nonlinearity,

2060
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:36,960
think of this as just some nonlinearity,
 

2061
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,349
think of this as just some nonlinearity,
which is I have my input X and then I

2062
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:39,359
which is I have my input X and then I
 

2063
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,829
which is I have my input X and then I
have my weight times my input plus my

2064
00:49:41,829 --> 00:49:41,839
have my weight times my input plus my
 

2065
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,630
have my weight times my input plus my
bias. I take some nonlinearity. I

2066
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:44,640
bias. I take some nonlinearity. I
 

2067
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,109
bias. I take some nonlinearity. I
compute my network this way. And here I

2068
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,119
compute my network this way. And here I
 

2069
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,430
compute my network this way. And here I
naturally have this matrix. Okay,

2070
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:51,440
naturally have this matrix. Okay,
 

2071
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,670
naturally have this matrix. Okay,
so maybe there's some value in thinking

2072
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:53,680
so maybe there's some value in thinking
 

2073
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,510
so maybe there's some value in thinking
about our parameters in matrix form

2074
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:57,520
about our parameters in matrix form
 

2075
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,910
about our parameters in matrix form
themselves. And if you remember what we

2076
00:49:59,910 --> 00:49:59,920
themselves. And if you remember what we
 

2077
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,750
themselves. And if you remember what we
talked about in the uh kind of

2078
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:01,760
talked about in the uh kind of
 

2079
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,790
talked about in the uh kind of
initialization lecture was, you know,

2080
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:04,800
initialization lecture was, you know,
 

2081
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,710
initialization lecture was, you know,
the weight matrices are in some sense a

2082
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:08,720
the weight matrices are in some sense a
 

2083
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,950
the weight matrices are in some sense a
a they have a they have a behavior and

2084
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:10,960
a they have a they have a behavior and
 

2085
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,270
a they have a they have a behavior and
the fact that these are multiplying

2086
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,280
the fact that these are multiplying
 

2087
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,750
the fact that these are multiplying
matters and so these are the things that

2088
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:15,760
matters and so these are the things that
 

2089
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,950
matters and so these are the things that
can cause u scaling problems.

2090
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:18,960
can cause u scaling problems.
 

2091
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,430
can cause u scaling problems.
So one perspective is like let's just

2092
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:21,440
So one perspective is like let's just
 

2093
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,230
So one perspective is like let's just
focus on how we do updates of the weight

2094
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:24,240
focus on how we do updates of the weight
 

2095
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,910
focus on how we do updates of the weight
matrices. Let's put the problem of the

2096
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:25,920
matrices. Let's put the problem of the
 

2097
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,190
matrices. Let's put the problem of the
bias uh updates aside for just a moment.

2098
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,200
bias uh updates aside for just a moment.
 

2099
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,750
bias uh updates aside for just a moment.
Okay, let's focus on the updates of the

2100
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760
Okay, let's focus on the updates of the
 

2101
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,829
Okay, let's focus on the updates of the
weight matrices.

2102
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:35,839

 

2103
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,950

So here what I have

2104
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:38,960
So here what I have
 

2105
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,829
So here what I have
is if I take now

2106
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:41,839
is if I take now
 

2107
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,790
is if I take now
this optimization problem that I've been

2108
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:44,800
this optimization problem that I've been
 

2109
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,870
this optimization problem that I've been
thinking about the same optimization

2110
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:46,880
thinking about the same optimization
 

2111
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,430
thinking about the same optimization
problem that I was thinking about when I

2112
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:49,440
problem that I was thinking about when I
 

2113
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,270
problem that I was thinking about when I
did the sin SGD and the gradient descent

2114
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:53,280
did the sin SGD and the gradient descent
 

2115
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,150
did the sin SGD and the gradient descent
but instead of taking the gradient with

2116
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:56,160
but instead of taking the gradient with
 

2117
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,710
but instead of taking the gradient with
respect to this theta vector I think

2118
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:58,720
respect to this theta vector I think
 

2119
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,510
respect to this theta vector I think
about my weight matrices as the

2120
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:01,520
about my weight matrices as the
 

2121
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,510
about my weight matrices as the
parameters that I'm trying to update.

2122
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
parameters that I'm trying to update.
 

2123
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,549
parameters that I'm trying to update.
Okay. So now I think of this as in as an

2124
00:51:06,549 --> 00:51:06,559
Okay. So now I think of this as in as an
 

2125
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,950
Okay. So now I think of this as in as an
inner product between two matrices.

2126
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:10,960
inner product between two matrices.
 

2127
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,950
inner product between two matrices.
Okay. This delta w is a matrix.

2128
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:14,960
Okay. This delta w is a matrix.
 

2129
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,870
Okay. This delta w is a matrix.
It's how my parameters are changing with

2130
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:16,880
It's how my parameters are changing with
 

2131
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,750
It's how my parameters are changing with
every gradient step. And here I write

2132
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:19,760
every gradient step. And here I write
 

2133
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,150
every gradient step. And here I write
this gradient of the loss with respect

2134
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,160
this gradient of the loss with respect
 

2135
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,910
this gradient of the loss with respect
to that matrix w.

2136
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:25,920
to that matrix w.
 

2137
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,910
to that matrix w.
And again I'm saying I don't want my

2138
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:27,920
And again I'm saying I don't want my
 

2139
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,670
And again I'm saying I don't want my
step to be too small. So I'm saying my

2140
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:29,680
step to be too small. So I'm saying my
 

2141
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,150
step to be too small. So I'm saying my
delta w instead of my delta theta is

2142
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:32,160
delta w instead of my delta theta is
 

2143
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,190
delta w instead of my delta theta is
less than or equal to ada. I'm just

2144
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:35,200
less than or equal to ada. I'm just
 

2145
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,309
less than or equal to ada. I'm just
writing the same optimization problem

2146
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:38,319
writing the same optimization problem
 

2147
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,470
writing the same optimization problem
with w instead of theta and thinking of

2148
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:40,480
with w instead of theta and thinking of
 

2149
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,630
with w instead of theta and thinking of
it as a matrix instead of a vector

2150
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:42,640
it as a matrix instead of a vector
 

2151
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,030
it as a matrix instead of a vector
because that's the natural structure of

2152
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
because that's the natural structure of
 

2153
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,950
because that's the natural structure of
the problem. Everyone with me there?

2154
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:48,960
the problem. Everyone with me there?
 

2155
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,270
the problem. Everyone with me there?
Okay. So let's just remember what this

2156
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:51,280
Okay. So let's just remember what this
 

2157
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,510
Okay. So let's just remember what this
inner product means now in this sense.

2158
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:55,520
inner product means now in this sense.
 

2159
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,950
inner product means now in this sense.
Well,

2160
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:58,960

 

2161
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,349

I have that the inner product for

2162
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:01,359
I have that the inner product for
 

2163
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:05,589
I have that the inner product for
matrices is just given by the trace of

2164
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:05,599
matrices is just given by the trace of
 

2165
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,670
matrices is just given by the trace of
arpose time b. Okay.

2166
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:09,680
arpose time b. Okay.
 

2167
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,270
arpose time b. Okay.
Just reminding ourselves of what this

2168
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,280
Just reminding ourselves of what this
 

2169
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,190
Just reminding ourselves of what this
means.

2170
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:13,200
means.
 

2171
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,390
means.
And now I again come to the question of

2172
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:16,400
And now I again come to the question of
 

2173
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,390
And now I again come to the question of
if I want to solve an optimization

2174
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
if I want to solve an optimization
 

2175
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,630
if I want to solve an optimization
problem of this form,

2176
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:20,640
problem of this form,
 

2177
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,309
problem of this form,
I want to be able to choose an

2178
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:22,319
I want to be able to choose an
 

2179
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,870
I want to be able to choose an
appropriate norm here.

2180
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:24,880
appropriate norm here.
 

2181
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,349
appropriate norm here.
And the question becomes again well what

2182
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:27,359
And the question becomes again well what
 

2183
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:31,270
And the question becomes again well what
norm do I want to choose? Okay. And so

2184
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:31,280
norm do I want to choose? Okay. And so
 

2185
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,069
norm do I want to choose? Okay. And so
what is a natural norm to choose when we

2186
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:34,079
what is a natural norm to choose when we
 

2187
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,549
what is a natural norm to choose when we
think about matrices?

2188
00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:38,559

 

2189
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,870

There's basically if you look at 127

2190
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:40,880
There's basically if you look at 127
 

2191
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,549
There's basically if you look at 127
there's two norms that you learned about

2192
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:44,559
there's two norms that you learned about
 

2193
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,390
there's two norms that you learned about
here. We're thinking about how this this

2194
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:46,400
here. We're thinking about how this this
 

2195
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,309
here. We're thinking about how this this
matrix is basically thinking is take

2196
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:48,319
matrix is basically thinking is take
 

2197
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:49,910
matrix is basically thinking is take
it's taking these hidden layers or it's

2198
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:49,920
it's taking these hidden layers or it's
 

2199
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,750
it's taking these hidden layers or it's
taking these x vectors and it's scaling

2200
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:51,760
taking these x vectors and it's scaling
 

2201
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,630
taking these x vectors and it's scaling
them. Right? So there's the spectral

2202
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:54,640
them. Right? So there's the spectral
 

2203
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,549
them. Right? So there's the spectral
norm and there's the probinius norm. The

2204
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:56,559
norm and there's the probinius norm. The
 

2205
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,069
norm and there's the probinius norm. The
spectral norm is the one that talks

2206
00:52:58,069 --> 00:52:58,079
spectral norm is the one that talks
 

2207
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,349
spectral norm is the one that talks
about how vectors get scaled. So maybe

2208
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:01,359
about how vectors get scaled. So maybe
 

2209
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,829
about how vectors get scaled. So maybe
it's a natural choice to think about the

2210
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:03,839
it's a natural choice to think about the
 

2211
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,549
it's a natural choice to think about the
spectral norm of the particular matrix.

2212
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:06,559
spectral norm of the particular matrix.
 

2213
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,710
spectral norm of the particular matrix.
Okay, we could make other choices. We

2214
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,720
Okay, we could make other choices. We
 

2215
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,309
Okay, we could make other choices. We
are make we happen to be making this one

2216
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:10,319
are make we happen to be making this one
 

2217
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,670
are make we happen to be making this one
because it gives us interesting results.

2218
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:13,680
because it gives us interesting results.
 

2219
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,589
because it gives us interesting results.
Everyone good with me? Questions?

2220
00:53:17,589 --> 00:53:17,599
Everyone good with me? Questions?
 

2221
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:22,230
Everyone good with me? Questions?
Okay.

2222
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:22,240

 

2223
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,990

So let me just remind you of what the

2224
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,000
So let me just remind you of what the
 

2225
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,309
So let me just remind you of what the
spectral norm is. It's just this maximum

2226
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:26,319
spectral norm is. It's just this maximum
 

2227
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,390
spectral norm is. It's just this maximum
singular value. Or another way of

2228
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:28,400
singular value. Or another way of
 

2229
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,829
singular value. Or another way of
thinking about it is when I have a unit

2230
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:31,839
thinking about it is when I have a unit
 

2231
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,150
thinking about it is when I have a unit
norm vector,

2232
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,160
norm vector,
 

2233
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,030
norm vector,
what is the worst that this matrix can

2234
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:37,040
what is the worst that this matrix can
 

2235
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,790
what is the worst that this matrix can
do to it? How much can it scale that

2236
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:38,800
do to it? How much can it scale that
 

2237
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,030
do to it? How much can it scale that
vector by? Well, that is given by the

2238
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:41,040
vector by? Well, that is given by the
 

2239
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,790
vector by? Well, that is given by the
largest singular value or the spectral

2240
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:42,800
largest singular value or the spectral
 

2241
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,870
largest singular value or the spectral
norm.

2242
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:44,880
norm.
 

2243
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,910
norm.
Just put pulling these u memories of

2244
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:47,920
Just put pulling these u memories of
 

2245
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,589
Just put pulling these u memories of
what the spectral norm means back into

2246
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:49,599
what the spectral norm means back into
 

2247
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,510
what the spectral norm means back into
your cache.

2248
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:53,520

Okay. So with this what I want to do now

2252
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:58,880
Okay. So with this what I want to do now
 

2253
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,750
Okay. So with this what I want to do now
is I want to consider this optimization

2261
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,630

and here I have this inner product of

2262
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:14,640
and here I have this inner product of
 

2263
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,710
and here I have this inner product of
matrices.

2264
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:20,720

 

2265
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,750

Everyone with me here?

How to solve this optimization problem
 

2273
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,349
How to solve this optimization problem
is a separate issue which we will come

2274
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:33,359
is a separate issue which we will come
 

2275
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,270
is a separate issue which we will come
to. Why this is an interesting

2276
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:35,280
to. Why this is an interesting
 

2277
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,870

optimization problem? We will also come
 

2279
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,030
optimization problem? We will also come
to but what am I trying to do? I'm

2280
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,040
to but what am I trying to do? I'm
 

2281
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,950
to but what am I trying to do? I'm
building off of this question is what is

2282
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:40,960
building off of this question is what is
 

2283
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,510
building off of this question is what is
so special about the infinity norm. The

2284
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:43,520
so special about the infinity norm. The
 

2285
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,950
so special about the infinity norm. The
answer is there is nothing special about

2286
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:44,960
answer is there is nothing special about
 

2287
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,829
answer is there is nothing special about
it. we can choose a different norm and

2288
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:47,839
it. we can choose a different norm and
 

2289
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,190
it. we can choose a different norm and
in fact let us try to take a perspective

2290
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,200
in fact let us try to take a perspective
 

2291
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,790
in fact let us try to take a perspective
that brings in the structure of the

2292
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:52,800
that brings in the structure of the
 

2293
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,950
that brings in the structure of the
problem naturally the natural structure

2294
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:54,960
problem naturally the natural structure
 

2295
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,630

okay I feel like I should take questions

2308
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:20,400

 

2309

2315
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,910

Okay, I see some thumbs downs. So,

2316
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:29,920
Okay, I see some thumbs downs. So,
 

2317
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,109
Okay, I see some thumbs downs. So,
someone asked me a question.

2318
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:35,119

 

2319
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:41,349

>> Yeah.

2320
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:41,359

 

2321
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,670

Uh yes, this should be a two norm here.

2322
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:43,680
Uh yes, this should be a two norm here.
 

2323
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:51,430
Uh yes, this should be a two norm here.
Thank you.

uh try different norms. and try

uh try different norms. and try
 

2345
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:25,270

different prop like ways of looking at
 

2347
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,470
different prop like ways of looking at

2348
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:28,480
the problem. Uh we're not we're saying
 

2349
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,349
the problem. Uh we're not we're saying
that within this norm ball. So we're

2350
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:31,359
that within this norm ball. So we're
 

2351
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,150
that within this norm ball. So we're
kind of we're fixing the step size but

2352
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:34,160
kind of we're fixing the step size but
 

2353
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,270
kind of we're fixing the step size but
we're fixing the step size

2354
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:37,280
we're fixing the step size
 

2355
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,150
we're fixing the step size
in a particular geometry. Right? So

2356
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:40,160
in a particular geometry. Right? So
 

2357
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,150
in a particular geometry. Right? So
we're saying that the the choice of the

2358
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160
we're saying that the the choice of the
 

2359
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,710
we're saying that the the choice of the
norm is essentially fixing the notion of

2360
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:44,720
norm is essentially fixing the notion of
 

2361
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,950
norm is essentially fixing the notion of
distance or but we're saying within this

2362
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:48,960
distance or but we're saying within this
 

2363
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,870
distance or but we're saying within this
distance what is the direction that I

2364
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:50,880
distance what is the direction that I
 

2365
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,109
distance what is the direction that I
should move in?

2366
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:55,119

 

2367
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,870

Okay,

2368
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:56,880
Okay,
 

2369
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:03,510
Okay,
good.

2370
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:03,520

 

2371
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,750

So how should we actually solve this?

2372
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:05,760
So how should we actually solve this?
 

2373
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,349
So how should we actually solve this?
We're going to get to that. What I want

2374
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:07,359
We're going to get to that. What I want
 

2375
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,150
We're going to get to that. What I want
to tell you is that if you were able to

2376
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:10,160
to tell you is that if you were able to
 

2377
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,030
to tell you is that if you were able to
solve this, it turns out that Giz gives

2378
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,040
solve this, it turns out that Giz gives
 

2379
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,870
solve this, it turns out that Giz gives
you a variant of uh what is known as the

2380
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:16,880
you a variant of uh what is known as the
 

2381
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,510
you a variant of uh what is known as the
shampoo optimizer. I actually do not

2382
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:19,520
shampoo optimizer. I actually do not
 

2383
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,030
shampoo optimizer. I actually do not
know why it was called that. I meant to

2384
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:21,040
know why it was called that. I meant to
 

2385
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,630
know why it was called that. I meant to
look it up before the lecture and I

2386
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:22,640
look it up before the lecture and I
 

2387
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,109
look it up before the lecture and I
forgot. Um but it's called shampoo.

2388
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:27,119
forgot. Um but it's called shampoo.
 

2389
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,109
forgot. Um but it's called shampoo.
There's also another variant of shampoo

2390
00:57:29,109 --> 00:57:29,119
There's also another variant of shampoo
 

2391
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,950
There's also another variant of shampoo
that is called soap.

2392
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:32,960

 

2393
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,950

Um but you know I guess people are

2394
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:34,960
Um but you know I guess people are
 

2395
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,910
Um but you know I guess people are
having fun with uh with with naming

2396
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:37,920
having fun with uh with with naming
 

2397
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,789
having fun with uh with with naming
convention uh naming conventions

2398
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:40,799
convention uh naming conventions
 

2399
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,870
convention uh naming conventions
but shampoo was actually proposed in

2400
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:42,880
but shampoo was actually proposed in
 

2401
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,589
but shampoo was actually proposed in
like 2017 2018. Shampoo again was not

2402
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
like 2017 2018. Shampoo again was not
 

2403
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,430
like 2017 2018. Shampoo again was not
proposed by thinking of this

2404
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:49,440
proposed by thinking of this
 

2405
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,109
proposed by thinking of this
optimization problem and then asking the

2406
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:51,119
optimization problem and then asking the
 

2407
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,510
optimization problem and then asking the
very nice question of what is so special

2408
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:53,520
very nice question of what is so special
 

2409
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,390
very nice question of what is so special
about the infinity norm.

2410
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:56,400
about the infinity norm.
 

2411
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,870
about the infinity norm.
there was a series of you know other

2412
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:58,880
there was a series of you know other
 

2413
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,309
there was a series of you know other
considerations about geometry and just

2414
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:02,319
considerations about geometry and just
 

2415
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,069
considerations about geometry and just
trying to get more perspective out of

2416
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:04,079
trying to get more perspective out of
 

2417
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,710
trying to get more perspective out of
this um that led to the proposal of

2418
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:06,720
this um that led to the proposal of
 

2419
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,710
this um that led to the proposal of
shampoo then there was another

2420
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:08,720
shampoo then there was another
 

2421
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,950
shampoo then there was another
interpretation of shampoo as more like a

2422
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:10,960
interpretation of shampoo as more like a
 

2423
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,270
interpretation of shampoo as more like a
second order method with like you know

2424
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:13,280
second order method with like you know
 

2425
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,670
second order method with like you know
kind of like Newton's method is a second

2426
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:15,680
kind of like Newton's method is a second
 

2427
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,430
kind of like Newton's method is a second
order method thinking of maybe shamp

2428
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:17,440
order method thinking of maybe shamp
 

2429
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,670
order method thinking of maybe shamp
thinking of shampoo in that light and

2430
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:19,680
thinking of shampoo in that light and
 

2431
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,630
thinking of shampoo in that light and
then this perspective on shampoo is very

2432
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:22,640
then this perspective on shampoo is very
 

2433
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,390
then this perspective on shampoo is very
very recent okay so again it's not that

2434
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:26,400
very recent okay so again it's not that
 

2435
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,630
very recent okay so again it's not that
we ran this recipe and out popped Adam

2436
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:28,640
we ran this recipe and out popped Adam
 

2437
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,390
we ran this recipe and out popped Adam
out pout shampoo. This was not a turn

2438
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:30,400
out pout shampoo. This was not a turn
 

2439
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,549
out pout shampoo. This was not a turn
the crank but shampoo was developed

2440
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:32,559
the crank but shampoo was developed
 

2441
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,710
the crank but shampoo was developed
independently. This perspective is

2442
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:34,720
independently. This perspective is
 

2443
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,870
independently. This perspective is
coming later.

2444
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:38,880

 

2445
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,710

And turns out that this other variant of

2446
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:40,720
And turns out that this other variant of
 

2447
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,270
And turns out that this other variant of
shampoo, you know, did very well in one

2448
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:43,280
shampoo, you know, did very well in one
 

2449
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,950
shampoo, you know, did very well in one
of these uh training algorithm

2450
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:44,960
of these uh training algorithm
 

2451
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,789
of these uh training algorithm
competitions. So that also ended up

2452
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:46,799
competitions. So that also ended up
 

2453
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,309
competitions. So that also ended up
getting it a bunch of uh a bunch of

2454
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:48,319
getting it a bunch of uh a bunch of
 

2455
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,430
getting it a bunch of uh a bunch of
attention. Okay. So now I want to focus

2456
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:51,440
attention. Okay. So now I want to focus
 

2457
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,470
attention. Okay. So now I want to focus
on actually how to solve this problem

2458
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:54,480
on actually how to solve this problem
 

2459
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,789
on actually how to solve this problem
and I'm going to give you a hint which

2460
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:56,799
and I'm going to give you a hint which
 

2461
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,630
and I'm going to give you a hint which
is that what matters is the SVD. Okay.

2462
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:00,640
is that what matters is the SVD. Okay.
 

2463
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,030
is that what matters is the SVD. Okay.
And turns out then that this is the

2464
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:03,040
And turns out then that this is the
 

2465
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,390
And turns out then that this is the
actual solution that you're going to

2466
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:04,400
actual solution that you're going to
 

2467
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,349
actual solution that you're going to
get. So let's now work together to

2468
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:07,359
get. So let's now work together to
 

2469
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,990
get. So let's now work together to
actually get this out. And I want to

2470
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:10,000
actually get this out. And I want to
 

2471
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,150
actually get this out. And I want to
rewrite this problem. Actually I'm going

2472
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:12,160
rewrite this problem. Actually I'm going
 

2473
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:24,230
rewrite this problem. Actually I'm going
to maybe add a page here.

2474
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:24,240

 

2475
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:32,150

Okay.

2476
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:32,160

 

2477
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,430

So here I'm thinking about this

2478
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:33,440
So here I'm thinking about this
 

2479
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,789
So here I'm thinking about this
minimization of this um matrix in our

2480
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:36,799
minimization of this um matrix in our
 

2481
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:40,789
minimization of this um matrix in our
product. I can just as well think about

2482
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:40,799
product. I can just as well think about
 

2483
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,030
product. I can just as well think about
the maximization of the negative. So I

2484
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:43,040
the maximization of the negative. So I
 

2485
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,109
the maximization of the negative. So I
can think about this as max of let's

2486
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:45,119
can think about this as max of let's
 

2487
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,109
can think about this as max of let's
just to simplify the notation think

2488
00:59:47,109 --> 00:59:47,119
just to simplify the notation think
 

2489
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,870
just to simplify the notation think
about this as the max of arpose b such

2490
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:50,880
about this as the max of arpose b such
 

2491
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:58,309
about this as the max of arpose b such
that

2492
00:59:58,309 --> 00:59:58,319

 

2493
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,390

the two norm of b has some bound let's

2494
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:00,400
the two norm of b has some bound let's
 

2495
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,510
the two norm of b has some bound let's
just say one

2496
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:03,520
just say one
 

2497
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:08,150
just say one
um and sorry I meant to say here

2498
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:08,160

 

2499
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,470

trace of

2500
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:12,480
trace of
 

2501
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,309
trace of
Okay.

2502
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:16,319

 

2503
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,750

So, pull out all of the SVD that has

2504
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:19,760
So, pull out all of the SVD that has
 

2505
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,950
So, pull out all of the SVD that has
been coming back to your brain from

2506
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:20,960
been coming back to your brain from
 

2507
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,950
been coming back to your brain from
doing all of this homework. Um, and a

2508
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:24,960
doing all of this homework. Um, and a
 

2509
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,589
doing all of this homework. Um, and a
reminder of different properties of

2510
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:27,599
reminder of different properties of
 

2511
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:31,990
reminder of different properties of
trace. Remember that trace of

2512
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:32,000
trace. Remember that trace of
 

2513
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,829
trace. Remember that trace of
a B C is equal to trace of

2514
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:37,839
a B C is equal to trace of
 

2515
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,230
a B C is equal to trace of
B CA.

2516
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:40,240
B CA.
 

2517
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,069
B CA.
and you know spend a few minutes trying

2518
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:42,079
and you know spend a few minutes trying
 

2519
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,309
and you know spend a few minutes trying
to figure out how you might go about

2520
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:44,319
to figure out how you might go about
 

2521
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:45,670
to figure out how you might go about
doing actually this optimization

2522
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:45,680
doing actually this optimization
 

2523
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,829
doing actually this optimization
problem. So think about it and we'll

2524
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:47,839
problem. So think about it and we'll
 

2525
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:51,190
problem. So think about it and we'll
come back together to work on it.

2526
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:51,200
come back together to work on it.
 

2527
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,349
come back together to work on it.
Before I do that, any questions about

2528
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:53,359
Before I do that, any questions about
 

2529
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,990
Before I do that, any questions about
this setup? We're we're good, right?

2530
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:56,000
this setup? We're we're good, right?
 

2531
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,829
this setup? We're we're good, right?
Okay.

2532
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:57,839
Okay.
 

2533
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,750
Okay.
So take some time talk to talk to each

2534
01:00:59,750 --> 01:00:59,760
So take some time talk to talk to each
 

2535
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,510
So take some time talk to talk to each
other. Make sure you've unders you're

2536
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:01,520
other. Make sure you've unders you're
 

2537
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:32,789
other. Make sure you've unders you're
with me.

2538
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:32,799

 

2539
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:37,430

Oh my

2540
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:37,440

 

2541
01:01:37,440 --> 01:02:10,470

god.

2542
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:10,480

 

2543
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:23,750

Everyone

2544
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:23,760

 

2545
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:35,030

listening.

2546
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:35,040

Facebook.

2548
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,160

 

2549
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,630

Do you know what validator is?

2550
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:54,640
Do you know what validator is?
 

2551
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,510
Do you know what validator is?
about linearization

2552
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:57,520
about linearization
 

2553
01:02:57,520 --> 01:04:13,190
about linearization
because you know you discuss like how

2554
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:13,200

 

2555
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,549

Yeah, let me take Okay, there's a

2556
01:04:14,549 --> 01:04:14,559
Yeah, let me take Okay, there's a
 

2557
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,190
Yeah, let me take Okay, there's a
question.

2558
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:17,200
question.
 

2559
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:32,470
question.
>> Um, are you on

2560
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:32,480

 

2561
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:37,750

divide each of the

2562
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:37,760

 

2563
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,589

UI

2564
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:39,599
UI
 

2565
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:44,150
UI
I don't know how to

2566
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,160

 

2567
01:04:44,160 --> 01:05:26,710

feel like

2568
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:26,720

 

2569
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:33,270

Okay, let's come back together on this.

2570
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:33,280

 

2571
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,589

Okay. So, anyone have any ideas on what

2572
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:35,599
Okay. So, anyone have any ideas on what
 

2573
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,950
Okay. So, anyone have any ideas on what
we could do

2574
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:38,960

 

2575
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,670

>> here?

2576
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:43,680

 

2577
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,109

In the interest of time, I guess I'm not

2578
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
In the interest of time, I guess I'm not
 

2579
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,069
In the interest of time, I guess I'm not
going to write this whole thing out

2580
01:05:46,069 --> 01:05:46,079
going to write this whole thing out
 

2581
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,789
going to write this whole thing out
again. I thought I would, but I don't

2582
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:48,799
again. I thought I would, but I don't
 

2583
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,750
again. I thought I would, but I don't
have as much time as I thought I did.

2584
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:51,760
have as much time as I thought I did.
 

2585
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,589
have as much time as I thought I did.
So, let's look at the way to um let's

2586
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:55,599
So, let's look at the way to um let's
 

2587
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:01,190
So, let's look at the way to um let's
look at the way to do this.

2588
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,200

 

2589
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:07,510

So I have my uh optimization here

2590
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:07,520
So I have my uh optimization here
 

2591
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,430
So I have my uh optimization here
and there's a good principle of when in

2592
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,440
and there's a good principle of when in
 

2593
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,069
and there's a good principle of when in
doubt use the SVD that kind of works. Uh

2594
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:12,079
doubt use the SVD that kind of works. Uh
 

2595
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:13,430
doubt use the SVD that kind of works. Uh
especially if you're trying to look at

2596
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,440
especially if you're trying to look at
 

2597
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,950
especially if you're trying to look at
how big your step should be. So B is my

2598
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960
how big your step should be. So B is my
 

2599
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,309
how big your step should be. So B is my
optimization variable. I don't know

2600
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:18,319
optimization variable. I don't know
 

2601
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:20,069
optimization variable. I don't know
anything about B. A is the matrix that I

2602
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:20,079
anything about B. A is the matrix that I
 

2603
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:24,069
anything about B. A is the matrix that I
know. Let me plug in the SVD of A, which

2604
01:06:24,069 --> 01:06:24,079
know. Let me plug in the SVD of A, which
 

2605
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:27,589
know. Let me plug in the SVD of A, which
is that A is U sigma VRpose. Okay, so

2606
01:06:27,589 --> 01:06:27,599
is that A is U sigma VRpose. Okay, so
 

2607
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:28,549
is that A is U sigma VRpose. Okay, so
I'm just going to rewrite my

2608
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:28,559
I'm just going to rewrite my
 

2609
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,430
I'm just going to rewrite my
optimization problem this way. And

2610
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:31,440
optimization problem this way. And
 

2611
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,710
optimization problem this way. And
remember now that I have a transpose

2612
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:32,720
remember now that I have a transpose
 

2613
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,910
remember now that I have a transpose
here, this is V sigma transpose urpose.

2614
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:35,920
here, this is V sigma transpose urpose.
 

2615
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,510
here, this is V sigma transpose urpose.
Okay, everyone with me there? I just

2616
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:39,520
Okay, everyone with me there? I just
 

2617
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,789
Okay, everyone with me there? I just
plugged in the SVD.

2618
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:42,799
plugged in the SVD.
 

2619
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,390
plugged in the SVD.
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to

2620
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 

2621
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,470
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
say well

2622
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:48,480

 

2623
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,630

this is one very nice form of the SVD

2624
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
this is one very nice form of the SVD
 

2625
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,309
this is one very nice form of the SVD
but I actually want to think about this

2626
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:54,319
but I actually want to think about this
 

2627
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,549
but I actually want to think about this
in my outer product form of the SVD. So

2628
01:06:56,549 --> 01:06:56,559
in my outer product form of the SVD. So
 

2629
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,349
in my outer product form of the SVD. So
I'm going to write it as the sum over

2630
01:06:59,349 --> 01:06:59,359
I'm going to write it as the sum over
 

2631
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:03,190
I'm going to write it as the sum over
sigma i vi ui transpose. Note that I

2632
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:03,200
sigma i vi ui transpose. Note that I
 

2633
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,109
sigma i vi ui transpose. Note that I
have this transpose of the outer product

2634
01:07:05,109 --> 01:07:05,119
have this transpose of the outer product
 

2635
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,270
have this transpose of the outer product
form right? So this different should be

2636
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:07,280
form right? So this different should be
 

2637
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,349
form right? So this different should be
different from how you remember the SVD.

2638
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:09,359
different from how you remember the SVD.
 

2639
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,349
different from how you remember the SVD.
That should be UV transpose. But here

2640
01:07:11,349 --> 01:07:11,359
That should be UV transpose. But here
 

2641
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:14,789
That should be UV transpose. But here
now I have a V ui transpose.

2642
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:14,799
now I have a V ui transpose.
 

2643
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:19,589
now I have a V ui transpose.
Okay. So the order of this matters.

2644
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:19,599

 

2645
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,270

How many people want a minute after this

2646
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:21,280
How many people want a minute after this
 

2647
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,789
How many people want a minute after this
step to actually just try to work it out

2648
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:22,799
step to actually just try to work it out
 

2649
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:26,069
step to actually just try to work it out
themselves?

2650
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079

 

2651
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,309

No one. Like just give me the answer

2652
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:28,319
No one. Like just give me the answer
 

2653
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,710
No one. Like just give me the answer
quick. You want to do it yourself? Okay.

2654
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:30,720
quick. You want to do it yourself? Okay.
 

2655
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,950
quick. You want to do it yourself? Okay.
Take a minute. Take one minute to just

2656
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:32,960
Take a minute. Take one minute to just
 

2657
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:39,650
Take a minute. Take one minute to just
Yeah. See if you can move from here.

2658
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:39,660

 

2659
01:07:39,660 --> 01:08:04,870

[Laughter]

2660
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:04,880

 

2661
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,390

I'll give you a hint. When you have a

2662
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:06,400
I'll give you a hint. When you have a
 

2663
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,390
I'll give you a hint. When you have a
trace of a matrix and it's a big

2664
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:08,400
trace of a matrix and it's a big
 

2665
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,549
trace of a matrix and it's a big
unwieldy thing,

2666
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:10,559
unwieldy thing,
 

2667
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,069
unwieldy thing,
I don't really know how to take a trace

2668
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:12,079
I don't really know how to take a trace
 

2669
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:14,789
I don't really know how to take a trace
of a you can't hear me or you can't hear

2670
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:14,799
of a you can't hear me or you can't hear
 

2671
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:19,430
of a you can't hear me or you can't hear
me. Okay, my mic is fine, right? Okay.

2672
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:19,440
me. Okay, my mic is fine, right? Okay.
 

2673
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,269
me. Okay, my mic is fine, right? Okay.
The fa people's faces make me they make

2674
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:21,279
The fa people's faces make me they make
 

2675
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,430
The fa people's faces make me they make
me feel like you can't hear me at all.

2676
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:23,440
me feel like you can't hear me at all.
 

2677
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,749
me feel like you can't hear me at all.
Okay. Okay.

2678
01:08:25,749 --> 01:08:25,759
Okay. Okay.
 

2679
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:28,550
Okay. Okay.
But when you have a trace of a matrix or

2680
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:28,560
But when you have a trace of a matrix or
 

2681
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,550
But when you have a trace of a matrix or
it's a product of things, what would be

2682
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:30,560
it's a product of things, what would be
 

2683
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,070
it's a product of things, what would be
really nice? What is the best kind of

2684
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:32,080
really nice? What is the best kind of
 

2685
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,669
really nice? What is the best kind of
thing? What is the best kind of matrix

2686
01:08:33,669 --> 01:08:33,679
thing? What is the best kind of matrix
 

2687
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,309
thing? What is the best kind of matrix
to take a trace of?

2688
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:36,319
to take a trace of?
 

2689
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,070
to take a trace of?
>> Diagonal. Diagonals are great. What's

2690
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:38,080
>> Diagonal. Diagonals are great. What's
 

2691
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,550
>> Diagonal. Diagonals are great. What's
better than diagonal?

2692
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,560
better than diagonal?
 

2693
01:08:40,560 --> 01:09:02,789
better than diagonal?
>> Scalers.

01:09:02,789 --> 01:09:02,799

 

2695
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:15,910

Why didn't

2696
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:15,920

 

2697
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:54,470

Oh yeah, you can

2698
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:54,480

 

2699
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,390

Okay. So let's come together.

2700
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:58,400
Okay. So let's come together.
 

2701
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,270
Okay. So let's come together.
So in that light of how can I make this

2702
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:01,280
So in that light of how can I make this
 

2703
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,350
So in that light of how can I make this
into a scalar?

2704
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:03,360
into a scalar?
 

2705
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,669
into a scalar?
Well, I have this

2706
01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:05,679
Well, I have this
 

2707
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,270
Well, I have this
and I look at this. This is a trace of

2708
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:07,280
and I look at this. This is a trace of
 

2709
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,510
and I look at this. This is a trace of
these sums.

2710
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:09,520
these sums.
 

2711
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,350
these sums.
But I don't like sums of matrices. Sums

2712
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:11,360
But I don't like sums of matrices. Sums
 

2713
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,709
But I don't like sums of matrices. Sums
of matrices are complicated. So nice

2714
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:14,719
of matrices are complicated. So nice
 

2715
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:15,990
of matrices are complicated. So nice
thing about a trace is it's a linear

2716
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:16,000
thing about a trace is it's a linear
 

2717
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,149
thing about a trace is it's a linear
operation, right? So I can pull this sum

2718
01:10:18,149 --> 01:10:18,159
operation, right? So I can pull this sum
 

2719
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:21,270
operation, right? So I can pull this sum
out and put the trace in. Okay. So I can

2720
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:21,280
out and put the trace in. Okay. So I can
 

2721
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,790
out and put the trace in. Okay. So I can
think of this as a sum of the traces of

2722
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:22,800
think of this as a sum of the traces of
 

2723
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,310
think of this as a sum of the traces of
each of these individual matrices. Good.

2724
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:26,320
each of these individual matrices. Good.
 

2725
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,070
each of these individual matrices. Good.
So here we can say this is because trace

2726
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:28,080
So here we can say this is because trace
 

2727
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:33,830
So here we can say this is because trace
is linear.

2728
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:33,840

 

2729
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,430

Okay,

2730
01:10:35,430 --> 01:10:35,440
Okay,
 

2731
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,110
Okay,
good.

2732
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,120
good.
 

2733
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,950
good.
And now

2734
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:38,960
And now
 

2735
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,189
And now
I can apply my other favorite property

2736
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:41,199
I can apply my other favorite property
 

2737
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,950
I can apply my other favorite property
about traces which is that I can do

2738
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:44,960
about traces which is that I can do
 

2739
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,030
about traces which is that I can do
circular shifts of the matrix inside my

2740
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:47,040
circular shifts of the matrix inside my
 

2741
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,630
circular shifts of the matrix inside my
trace operation but maintain the trace.

2742
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:50,640
trace operation but maintain the trace.
 

2743
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,270
trace operation but maintain the trace.
Right? So here I have this sigma i. This

2744
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
Right? So here I have this sigma i. This
 

2745
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,350
Right? So here I have this sigma i. This
is just a scalar. So again the trace is

2746
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:55,360
is just a scalar. So again the trace is
 

2747
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,030
is just a scalar. So again the trace is
linear. The sigma i really just pops

2748
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,040
linear. The sigma i really just pops
 

2749
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,550
linear. The sigma i really just pops
out.

2750
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,560
out.
 

2751
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,550
out.
But I can circularly shift these three

2752
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:00,560
But I can circularly shift these three
 

2753
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,229
But I can circularly shift these three
matrices that are in here. These are yes

2754
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:02,239
matrices that are in here. These are yes
 

2755
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:03,910
matrices that are in here. These are yes
u and v are vectors but I can think of

2756
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:03,920
u and v are vectors but I can think of
 

2757
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,470
u and v are vectors but I can think of
them as uh matrices

2758
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:06,480
them as uh matrices
 

2759
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,030
them as uh matrices
and I can do this circular shift. And

2760
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:09,040
and I can do this circular shift. And
 

2761
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,830
and I can do this circular shift. And
when I move this vi

2762
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:11,840
when I move this vi
 

2763
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,390
when I move this vi
over to this side,

2764
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,400
over to this side,
 

2765
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:22,070
over to this side,
what do I get? Well, I get upose b vi.

2766
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:22,080
what do I get? Well, I get upose b vi.
 

2767
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:29,270
what do I get? Well, I get upose b vi.
This thing is just a scalar.

2768
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:29,280

 

2769
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,590

Okay.

2770
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:31,600
Okay.
 

2771
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,950
Okay.
And now this is just a scalar. So what

2772
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:34,960
And now this is just a scalar. So what
 

2773
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,709
And now this is just a scalar. So what
is a trace of a scalar? Well,

2774
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:38,719
is a trace of a scalar? Well,
 

2775
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,990
is a trace of a scalar? Well,
it's just this quantity.

2776
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,000
it's just this quantity.
 

2777
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,870
it's just this quantity.
And now I have this UI transpose B vi

2778
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:44,880
And now I have this UI transpose B vi
 

2779
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,709
And now I have this UI transpose B vi
right here.

2780
01:11:46,709 --> 01:11:46,719
right here.
 

2781
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,229
right here.
Well, now what can I say about this

2782
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:48,239
Well, now what can I say about this
 

2783
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,790
Well, now what can I say about this
thing? Well, this is a matrix times a

2784
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:50,800
thing? Well, this is a matrix times a
 

2785
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,790
thing? Well, this is a matrix times a
vector.

2786
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:52,800
vector.
 

2787
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,590
vector.
So what do I know about B * VI? Okay.

2788
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:55,600
So what do I know about B * VI? Okay.
 

2789
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,270
So what do I know about B * VI? Okay.
Well, I know that the length of this

2790
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:57,280
Well, I know that the length of this
 

2791
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,709
Well, I know that the length of this
vector is bounded by the norms of these

2792
01:12:00,709 --> 01:12:00,719
vector is bounded by the norms of these
 

2793
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:03,990
vector is bounded by the norms of these
individual vectors. So, this is a SVD.

2794
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:04,000
individual vectors. So, this is a SVD.
 

2795
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,950
individual vectors. So, this is a SVD.
This is a this is this is norm one vi.

2796
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:06,960
This is a this is this is norm one vi.
 

2797
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,470
This is a this is this is norm one vi.
And what are we assuming? We're assuming

2798
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:08,480
And what are we assuming? We're assuming
 

2799
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,229
And what are we assuming? We're assuming
that the two norm or the spectral norm

2800
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:10,239
that the two norm or the spectral norm
 

2801
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,110
that the two norm or the spectral norm
of b is bounded by one. So, this is at

2802
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:13,120
of b is bounded by one. So, this is at
 

2803
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,189
of b is bounded by one. So, this is at
most one, right?

2804
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:15,199
most one, right?
 

2805
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,669
most one, right?
And then I can think of u transpose

2806
01:12:17,669 --> 01:12:17,679
And then I can think of u transpose
 

2807
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,870
And then I can think of u transpose
times this vector here.

2808
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:20,880
times this vector here.
 

2809
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,270
times this vector here.
And again, koshwarz just tells me that

2810
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:23,280
And again, koshwarz just tells me that
 

2811
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,390
And again, koshwarz just tells me that
this is also bounded by one.

2812
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:26,400
this is also bounded by one.
 

2813
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,790
this is also bounded by one.
Okay.

2814
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:28,800
Okay.
 

2815
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,790
Okay.
So what I can get out is here now just

2816
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:30,800
So what I can get out is here now just
 

2817
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,709
So what I can get out is here now just
the sum of the singular values.

2818
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:34,719
the sum of the singular values.
 

2819
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:37,590
the sum of the singular values.
So I get this as an upper bound to show

2820
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:37,600
So I get this as an upper bound to show
 

2821
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,910
So I get this as an upper bound to show
that this is actually achievable. I need

2822
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:39,920
that this is actually achievable. I need
 

2823
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,430
that this is actually achievable. I need
to show that well I can actually choose

2824
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:41,440
to show that well I can actually choose
 

2825
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,110
to show that well I can actually choose
a B that attains this bound. Right?

2826
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:45,120
a B that attains this bound. Right?
 

2827
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,110
a B that attains this bound. Right?
And turns out if I choose this B is

2828
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:47,120
And turns out if I choose this B is
 

2829
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,669
And turns out if I choose this B is
equal to UVRpose well I can just plug

2830
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:49,679
equal to UVRpose well I can just plug
 

2831
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,950
equal to UVRpose well I can just plug
this back in here.

2832
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:52,960
this back in here.
 

2833
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,510
this back in here.
If B is UVRpose, this uranspose U is

2834
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:55,520
If B is UVRpose, this uranspose U is
 

2835
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,430
If B is UVRpose, this uranspose U is
going to cancel.

2836
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:57,440
going to cancel.
 

2837
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,350
going to cancel.
And again, the circularity properties of

2838
01:12:59,350 --> 01:12:59,360
And again, the circularity properties of
 

2839
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,590
And again, the circularity properties of
the trace are going to give me that this

2840
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:01,600
the trace are going to give me that this
 

2841
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,350
the trace are going to give me that this
will actually give me exactly the sum of

2842
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:03,360
will actually give me exactly the sum of
 

2843
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:07,910
will actually give me exactly the sum of
the singular values.

2844
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:07,920

 

2845
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,390

Just to see that you can see that

2846
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:12,400

 

2847
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,030

write in a different color.

2848
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:15,040
write in a different color.
 

2849
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,590
write in a different color.
um v sigma transpose

2850
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:19,600
um v sigma transpose
 

2851
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,350
um v sigma transpose
uranspose u v.

2852
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:23,360
uranspose u v.
 

2853
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,229
uranspose u v.
If I take the trace of this,

2854
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:26,239
If I take the trace of this,
 

2855
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:29,510
If I take the trace of this,
this is equal to just the trace of sigma

2856
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:29,520
this is equal to just the trace of sigma
 

2857
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:39,669
this is equal to just the trace of sigma
transpose.

2858
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:39,679

 

2859
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:43,030

Okay, good.

2860
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
Okay, good.
 

2861
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,870
Okay, good.
Everyone with me on this optimization

2862
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:44,880
Everyone with me on this optimization
 

2863
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,709
Everyone with me on this optimization
problem. Okay. So you can solve this

2864
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:46,719
problem. Okay. So you can solve this
 

2865
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:49,990
problem. Okay. So you can solve this
optimization problem and what we get

2866
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:50,000
optimization problem and what we get
 

2867
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,030
optimization problem and what we get
question.

2868
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:51,040
question.
 

2869
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,030
question.
>> Uh yeah it was I guess more practical of

2870
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:53,040
>> Uh yeah it was I guess more practical of
 

2871
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,790
>> Uh yeah it was I guess more practical of
like I remember we talked earlier that

2872
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:54,800
like I remember we talked earlier that
 

2873
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,030
like I remember we talked earlier that
finding the SV of your gradient every

2874
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:57,040
finding the SV of your gradient every
 

2875
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,189
finding the SV of your gradient every
step is kind of expensive right?

2876
01:13:59,189 --> 01:13:59,199
step is kind of expensive right?
 

2877
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:03,669
step is kind of expensive right?
>> Yeah. So great question. So here the

2878
01:14:03,669 --> 01:14:03,679
>> Yeah. So great question. So here the
 

2879
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,669
>> Yeah. So great question. So here the
point that is being made is that look

2880
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:07,679
point that is being made is that look
 

2881
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:11,110
point that is being made is that look
this B is UVRpose

2882
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,120
this B is UVRpose
 

2883
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,709
this B is UVRpose
and you're saying that okay now just

2884
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:12,719
and you're saying that okay now just
 

2885
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,790
and you're saying that okay now just
choose this B and choose this step UV

2886
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:14,800
choose this B and choose this step UV
 

2887
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,229
choose this B and choose this step UV
transpose but how are you going to find

2888
01:14:18,229 --> 01:14:18,239
transpose but how are you going to find
 

2889
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,390
transpose but how are you going to find
this U and V right that's actually an

2890
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,400
this U and V right that's actually an
 

2891
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,950
this U and V right that's actually an
expensive operation it's not trivial to

2892
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:22,960
expensive operation it's not trivial to
 

2893
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,149
expensive operation it's not trivial to
find that so you can't just say well

2894
01:14:24,149 --> 01:14:24,159
find that so you can't just say well
 

2895
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,070
find that so you can't just say well
look I found this fancy new optimizer I

2896
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:26,080
look I found this fancy new optimizer I
 

2897
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,070
look I found this fancy new optimizer I
just can never implement it uh it's

2898
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:28,080
just can never implement it uh it's
 

2899
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,750
just can never implement it uh it's
great to put on my wall but I can't use

2900
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:29,760
great to put on my wall but I can't use
 

2901
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,990
great to put on my wall but I can't use
it why is this still a good optimizer.

2902
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,000
it why is this still a good optimizer.
 

2903
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,910
it why is this still a good optimizer.
Two things. One is that what uh the

2904
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:35,920
Two things. One is that what uh the
 

2905
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,070
Two things. One is that what uh the
shampoo algorithm and what we're going

2906
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:38,080
shampoo algorithm and what we're going
 

2907
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,510
shampoo algorithm and what we're going
to talk about in the next lecture

2908
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:41,520
to talk about in the next lecture
 

2909
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,470
to talk about in the next lecture
introduced ways of computing things like

2910
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:44,480
introduced ways of computing things like
 

2911
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,950
introduced ways of computing things like
UV transpose that are computationally

2912
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:46,960
UV transpose that are computationally
 

2913
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,709
UV transpose that are computationally
efficient.

2914
01:14:48,709 --> 01:14:48,719
efficient.
 

2915
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,030
efficient.
Uh we will talk about one such technique

2916
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,040
Uh we will talk about one such technique
 

2917
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:55,510
Uh we will talk about one such technique
in the in the next class.

2918
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:55,520
in the in the next class.
 

2919
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,030
in the in the next class.
Um

2920
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:57,040
Um
 

2921
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,830
Um
so yeah that's basically the uh the

2922
01:14:59,830 --> 01:14:59,840
so yeah that's basically the uh the
 

2923
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,550
so yeah that's basically the uh the
short answer and one other perspective

2924
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:02,560
short answer and one other perspective
 

2925
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,790
short answer and one other perspective
is that even if we're not able to

2926
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
is that even if we're not able to
 

2927
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,350
is that even if we're not able to
compute this having this as a

2928
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:07,360
compute this having this as a
 

2929
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,070
compute this having this as a
perspective is still useful for us in

2930
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:10,080
perspective is still useful for us in
 

2931
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,470
perspective is still useful for us in
terms of thinking about our recipe and

2932
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:12,480
terms of thinking about our recipe and
 

2933
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,070
terms of thinking about our recipe and
can we turn the crank and turn out new

2934
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,080
can we turn the crank and turn out new
 

2935
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,830
can we turn the crank and turn out new
optimizers.

2936
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:15,840
optimizers.
 

2937
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,910
optimizers.
Good question.

2938
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:17,920
Good question.
 

2939
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,390
Good question.
Everyone with me?

2940
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400
Everyone with me?
 

2941
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,750
Everyone with me?
Okay good.

2942
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:23,760
Okay good.
 

2943
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,750
Okay good.
So what this is recipe is pointing to

2944
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:25,760
So what this is recipe is pointing to
 

2945
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,990
So what this is recipe is pointing to
and that's kind of what this uh paper

2946
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:28,000
and that's kind of what this uh paper
 

2947
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,510
and that's kind of what this uh paper
that I mentioned at the beginning of

2948
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:29,520
that I mentioned at the beginning of
 

2949
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,990
that I mentioned at the beginning of
class is talking about is that we can we

2950
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:32,000
class is talking about is that we can we
 

2951
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,709
class is talking about is that we can we
have this recipe that says okay you can

2952
01:15:34,709 --> 01:15:34,719
have this recipe that says okay you can
 

2953
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,550
have this recipe that says okay you can
choose a norm you can choose a step size

2954
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
choose a norm you can choose a step size
 

2955
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,070
choose a norm you can choose a step size
and you can generate new optimizers.

2956
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:40,080
and you can generate new optimizers.
 

2957
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,390
and you can generate new optimizers.
Okay so can we use this recipe to

2958
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:44,400
Okay so can we use this recipe to
 

2959
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,709
Okay so can we use this recipe to
actually produce new optimizers that can

2960
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:46,719
actually produce new optimizers that can
 

2961
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,750
actually produce new optimizers that can
do better. Okay. And to be able to see

2962
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:49,760
do better. Okay. And to be able to see
 

2963
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,750
do better. Okay. And to be able to see
this, what one thing we might want to

2964
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:51,760
this, what one thing we might want to
 

2965
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,430
this, what one thing we might want to
think about is really what might be a

2966
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:55,440
think about is really what might be a
 

2967
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,790
think about is really what might be a
good norm for deep learning, right? How

2968
01:15:58,790 --> 01:15:58,800
good norm for deep learning, right? How
 

2969
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,229
good norm for deep learning, right? How
do we think about what is the right

2970
01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:00,239
do we think about what is the right
 

2971
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:01,270
do we think about what is the right
norm? How do we think about this

2972
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:01,280
norm? How do we think about this
 

2973
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,550
norm? How do we think about this
question of which is the right norm to

2974
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:02,560
question of which is the right norm to
 

2975
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,149
question of which is the right norm to
choose, right? Uh the ones we're

2976
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:04,159
choose, right? Uh the ones we're
 

2977
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:07,430
choose, right? Uh the ones we're
choosing are somewhat arbitrary.

2978
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:07,440
choosing are somewhat arbitrary.
 

2979
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,350
choosing are somewhat arbitrary.
So to think about this, let's recap what

2980
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:09,360
So to think about this, let's recap what
 

2981
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,390
So to think about this, let's recap what
we talked about Xavier initialization.

2982
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:12,400
we talked about Xavier initialization.
 

2983
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,149
we talked about Xavier initialization.
And there we said look if you have a

2984
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:14,159
And there we said look if you have a
 

2985
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:15,430
And there we said look if you have a
bunch of different inputs that are

2986
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:15,440
bunch of different inputs that are
 

2987
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,590
bunch of different inputs that are
coming into u the network and I want to

2988
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:19,600
coming into u the network and I want to
 

2989
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,310
coming into u the network and I want to
have the output be approximately normal

2990
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:22,320
have the output be approximately normal
 

2991
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,390
have the output be approximately normal
01 when my inputs were approximately

2992
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:24,400
01 when my inputs were approximately
 

2993
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,310
01 when my inputs were approximately
normal 01.

2994
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:26,320
normal 01.
 

2995
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:30,149
normal 01.
What we said was well let's scale by

2996
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:30,159
What we said was well let's scale by
 

2997
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,709
What we said was well let's scale by
this fan in right

2998
01:16:32,709 --> 01:16:32,719
this fan in right
 

2999
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,550
this fan in right
and if we choose an appropriate

3000
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:34,560
and if we choose an appropriate
 

3001
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,270
and if we choose an appropriate
initialization for these W's

3002
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:37,280
initialization for these W's
 

3003
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,030
initialization for these W's
that that's a good way of thinking about

3004
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:39,040
that that's a good way of thinking about
 

3005
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,790
that that's a good way of thinking about
it

3006
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:40,800
it
 

3007
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,709
it
and that will help us get make sure that

3008
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:42,719
and that will help us get make sure that
 

3009
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,630
and that will help us get make sure that
our norms are not changing between the

3010
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:44,640
our norms are not changing between the
 

3011
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,430
our norms are not changing between the
input and the output

3012
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:47,440
input and the output
 

3013
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,510
input and the output
if we wanted to think about Xavier

3014
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:49,520
if we wanted to think about Xavier
 

3015
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,430
if we wanted to think about Xavier
initialization

3016
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:51,440
initialization
 

3017
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,830
initialization
in terms of norms if you want to think

3018
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:53,840
in terms of norms if you want to think
 

3019
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,149
in terms of norms if you want to think
what is the norm what is the norm like

3020
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:56,159
what is the norm what is the norm like
 

3021
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,390
what is the norm what is the norm like
property of our inputs that is not

3022
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:58,400
property of our inputs that is not
 

3023
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,310
property of our inputs that is not
changing

3024
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:00,320
changing
 

3025
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,189
changing
at the output. What is the right norm to

3026
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:03,199
at the output. What is the right norm to
 

3027
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,030
at the output. What is the right norm to
think about?

3028
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
think about?
 

3029
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,790
think about?
Well,

3030
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:06,800
Well,
 

3031
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,070
Well,
you know, the natural thing is to say

3032
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:08,080
you know, the natural thing is to say
 

3033
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,510
you know, the natural thing is to say
like, well, if this is norm one, make

3034
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:09,520
like, well, if this is norm one, make
 

3035
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,950
like, well, if this is norm one, make
this norm one. That's kind of just

3036
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
this norm one. That's kind of just
 

3037
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,470
this norm one. That's kind of just
and if it's if you think about this in

3038
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:14,480
and if it's if you think about this in
 

3039
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,830
and if it's if you think about this in
the two norm sense if you think about

3040
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:15,840
the two norm sense if you think about
 

3041
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,870
the two norm sense if you think about
this in the ukidian norm sense well if

3042
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:18,880
this in the ukidian norm sense well if
 

3043
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,750
this in the ukidian norm sense well if
this vector had norm one

3044
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:21,760
this vector had norm one
 

3045
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,750
this vector had norm one
Xavier doesn't really imply that this

3046
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:23,760
Xavier doesn't really imply that this
 

3047
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,630
Xavier doesn't really imply that this
output h is going to be norm one right

3048
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:26,640
output h is going to be norm one right
 

3049
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,870
output h is going to be norm one right
because I have this input and I have

3050
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:28,880
because I have this input and I have
 

3051
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,149
because I have this input and I have
this output and they have different

3052
01:17:30,149 --> 01:17:30,159
this output and they have different
 

3053
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:32,470
this output and they have different
dimensions

3054
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:32,480
dimensions
 

3055
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,030
dimensions
okay

3056
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,040
okay
 

3057
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,510
okay
instead what Xavier is trying to talk

3058
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:37,520
instead what Xavier is trying to talk
 

3059
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,229
instead what Xavier is trying to talk
about is trying to say let's look at the

3060
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:40,239
about is trying to say let's look at the
 

3061
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:43,189
about is trying to say let's look at the
entries of this vector x and I want them

3062
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:43,199
entries of this vector x and I want them
 

3063
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:47,350
entries of this vector x and I want them
all to be kind of

3064
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:47,360
all to be kind of
 

3065
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,950
all to be kind of
roughly

3066
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:48,960
roughly
 

3067
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,830
roughly
uh you know like roughly of variance one

3068
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:51,840
uh you know like roughly of variance one
 

3069
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,950
uh you know like roughly of variance one
so mean zero variance one and so if I

3070
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:54,960
so mean zero variance one and so if I
 

3071
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,430
so mean zero variance one and so if I
want to get rid of the effect of the

3072
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:57,440
want to get rid of the effect of the
 

3073
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,750
want to get rid of the effect of the
number of x's they are or the dimension

3074
01:17:59,750 --> 01:17:59,760
number of x's they are or the dimension
 

3075
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,630
number of x's they are or the dimension
I can just scale by the dimension right

3076
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:02,640
I can just scale by the dimension right
 

3077
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,430
I can just scale by the dimension right
so I can think about instead of thinking

3078
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:05,440
so I can think about instead of thinking
 

3079
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,470
so I can think about instead of thinking
about the ukitian norm one what if I

3080
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:08,480
about the ukitian norm one what if I
 

3081
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,950
about the ukitian norm one what if I
thought about what is called the RMS or

3082
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:10,960
thought about what is called the RMS or
 

3083
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,189
thought about what is called the RMS or
the root mean squared norm. This is

3084
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
the root mean squared norm. This is
 

3085
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:19,270
the root mean squared norm. This is
called root mean squared.

3086
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:19,280

 

3087
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,830

Okay. So I define this root mean square

3088
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:21,840
Okay. So I define this root mean square
 

3089
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,510
Okay. So I define this root mean square
norm as I just take my uklidian norm but

3090
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:25,520
norm as I just take my uklidian norm but
 

3091
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,590
norm as I just take my uklidian norm but
I scale it

3092
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:27,600
I scale it
 

3093
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:33,430
I scale it
by the square root of the dimension.

3094
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:33,440

 

3095
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,310

And what this gives me is that if the

3096
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:36,320
And what this gives me is that if the
 

3097
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,550
And what this gives me is that if the
root mean square is one, then that's one

3098
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:38,560
root mean square is one, then that's one
 

3099
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,630
root mean square is one, then that's one
way of thinking about all of my entries

3100
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:40,640
way of thinking about all of my entries
 

3101
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,750
way of thinking about all of my entries
are one. This is now a relaxation,

3102
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:43,760
are one. This is now a relaxation,
 

3103
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,990
are one. This is now a relaxation,
right? If I want saying that every

3104
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:46,000
right? If I want saying that every
 

3105
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,750
right? If I want saying that every
single entry has norm one is a stricter

3106
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:49,760
single entry has norm one is a stricter
 

3107
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,310
single entry has norm one is a stricter
requirement than saying that my RMS norm

3108
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:52,320
requirement than saying that my RMS norm
 

3109
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,110
requirement than saying that my RMS norm
is one.

3110
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:55,120
is one.
 

3111
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,630
is one.
Does that make is is that clear to

3112
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:56,640
Does that make is is that clear to
 

3113
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,030
Does that make is is that clear to
everyone?

3114
01:18:59,030 --> 01:18:59,040
everyone?
 

3115
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,709
everyone?
But

3116
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:00,719
But
 

3117
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:02,870
But
in this perspective of like do what we

3118
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:02,880
in this perspective of like do what we
 

3119
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,750
in this perspective of like do what we
can, work with what we can, maybe one

3120
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:05,760
can, work with what we can, maybe one
 

3121
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,270
can, work with what we can, maybe one
interesting thing to think about is to

3122
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:07,280
interesting thing to think about is to
 

3123
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,510
interesting thing to think about is to
think about well can we look at the RMS

3124
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:09,520
think about well can we look at the RMS
 

3125
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,750
think about well can we look at the RMS
norms and make sure that the RMS norms

3126
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:11,760
norms and make sure that the RMS norms
 

3127
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,430
norms and make sure that the RMS norms
for example

3128
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:13,440
for example
 

3129
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,590
for example
uh are reasonable or look that look at

3130
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:15,600
uh are reasonable or look that look at
 

3131
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,510
uh are reasonable or look that look at
that as an interesting norm in the

3132
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:17,520
that as an interesting norm in the
 

3133
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,550
that as an interesting norm in the
context of deep learning. Okay, does

3134
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:20,560
context of deep learning. Okay, does
 

3135
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:25,669
context of deep learning. Okay, does
that make sense? Questions?

3136
01:19:25,669 --> 01:19:25,679

 

3137
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,430

All I'm trying to say is that just take

3138
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:27,440
All I'm trying to say is that just take
 

3139
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,510
All I'm trying to say is that just take
this perspective of what is Xavier

3140
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:29,520
this perspective of what is Xavier
 

3141
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:31,590
this perspective of what is Xavier
trying to keep unchanging. It's trying

3142
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:31,600
trying to keep unchanging. It's trying
 

3143
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,750
trying to keep unchanging. It's trying
to say even if I have a lot of things

3144
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:33,760
to say even if I have a lot of things
 

3145
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,750
to say even if I have a lot of things
summing in I don't want the dimension or

3146
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:35,760
summing in I don't want the dimension or
 

3147
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,310
summing in I don't want the dimension or
the number of inputs to affect how big

3148
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:38,320
the number of inputs to affect how big
 

3149
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,310
the number of inputs to affect how big
my output becomes. So I'm going to scale

3150
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:40,320
my output becomes. So I'm going to scale
 

3151
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,470
my output becomes. So I'm going to scale
by that factor. And that suggests

3152
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:42,480
by that factor. And that suggests
 

3153
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,390
by that factor. And that suggests
looking at something like this RMS norm

3154
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:44,400
looking at something like this RMS norm
 

3155
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,070
looking at something like this RMS norm
which naturally normalizes by the

3156
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:46,080
which naturally normalizes by the
 

3157
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,070
which naturally normalizes by the
dimension.

3158
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:48,080
dimension.
 

3159
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,790
dimension.
Okay.

3160
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:50,800
Okay.
 

3161
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,550
Okay.
So what this argues is well maybe this

3162
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:52,560
So what this argues is well maybe this
 

3163
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,709
So what this argues is well maybe this
RMS norm is interesting for deep neural

3164
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:54,719
RMS norm is interesting for deep neural
 

3165
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:56,229
RMS norm is interesting for deep neural
networks. Remember we started out by

3166
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:56,239
networks. Remember we started out by
 

3167
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,149
networks. Remember we started out by
saying how do we choose what the right

3168
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159
saying how do we choose what the right
 

3169
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:59,990
saying how do we choose what the right
norm is? So maybe this is an interesting

3170
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:00,000
norm is? So maybe this is an interesting
 

3171
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,110
norm is? So maybe this is an interesting
norm and we saw from this shampoo

3172
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:03,120
norm and we saw from this shampoo
 

3173
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:08,950
norm and we saw from this shampoo
example that actually maybe looking at

3174
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:08,960
example that actually maybe looking at
 

3175
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,070
example that actually maybe looking at
the matrix perspective

3176
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:12,080
the matrix perspective
 

3177
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,149
the matrix perspective
is valuable. Looking at this the fact

3178
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:14,159
is valuable. Looking at this the fact
 

3179
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:15,830
is valuable. Looking at this the fact
that think of your parameters as

3180
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:15,840
that think of your parameters as
 

3181
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,950
that think of your parameters as
matrices instead of vectors

3182
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:18,960
matrices instead of vectors
 

3183
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,910
matrices instead of vectors
is actually valuable. So can we think of

3184
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:21,920
is actually valuable. So can we think of
 

3185
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,870
is actually valuable. So can we think of
a norm that we can apply to matrices

3186
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:24,880
a norm that we can apply to matrices
 

3187
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:30,149
a norm that we can apply to matrices
that is like the RMS norm? Okay.

3188
01:20:30,149 --> 01:20:30,159
that is like the RMS norm? Okay.
 

3189
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,189
that is like the RMS norm? Okay.
So what I want to introduce now is this

3190
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:33,199
So what I want to introduce now is this
 

3191
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:37,430
So what I want to introduce now is this
idea of the RMS to RMS norm. So remember

3192
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:37,440
idea of the RMS to RMS norm. So remember
 

3193
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,950
idea of the RMS to RMS norm. So remember
we talked about the spectral norm

3194
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:38,960
we talked about the spectral norm
 

3195
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,870
we talked about the spectral norm
earlier and we talked about the spectral

3196
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:40,880
earlier and we talked about the spectral
 

3197
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,310
earlier and we talked about the spectral
norm as saying we define the spectral

3198
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:44,320
norm as saying we define the spectral
 

3199
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,189
norm as saying we define the spectral
norm of a as for example what is the

3200
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:47,199
norm of a as for example what is the
 

3201
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:51,189
norm of a as for example what is the
maximum that you can scale a vector when

3202
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:51,199
maximum that you can scale a vector when
 

3203
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:53,910
maximum that you can scale a vector when
the two norm of the vector is one. So if

3204
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:53,920
the two norm of the vector is one. So if
 

3205
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,590
the two norm of the vector is one. So if
I wanted to get the spectral norm I take

3206
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:55,600
I wanted to get the spectral norm I take
 

3207
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,270
I wanted to get the spectral norm I take
this induced norm definition and I put

3208
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:57,280
this induced norm definition and I put
 

3209
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,950
this induced norm definition and I put
alpha and beta both as two. Right?

3210
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:58,960
alpha and beta both as two. Right?
 

3211
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,950
alpha and beta both as two. Right?
Right. So if I take an input vector that

3212
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:00,960
Right. So if I take an input vector that
 

3213
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,390
Right. So if I take an input vector that
is norm that has two norm one that is a

3214
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:04,400
is norm that has two norm one that is a
 

3215
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,110
is norm that has two norm one that is a
in the unit ball in the two norm sense

3216
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:07,120
in the unit ball in the two norm sense
 

3217
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,990
in the unit ball in the two norm sense
and I see how big can a make that in the

3218
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:10,000
and I see how big can a make that in the
 

3219
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,070
and I see how big can a make that in the
two norm sense that gives me

3220
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,080
two norm sense that gives me
 

3221
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,430
two norm sense that gives me
uh the spectral norm. Okay. But I can

3222
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:17,440
uh the spectral norm. Okay. But I can
 

3223
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,510
uh the spectral norm. Okay. But I can
generalize this idea and get an induced

3224
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:19,520
generalize this idea and get an induced
 

3225
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,750
generalize this idea and get an induced
matrix norm that says that well two was

3226
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
matrix norm that says that well two was
 

3227
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,750
matrix norm that says that well two was
arbitrary.

3228
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:23,760
arbitrary.
 

3229
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,350
arbitrary.
Take your favorite norm here and take

3230
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
Take your favorite norm here and take
 

3231
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,870
Take your favorite norm here and take
your favorite norm here. Take for

3232
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:28,880
your favorite norm here. Take for
 

3233
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,790
your favorite norm here. Take for
example the alpha norm here and the beta

3234
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:30,800
example the alpha norm here and the beta
 

3235
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,709
example the alpha norm here and the beta
norm here. And if I give you something

3236
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:32,719
norm here. And if I give you something
 

3237
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,350
norm here. And if I give you something
in the alpha unit ball, how big can a

3238
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:35,360
in the alpha unit ball, how big can a
 

3239
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,590
in the alpha unit ball, how big can a
make it in the beta norm sense? That is

3240
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:37,600
make it in the beta norm sense? That is
 

3241
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,590
make it in the beta norm sense? That is
the induced norm. It's the same idea as

3242
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:39,600
the induced norm. It's the same idea as
 

3243
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,390
the induced norm. It's the same idea as
the spectral norm just generalized.

3244
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:42,400
the spectral norm just generalized.
 

3245
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,790
the spectral norm just generalized.
Okay,

3246
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:44,800
Okay,
 

3247
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,990
Okay,
with that now can we define an RMS to

3248
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:48,000
with that now can we define an RMS to
 

3249
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,310
with that now can we define an RMS to
RMS norm? And how I'm going to define

3250
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:50,320
RMS norm? And how I'm going to define
 

3251
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:55,669
RMS norm? And how I'm going to define
that is to say a RMS to RMS is to say

3252
01:21:55,669 --> 01:21:55,679
that is to say a RMS to RMS is to say
 

3253
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,310
that is to say a RMS to RMS is to say
how big can a scale X in the RMS norm

3254
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:00,320
how big can a scale X in the RMS norm
 

3255
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,629
how big can a scale X in the RMS norm
sense

3256
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639
sense
 

3257
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:05,830
sense
when the input is also restricted in the

3258
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:05,840
when the input is also restricted in the
 

3259
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,350
when the input is also restricted in the
RMS norm sense to be one

3260
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
RMS norm sense to be one
 

3261
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,590
RMS norm sense to be one
and remember the RMS norm is just the

3262
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:11,600
and remember the RMS norm is just the
 

3263
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,510
and remember the RMS norm is just the
uklidian norm but scaled by the

3264
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:13,520
uklidian norm but scaled by the
 

3265
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,629
uklidian norm but scaled by the
dimension. Okay.

3266
01:22:16,629 --> 01:22:16,639
dimension. Okay.
 

3267
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:19,350
dimension. Okay.
So if the RMS norm of this vector is

3268
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:19,360
So if the RMS norm of this vector is
 

3269
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,830
So if the RMS norm of this vector is
one, what does that mean? It's uklidian

3270
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:21,840
one, what does that mean? It's uklidian
 

3271
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,590
one, what does that mean? It's uklidian
norm is

3272
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:23,600
norm is
 

3273
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,590
norm is
it's just square root d1, right? If d1

3274
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:25,600
it's just square root d1, right? If d1
 

3275
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,870
it's just square root d1, right? If d1
is the dimension of this. So I can

3276
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:26,880
is the dimension of this. So I can
 

3277
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,669
is the dimension of this. So I can
rewrite this constraint as this.

3278
01:22:29,669 --> 01:22:29,679
rewrite this constraint as this.
 

3279
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,470
rewrite this constraint as this.
Similarly, if this vector is dimension

3280
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:32,480
Similarly, if this vector is dimension
 

3281
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:35,590
Similarly, if this vector is dimension
d2, I can rewrite this as just 1 /<unk>

3282
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:35,600
d2, I can rewrite this as just 1 /<unk>
 

3283
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:41,030
d2, I can rewrite this as just 1 /<unk>
d uh d2 times the uklidian norm of this.

3284
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:41,040
d uh d2 times the uklidian norm of this.
 

3285
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,870
d uh d2 times the uklidian norm of this.
These are just both constants. I can

3286
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:42,880
These are just both constants. I can
 

3287
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,390
These are just both constants. I can
pull them out of the optimization

3288
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:44,400
pull them out of the optimization
 

3289
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,189
pull them out of the optimization
problem and recover here something that

3290
01:22:47,189 --> 01:22:47,199
problem and recover here something that
 

3291
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,189
problem and recover here something that
is very familiar to us which is what is

3292
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:49,199
is very familiar to us which is what is
 

3293
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,350
is very familiar to us which is what is

>> The spectral norm right?

3304
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:02,880
>> The spectral norm right?
 

3305
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,590
>> The spectral norm right?
We started the lecture with this.

3306
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:05,600
We started the lecture with this.
 

3307
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,550
We started the lecture with this.
Okay, good.

3308
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:08,560
Okay, good.
 

3309
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,629
Okay, good.
So

3310
01:23:10,629 --> 01:23:10,639
So
 

3311
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:13,750
So
this RMS to RMS norm

3312
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:13,760
this RMS to RMS norm
 

3313
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,149
this RMS to RMS norm
is something that is just essentially a

3314
01:23:16,149 --> 01:23:16,159
is something that is just essentially a
 

3315
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:19,430
is something that is just essentially a
scaled version of the spectral norm. Why

3316
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:19,440
scaled version of the spectral norm. Why
 

3317
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,709
scaled version of the spectral norm. Why
do we like this? We like this because

3318
01:23:22,709 --> 01:23:22,719
do we like this? We like this because
 

3319
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:25,030
do we like this? We like this because
the spectral norm is familiar. We can do

3320
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:25,040
the spectral norm is familiar. We can do
 

3321
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,390
the spectral norm is familiar. We can do
lots of things with the spectral norm.

3322
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:26,400
lots of things with the spectral norm.
 

3323
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,910
lots of things with the spectral norm.
We have theorems about it. We understand

3324
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:27,920
We have theorems about it. We understand
 

3325
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,590
We have theorems about it. We understand
it. We know its connection to singular

3326
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:29,600
it. We know its connection to singular
 

3327
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,189
it. We know its connection to singular
values. We know how to work with it.

3328
01:23:33,189 --> 01:23:33,199
values. We know how to work with it.
 

3329
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:35,030
values. We know how to work with it.
The other thing about this is that it's

3330
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:35,040
The other thing about this is that it's
 

3331
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,629
The other thing about this is that it's
coming naturally. It's trying to

3332
01:23:36,629 --> 01:23:36,639
coming naturally. It's trying to
 

3333
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:40,070
coming naturally. It's trying to
naturally take in the architecture of

3334
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:40,080
naturally take in the architecture of
 

3335
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,310
naturally take in the architecture of
the network when thinking about the

3336
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:42,320
the network when thinking about the
 

3337
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,629
the network when thinking about the
norm, right? It's saying, well, if you

3338
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:44,639
norm, right? It's saying, well, if you
 

3339
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:45,990
norm, right? It's saying, well, if you
have a lot of things coming in, more

3340
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:46,000
have a lot of things coming in, more
 

3341
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,270
have a lot of things coming in, more
things going out, few things going in,

3342
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:49,280
things going out, few things going in,
 

3343
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,350
things going out, few things going in,
basically the dimensionality of this

3344
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:51,360
basically the dimensionality of this
 

3345
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,870
basically the dimensionality of this
matrix

3346
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:52,880
matrix
 

3347
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,550
matrix
is naturally showing up in the value of

3348
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:56,560
is naturally showing up in the value of
 

3349
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,629
is naturally showing up in the value of
this particular norm. And so what if you

3350
01:24:00,629 --> 01:24:00,639
this particular norm. And so what if you
 

3351
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:02,870
this particular norm. And so what if you
wanted to do something we're trying to

3352
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:02,880
wanted to do something we're trying to
 

3353
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,990
wanted to do something we're trying to
build an optimizer that does something

3354
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:06,000
build an optimizer that does something
 

3355
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,070
build an optimizer that does something
on a layerbylayer basis, right? So each

3356
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:10,080
on a layerbylayer basis, right? So each
 

3357
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,790
on a layerbylayer basis, right? So each
of these layers has different matrix

3358
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:12,800
of these layers has different matrix
 

3359
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,310
of these layers has different matrix
multiplications associated with them.

3360
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:16,320
multiplications associated with them.
 

3361
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,149
multiplications associated with them.
And if you wanted to have an optimizer

3362
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:18,159
And if you wanted to have an optimizer
 

3363
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:21,830
And if you wanted to have an optimizer
that does different things,

3364
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:21,840
that does different things,
 

3365
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,990
that does different things,
by thinking about the RMS norm, you're

3366
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,000
by thinking about the RMS norm, you're
 

3367
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,310
by thinking about the RMS norm, you're
naturally bringing in the geometry of

3368
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:28,320
naturally bringing in the geometry of
 

3369
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,430
naturally bringing in the geometry of
the layer or the structure of the layer

3370
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:31,440
the layer or the structure of the layer
 

3371
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,350
the layer or the structure of the layer
into the optimization problem. And by

3372
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:35,360
into the optimization problem. And by
 

3373
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,790
into the optimization problem. And by
doing this, you can maybe have reduce

3374
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:38,800
doing this, you can maybe have reduce
 

3375
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,030
doing this, you can maybe have reduce
your hyperparameter search, which is

3376
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:41,040
your hyperparameter search, which is
 

3377
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,149
your hyperparameter search, which is
kind of the heart of the issue, right?

3378
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:44,159
kind of the heart of the issue, right?
 

3379
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:47,830
kind of the heart of the issue, right?
If I can generate this natural scaling

3380
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:47,840
If I can generate this natural scaling
 

3381
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,629
If I can generate this natural scaling
that says here you should move in this

3382
01:24:50,629 --> 01:24:50,639
that says here you should move in this
 

3383
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,390
that says here you should move in this
units and here you should move at this

3384
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:52,400
units and here you should move at this
 

3385
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,910
units and here you should move at this
scale and here you should move at this

3386
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,920
scale and here you should move at this
 

3387
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,990
scale and here you should move at this
scale.

3388
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:56,000
scale.
 

3389
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,750
scale.
Then this problem when you have to

3390
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:57,760
Then this problem when you have to
 

3391
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,430
Then this problem when you have to
choose one learning rate but everything

3392
01:24:59,430 --> 01:24:59,440
choose one learning rate but everything
 

3393
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,950
choose one learning rate but everything
is operating at different scales

3394
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:02,960
is operating at different scales
 

3395
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,189
is operating at different scales
is it doesn't go away but it's being

3396
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:05,199
is it doesn't go away but it's being
 

3397
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:07,189
is it doesn't go away but it's being
mitigated.

3398
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:07,199
mitigated.
 

3399
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:09,669
mitigated.
And this norm allows you to naturally

3400
01:25:09,669 --> 01:25:09,679
And this norm allows you to naturally
 

3401
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,590
And this norm allows you to naturally
bring in the different scales at which

3402
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:11,600
bring in the different scales at which
 

3403
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,390
bring in the different scales at which
the different layers are operating

3404
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:14,400
the different layers are operating
 

3405
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:18,550
the different layers are operating
into the geometry of the optimizer.

3406
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:18,560
into the geometry of the optimizer.
 

3407
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,390
into the geometry of the optimizer.
Okay, is that that's what I'm trying to

3408
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:22,400
Okay, is that that's what I'm trying to
 

3409
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:25,350
Okay, is that that's what I'm trying to
illustrate here. We will continue this

3410
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:25,360
illustrate here. We will continue this
 

3411
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,750
illustrate here. We will continue this
in the next class and build on this

3412
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:27,760
in the next class and build on this
 

3413
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,189
in the next class and build on this
perspective to get us to uh the MUP and

3414
01:25:31,189 --> 01:25:31,199
perspective to get us to uh the MUP and
 

3415
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:33,990
perspective to get us to uh the MUP and
the muon optimizers. So that's it. See

3416
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:34,000
the muon optimizers. So that's it. See
 

3417
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,320
the muon optimizers. So that's it. See
you next class.
