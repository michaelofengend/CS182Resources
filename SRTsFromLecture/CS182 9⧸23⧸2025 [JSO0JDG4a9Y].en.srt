00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
So um today I'm going to talk about u
 

5
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,550
So um today I'm going to talk about u
muon which is the kind of final

6
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
muon which is the kind of final

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,470
muon which is the kind of final
optimizer in our optimizer journey and

8
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
optimizer in our optimizer journey and
 

9
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,470
optimizer in our optimizer journey and
talk about how the idea of

10
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
talk about how the idea of
 

11
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,030
talk about how the idea of
um architecture specific optimizers has

12
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
um architecture specific optimizers has
 

13
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,789
um architecture specific optimizers has
basically changed the landscape of

14
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
basically changed the landscape of
 

15
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,470
basically changed the landscape of
optimization and there's a whole new

16
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
optimization and there's a whole new
 

17
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,149
optimization and there's a whole new
world essentially of optimizers out

18
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
world essentially of optimizers out
 

19
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,190
world essentially of optimizers out
there but I promised last time that I

20
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
there but I promised last time that I
 

21
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,430
there but I promised last time that I
went a little fast at the end of the

22
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
went a little fast at the end of the
 

23
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,750
went a little fast at the end of the
discussion So, I'm gonna go over that

24
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
discussion So, I'm gonna go over that
 

25
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,830
discussion So, I'm gonna go over that
last bit one more time.

26
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
last bit one more time.
 

27
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,030
last bit one more time.
So, everyone remember what we talked

28
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
So, everyone remember what we talked
 

29
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,030
So, everyone remember what we talked
about from up?

30
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
about from up?
 

31
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,589

00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759
Okay, that's my one minute timer. What
 

61
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:39,270
Okay, that's my one minute timer. What
happened to my screen?

63
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,749

00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
>> Okay, great. Okay, now that you've
 

65
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,909
>> Okay, great. Okay, now that you've
remembered what we were trying to do,

66
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
remembered what we were trying to do,
 

67
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,230
remembered what we were trying to do,
the whole idea behind MUP is to think

68
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
the whole idea behind MUP is to think
 

69
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,909
the whole idea behind MUP is to think
about

70
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
about
 

71
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,790
about
training large networks is really hard.

72
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
training large networks is really hard.
 

73
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,950
training large networks is really hard.
One of the key challenges in doing this

74
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
One of the key challenges in doing this
 

75
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,270
One of the key challenges in doing this
is the hyperparameter search because

76
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
is the hyperparameter search because
 

77
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,590
is the hyperparameter search because
there's too many hyperparameters and we

78
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
there's too many hyperparameters and we
 

79
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,710
there's too many hyperparameters and we
really don't know how to go about

80
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
really don't know how to go about
 

81
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,310
really don't know how to go about
finding and identifying what these

82
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,320
finding and identifying what these
 

83
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,909
finding and identifying what these
hyperparameters are. Everyone remember

84
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
hyperparameters are. Everyone remember
 

85
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,909
hyperparameters are. Everyone remember
that? That was a challenging thing. It

86
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
that? That was a challenging thing. It
 

87
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,189
that? That was a challenging thing. It
cost lots of dollars to train the

88
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
cost lots of dollars to train the
 

89
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,790
cost lots of dollars to train the
network. You can't just do a search and

90
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,800
network. You can't just do a search and
 

91
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,510
network. You can't just do a search and
a scan for hyperparameters. Okay. So,

92
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
a scan for hyperparameters. Okay. So,
 

93
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,070
a scan for hyperparameters. Okay. So,
MUP basically gives a architecture

94
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080
MUP basically gives a architecture
 

95
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,909
MUP basically gives a architecture
specific way of saying well what can I

96
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
specific way of saying well what can I
 

97
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,390
specific way of saying well what can I
do to scale the hyperparameters from a

98
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
do to scale the hyperparameters from a
 

99
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,309
do to scale the hyperparameters from a
smaller proxy network to a larger target

100
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
smaller proxy network to a larger target
 

101
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,150
smaller proxy network to a larger target
network that I actually want to train.

102
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
network that I actually want to train.
 

103
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,230
network that I actually want to train.
So instead of doing my hypersparameter

104
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
So instead of doing my hypersparameter
 

105
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,629
So instead of doing my hypersparameter
sweep on this trillion parameter model,

106
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
sweep on this trillion parameter model,
 

107
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,309
sweep on this trillion parameter model,
I'm going to do it on a much smaller

108
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
I'm going to do it on a much smaller
 

109
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,189
I'm going to do it on a much smaller
model. And once I and I can use this

110
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
model. And once I and I can use this
 

111
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,189
model. And once I and I can use this
then I take the hyperparameters from the

112
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
then I take the hyperparameters from the
 

113
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,150
then I take the hyperparameters from the
smaller model and just directly use them

114
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
smaller model and just directly use them
 

115
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,150
smaller model and just directly use them
for the larger model. Okay, that was the

116
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
for the larger model. Okay, that was the
 

117
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,870
for the larger model. Okay, that was the
key idea behind MUP.

118
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
key idea behind MUP.
 

119
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,189
key idea behind MUP.
And what this what the part I want to

120
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
And what this what the part I want to
 

121
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,150
And what this what the part I want to
talk about now is giving you one more

122
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
talk about now is giving you one more
 

123
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,870
talk about now is giving you one more
level of intuition for where the

124
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
level of intuition for where the
 

125
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,950
level of intuition for where the
thinking about MUP comes from which

126
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
thinking about MUP comes from which
 

127
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,070
thinking about MUP comes from which
leads nicely into talking about uh muon

128
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
leads nicely into talking about uh muon
 

129
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,749
leads nicely into talking about uh muon
later on.

130
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:01,759
later on.
 

131
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,950
later on.
So this is following uh a paper by I

132
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
So this is following uh a paper by I
 

133
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,629
So this is following uh a paper by I
think I talked about uh Jeremy

134
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
think I talked about uh Jeremy
 

135
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,629
think I talked about uh Jeremy
Bernstein, James Simon and Greg Yang uh

136
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
Bernstein, James Simon and Greg Yang uh
 

137
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,870
Bernstein, James Simon and Greg Yang uh
called a spectral condition for feature

138
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
called a spectral condition for feature
 

139
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,950
called a spectral condition for feature
learning. And here they're talking about

140
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
learning. And here they're talking about
 

141
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,870
learning. And here they're talking about
this simplified linear algebraic

142
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
this simplified linear algebraic
 

143
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,189
this simplified linear algebraic
perspective that leads to the same

144
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
perspective that leads to the same
 

145
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,830
perspective that leads to the same
scaling laws as MUP even though the

146
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
scaling laws as MUP even though the
 

147
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,390
scaling laws as MUP even though the
original MUP paper used tensor algebra

148
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
original MUP paper used tensor algebra
 

149
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,870
original MUP paper used tensor algebra
and was far more complicated. So to

150
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
and was far more complicated. So to
 

151
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,990
and was far more complicated. So to
remind us of what this setup here is,

152
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
remind us of what this setup here is,
 

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,430
remind us of what this setup here is,
let's HL be some hidden layer. And

154
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
let's HL be some hidden layer. And
 

155
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,029
let's HL be some hidden layer. And
what's happening, we have some hidden

156
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
what's happening, we have some hidden
 

157
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,629
what's happening, we have some hidden
layer. It's going into a weight matrix

158
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
layer. It's going into a weight matrix
 

159
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,629
layer. It's going into a weight matrix
WL. You have a bias coming in here. Then

160
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
WL. You have a bias coming in here. Then
 

161
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,189
WL. You have a bias coming in here. Then
you have a nonlinearity here. And what

162
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
you have a nonlinearity here. And what
 

163
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,150
you have a nonlinearity here. And what
you get out is the next layer HL. This

164
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
you get out is the next layer HL. This
 

165
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,430
you get out is the next layer HL. This
is just what's happening at layer L.

166
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
is just what's happening at layer L.
 

167
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,790
is just what's happening at layer L.
Our matrix WL is D out by D in.

168
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
Our matrix WL is D out by D in.
 

169
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,710
Our matrix WL is D out by D in.
And what we want to do is now we want to

170
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
And what we want to do is now we want to
 

171
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,830
And what we want to do is now we want to
focus our attention on how our scaling

172
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
focus our attention on how our scaling
 

173
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,869
focus our attention on how our scaling
of these parameters should behave as the

174
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
of these parameters should behave as the
 

175
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,189
of these parameters should behave as the
network width scales because we want to

176
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
network width scales because we want to
 

177
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,430
network width scales because we want to
be able to transfer parameters from a

178
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
be able to transfer parameters from a
 

179
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,070
be able to transfer parameters from a
smaller network to a larger network.

180
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
smaller network to a larger network.
 

181
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,230
smaller network to a larger network.
Okay. So we're right now not thinking

182
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
Okay. So we're right now not thinking
 

183
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,469
Okay. So we're right now not thinking
about the depth of the network. We're

184
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
about the depth of the network. We're
 

185
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,670
about the depth of the network. We're
only thinking about the width. Okay.

186
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680

 

187
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,029

Now, we've talked about Xavier

188
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
Now, we've talked about Xavier
 

189
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,230
Now, we've talked about Xavier
initialization many times and we've come

190
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
initialization many times and we've come
 

191
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,309
initialization many times and we've come
to this conclusion that look we want to

192
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
to this conclusion that look we want to
 

193
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,270
to this conclusion that look we want to
have all of the entries of our layer be

194
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
have all of the entries of our layer be
 

195
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,350
have all of the entries of our layer be
approximately of the same order. We want

196
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
approximately of the same order. We want
 

197
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,949
approximately of the same order. We want
them to be for example approximately

198
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
them to be for example approximately
 

199
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,990
them to be for example approximately
one. And this led us to this condition

200
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
one. And this led us to this condition
 

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,350
one. And this led us to this condition
of the RMS norm being one. Right? And

202
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
of the RMS norm being one. Right? And
 

203
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,029
of the RMS norm being one. Right? And
the RMS norm talked about is a

204
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
the RMS norm talked about is a
 

205
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,149
the RMS norm talked about is a
relaxation of the idea that every single

206
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
relaxation of the idea that every single
 

207
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,710
relaxation of the idea that every single
entry should be approximately one. Okay?

208
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
entry should be approximately one. Okay?
 

209
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,389
entry should be approximately one. Okay?
Here we're saying that on this is

210
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
Here we're saying that on this is
 

211
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,829
Here we're saying that on this is
because the RMS norm is just taking the

212
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
because the RMS norm is just taking the
 

213
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,870
because the RMS norm is just taking the
average over the over the entries.

214
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
average over the over the entries.
 

215
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,790
average over the over the entries.
And remember that the RMS norm is just a

216
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
And remember that the RMS norm is just a
 

217
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,949
And remember that the RMS norm is just a
scaled version

218
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
scaled version
 

219
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,910
scaled version
of the two norm here. Our HL is now

220
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
of the two norm here. Our HL is now
 

221
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,070
of the two norm here. Our HL is now
dimension D out. So here we have the two

222
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
dimension D out. So here we have the two
 

223
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,509
dimension D out. So here we have the two
norm of this vector will be just square

224
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
norm of this vector will be just square
 

225
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,630
norm of this vector will be just square
root D out. Okay. If I assume if I want

226
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
root D out. Okay. If I assume if I want
 

227
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,269
root D out. Okay. If I assume if I want
to if I want to have the condition that

228
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
to if I want to have the condition that
 

229
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,750
to if I want to have the condition that
this hidden layer has RMS norm

230
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
this hidden layer has RMS norm
 

231
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,790
this hidden layer has RMS norm
approximately one or order one. Yeah,

232
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
approximately one or order one. Yeah,
 

233
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,470
approximately one or order one. Yeah,
RMS norm is coming back to everyone's

234
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
RMS norm is coming back to everyone's
 

235
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,150
RMS norm is coming back to everyone's
head.

236
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
head.
 

237
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,949
head.
Okay, good.

238
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
Okay, good.
 

239
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,790
Okay, good.
So this is one desired thing that we

240
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
So this is one desired thing that we
 

241
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,710
So this is one desired thing that we
want. And what's the other desired thing

242
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
want. And what's the other desired thing
 

243
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,110
want. And what's the other desired thing
that we want? We want to make sure that

244
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
that we want? We want to make sure that
 

245
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,509
that we want? We want to make sure that
our gradient descent or whatever

246
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
our gradient descent or whatever
 

247
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,509
our gradient descent or whatever
optimization we're doing is actually

248
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
optimization we're doing is actually
 

249
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,350
optimization we're doing is actually
moving our parameters, right? We don't

250
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
moving our parameters, right? We don't
 

251
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,949
moving our parameters, right? We don't
want to just be frozen in some

252
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
want to just be frozen in some
 

253
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,710
want to just be frozen in some
initialization and not really move

254
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
initialization and not really move
 

255
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,670
initialization and not really move
anywhere far from them, especially as

256
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
anywhere far from them, especially as
 

257
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,230
anywhere far from them, especially as
the width of your network increases,

258
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
the width of your network increases,
 

259
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,070
the width of your network increases,
right? So, you want to make sure that

260
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
right? So, you want to make sure that
 

261
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,790
right? So, you want to make sure that
your updates are not becoming negligible

262
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
your updates are not becoming negligible
 

263
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,470
your updates are not becoming negligible
as your network gets bigger and bigger.

264
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
as your network gets bigger and bigger.
 

265
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,670
as your network gets bigger and bigger.
I don't know what's wrong with this

266
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
I don't know what's wrong with this
 

267
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:20,150
I don't know what's wrong with this
projector today.

268
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160

 

269
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,509

It's like there's something loose

270
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
It's like there's something loose
 

271
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:31,430
It's like there's something loose
somewhere, but I can't figure out what.

272
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440

 

273
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,949

Okay. Hopefully this stays stablely.

274
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959

 

275
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,470

So for that I also want to look at

276
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
So for that I also want to look at
 

277
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,790
So for that I also want to look at
the update to my parameters as I'm

278
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
the update to my parameters as I'm
 

279
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,110
the update to my parameters as I'm
running my optimization algorithm. And I

280
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
running my optimization algorithm. And I
 

281
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,790
running my optimization algorithm. And I
want to make sure that the update to my

282
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:48,800
want to make sure that the update to my
 

283
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,269
want to make sure that the update to my
parameters is also approximately order

284
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,279
parameters is also approximately order
 

285
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,670
parameters is also approximately order
one in terms of the width. Of course

286
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
one in terms of the width. Of course
 

287
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,509
one in terms of the width. Of course
remember that your update is going to be

288
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
remember that your update is going to be
 

289
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,829
remember that your update is going to be
multiplied by your learning rate. Right?

290
00:10:59,829 --> 00:10:59,839
multiplied by your learning rate. Right?
 

291
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,030
multiplied by your learning rate. Right?
you have your gradient step and you

292
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
you have your gradient step and you
 

293
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,389
you have your gradient step and you
multiply it by your learning rate which

294
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
multiply it by your learning rate which
 

295
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,069
multiply it by your learning rate which
is small. So compared to

296
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
is small. So compared to
 

297
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,350
is small. So compared to
um your HL your delta HL is going to be

298
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
um your HL your delta HL is going to be
 

299
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,150
um your HL your delta HL is going to be
small but it's just not small in as a

300
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
small but it's just not small in as a
 

301
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,509
small but it's just not small in as a
function of the width right so as a

302
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
function of the width right so as a
 

303
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,550
function of the width right so as a
function of the width both of these are

304
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
function of the width both of these are
 

305
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,750
function of the width both of these are
order one that's the desired properties

306
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
order one that's the desired properties
 

307
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,790
order one that's the desired properties
that we want for us to be able to say

308
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
that we want for us to be able to say
 

309
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,790
that we want for us to be able to say
that we are having we are we are

310
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
that we are having we are we are
 

311
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,870
that we are having we are we are
learning features basically we don't

312
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
learning features basically we don't
 

313
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,990
learning features basically we don't
want to be stuck where we were

314
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
want to be stuck where we were
 

315
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,389
want to be stuck where we were
initialized and we want to make sure

316
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
initialized and we want to make sure
 

317
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,389
initialized and we want to make sure
that things are not becoming too big or

318
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
that things are not becoming too big or
 

319
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,069
that things are not becoming too big or
too

320
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
too
 

321
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,670
too
These desired properties seem reasonable

322
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
These desired properties seem reasonable
 

323
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,750
These desired properties seem reasonable
to everyone, right? That's what this

324
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
to everyone, right? That's what this
 

325
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,590
to everyone, right? That's what this
paper argues that these properties are

326
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
paper argues that these properties are
 

327
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,470
paper argues that these properties are
reasonable and desired. And now the

328
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
reasonable and desired. And now the
 

329
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,470
reasonable and desired. And now the
question is well, how can we achieve

330
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
question is well, how can we achieve
 

331
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,269
question is well, how can we achieve
this? What kind of scaling is going to

332
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
this? What kind of scaling is going to
 

333
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,509
this? What kind of scaling is going to
get us there?

334
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
get us there?
 

335
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,310
get us there?
So first let's just ignore the bias and

336
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
So first let's just ignore the bias and
 

337
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,069
So first let's just ignore the bias and
the nonlinearity.

338
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
the nonlinearity.
 

339
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,829
the nonlinearity.
And if we ignore the bias and the

340
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
And if we ignore the bias and the
 

341
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,590
And if we ignore the bias and the
nonlinearity,

342
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
nonlinearity,
 

343
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,829
nonlinearity,
we can say that HL is given by WL * HL

344
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
we can say that HL is given by WL * HL
 

345
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,230
we can say that HL is given by WL * HL
minus one.

346
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
minus one.
 

347
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,310
minus one.
Right? This is just what is what the

348
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
Right? This is just what is what the
 

349
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,110
Right? This is just what is what the
weight matrix is doing.

350
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
weight matrix is doing.
 

351
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,030
weight matrix is doing.
Now we want to understand basically how

352
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
Now we want to understand basically how
 

353
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,470
Now we want to understand basically how
things are evolving. We want to proceed

354
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
things are evolving. We want to proceed
 

355
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,550
things are evolving. We want to proceed
in an inductive manner. So if our

356
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
in an inductive manner. So if our
 

357
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,670
in an inductive manner. So if our
assumptions are satisfied for HL minus

358
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
assumptions are satisfied for HL minus
 

359
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,389
assumptions are satisfied for HL minus
one, we want to be able to say that

360
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
one, we want to be able to say that
 

361
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,110
one, we want to be able to say that
okay, if HL minus one has the update of

362
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
okay, if HL minus one has the update of
 

363
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,110
okay, if HL minus one has the update of
the right size and if it has a magnitude

364
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
the right size and if it has a magnitude
 

365
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,030
the right size and if it has a magnitude
of the right size, if the RMS norms are

366
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
of the right size, if the RMS norms are
 

367
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,590
of the right size, if the RMS norms are
correct at level H L minus one, then

368
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
correct at level H L minus one, then
 

369
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,269
correct at level H L minus one, then
they're going to be correct at level L.

370
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
they're going to be correct at level L.
 

371
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,710
they're going to be correct at level L.
And to understand this, I'm going to

372
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
And to understand this, I'm going to
 

373
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,310
And to understand this, I'm going to
look at this particular equation, see

374
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
look at this particular equation, see
 

375
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,509
look at this particular equation, see
how they're evolving with WL.

376
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
how they're evolving with WL.
 

377
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,389
how they're evolving with WL.
So to understand this there's one

378
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
So to understand this there's one
 

379
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,230
So to understand this there's one
there's abs exactly one norm that's

380
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
there's abs exactly one norm that's
 

381
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,509
there's abs exactly one norm that's
going to help us here right basically

382
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
going to help us here right basically
 

383
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,310
going to help us here right basically
I'm scaling this vector by this matrix

384
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
I'm scaling this vector by this matrix
 

385
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,150
I'm scaling this vector by this matrix
and what is the norm that tells us how

386
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
and what is the norm that tells us how
 

387
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,069
and what is the norm that tells us how
much a vector is scaled by a matrix

388
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
much a vector is scaled by a matrix
 

389
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,990
much a vector is scaled by a matrix
it's the spectral norm in general we can

390
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
it's the spectral norm in general we can
 

391
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,829
it's the spectral norm in general we can
think about any induced norm right

392
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
think about any induced norm right
 

393
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,990
think about any induced norm right
depending on which norms you're using

394
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
depending on which norms you're using
 

395
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,670
depending on which norms you're using
but if we wanted to think about the two

396
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
but if we wanted to think about the two
 

397
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,870
but if we wanted to think about the two
norms in both cases then I can think

398
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880
norms in both cases then I can think
 

399
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,230
norms in both cases then I can think
about the spectral norm of wl and the

400
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
about the spectral norm of wl and the
 

401
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,790
about the spectral norm of wl and the
two norm of hl minus one and thankfully

402
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
two norm of hl minus one and thankfully
 

403
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,389
two norm of hl minus one and thankfully
the RMS norm which is what we're

404
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
the RMS norm which is what we're
 

405
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,110
the RMS norm which is what we're
interested in is just a scaling on the

406
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
interested in is just a scaling on the
 

407
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,590
interested in is just a scaling on the
two norm right so this works out in our

408
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
two norm right so this works out in our
 

409
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,910
two norm right so this works out in our
interest

410
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
interest
 

411
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,470
interest
so in general when I look at how a

412
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
so in general when I look at how a
 

413
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,949
so in general when I look at how a
vector is scaled by a matrix well it

414
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
vector is scaled by a matrix well it
 

415
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,550
vector is scaled by a matrix well it
really depends on what direction that

416
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
really depends on what direction that
 

417
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,949
really depends on what direction that
vector is in right it depends on whether

418
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
vector is in right it depends on whether
 

419
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,310
vector is in right it depends on whether
this vector is aligned with the top

420
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
this vector is aligned with the top
 

421
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,069
this vector is aligned with the top
singular value or the middle singular

422
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
singular value or the middle singular
 

423
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,629
singular value or the middle singular
value or the small singular value or how

424
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
value or the small singular value or how
 

425
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,389
value or the small singular value or how
its components are distributed in all of

426
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
its components are distributed in all of
 

427
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,150
its components are distributed in all of
the singular value bases Right? So if I

428
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
the singular value bases Right? So if I
 

429
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,910
the singular value bases Right? So if I
want to get the maximum boost from a

430
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
want to get the maximum boost from a
 

431
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,310
want to get the maximum boost from a
particular matrix,

432
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
particular matrix,
 

433
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,910
particular matrix,
what direction do I want to be aligned

434
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
what direction do I want to be aligned
 

435
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,910
what direction do I want to be aligned
in?

436
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
in?
 

437
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,829
in?
>> The top singular vector. Right? And if I

438
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
>> The top singular vector. Right? And if I
 

439
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,430
>> The top singular vector. Right? And if I
want to have the minimum scaling, I want

440
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
want to have the minimum scaling, I want
 

441
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,910
want to have the minimum scaling, I want
to be aligned according to the smallest

442
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
to be aligned according to the smallest
 

443
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,509
to be aligned according to the smallest
singular vector. Okay?

444
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
singular vector. Okay?
 

445
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,590
singular vector. Okay?
So what this paper shows I'm not going

446
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
So what this paper shows I'm not going
 

447
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,030
So what this paper shows I'm not going
to go into the argument here but you can

448
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
to go into the argument here but you can
 

449
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,750
to go into the argument here but you can
show with not a particularly complicated

450
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
show with not a particularly complicated
 

451
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,629
show with not a particularly complicated
argument that

452
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
argument that
 

453
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,990
argument that
in general you will find that your

454
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
in general you will find that your
 

455
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,389
in general you will find that your
updates your your your hidden layers

456
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
updates your your your hidden layers
 

457
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,910
updates your your your hidden layers
will actually align with the larger

458
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
will actually align with the larger
 

459
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,910
will actually align with the larger
singular vector singular values of your

460
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
singular vector singular values of your
 

461
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,829
singular vector singular values of your
matrix. Okay. So if we assume this we

462
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
matrix. Okay. So if we assume this we
 

463
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,430
matrix. Okay. So if we assume this we
can write basically the following

464
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
can write basically the following
 

465
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,110
can write basically the following
equality which is that the two norm of

466
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
equality which is that the two norm of
 

467
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,509
equality which is that the two norm of
HL can be written as a product

468
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
HL can be written as a product
 

469
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,829
HL can be written as a product
approximately of the two norm of this

470
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
approximately of the two norm of this
 

471
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,550
approximately of the two norm of this
matrix WL and the two norm of this

472
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
matrix WL and the two norm of this
 

473
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,350
matrix WL and the two norm of this
matrix of this vector

474
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
matrix of this vector
 

475
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,750
matrix of this vector
HL minus one. Okay

476
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:45,760
HL minus one. Okay
 

477
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,590
HL minus one. Okay
just substituting in well I know that

478
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
just substituting in well I know that
 

479
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,310
just substituting in well I know that
this is approximately uh the two norm is

480
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
this is approximately uh the two norm is
 

481
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,110
this is approximately uh the two norm is
approximately order square root d out. I

482
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
approximately order square root d out. I
 

483
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,870
approximately order square root d out. I
know that the two norm here is

484
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
know that the two norm here is
 

485
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,230
know that the two norm here is
approximately square root D in because

486
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
approximately square root D in because
 

487
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,750
approximately square root D in because
we're assuming RMS norm one u for these

488
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
we're assuming RMS norm one u for these
 

489
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,230
we're assuming RMS norm one u for these
things and so if I want this to be RMS

490
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
things and so if I want this to be RMS
 

491
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,670
things and so if I want this to be RMS
norm one basically I want this to be

492
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
norm one basically I want this to be
 

493
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,230
norm one basically I want this to be
approximately square root D out that

494
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
approximately square root D out that
 

495
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,990
approximately square root D out that
gives me this condition on

496
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
gives me this condition on
 

497
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,750
gives me this condition on
the RMS to RMS in or the uh the spectral

498
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760
the RMS to RMS in or the uh the spectral
 

499
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,790
the RMS to RMS in or the uh the spectral
norm of WL that it should be basically

500
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
norm of WL that it should be basically
 

501
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,629
norm of WL that it should be basically
square root D out by DN right just

502
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
square root D out by DN right just
 

503
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,030
square root D out by DN right just
division gives me that okay And this is

504
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
division gives me that okay And this is
 

505
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,389
division gives me that okay And this is
basically the same as saying that oh

506
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
basically the same as saying that oh
 

507
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,829
basically the same as saying that oh
this is the RMS tors induced norm is

508
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
this is the RMS tors induced norm is
 

509
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,069
this is the RMS tors induced norm is
basically order one right this is the

510
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
basically order one right this is the
 

511
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,790
basically order one right this is the
same thing and that's exactly what we

512
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
same thing and that's exactly what we
 

513
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,949
same thing and that's exactly what we
started with right we started with

514
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
started with right we started with
 

515
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,069
started with right we started with
saying that oh we want to have the RMS

516
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
saying that oh we want to have the RMS
 

517
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,870
saying that oh we want to have the RMS
to RMS induced norm of this uh weight

518
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
to RMS induced norm of this uh weight
 

519
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,949
to RMS induced norm of this uh weight
matrix to be uh order one

520
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
matrix to be uh order one
 

521
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,150
matrix to be uh order one
that's what we talked about when we

522
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
that's what we talked about when we
 

523
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,670
that's what we talked about when we
derived when we did that whole

524
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
derived when we did that whole
 

525
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,629
derived when we did that whole
derivation of mu last time so this is

526
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
derivation of mu last time so this is
 

527
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,790
derivation of mu last time so this is
justifying basically one other way of

528
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
justifying basically one other way of
 

529
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,430
justifying basically one other way of
thinking about where that uh condition

530
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
thinking about where that uh condition
 

531
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,710
thinking about where that uh condition
is coming from and why that's a

532
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
is coming from and why that's a
 

533
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,069
is coming from and why that's a
reasonable thing to think about why

534
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,079
reasonable thing to think about why
 

535
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,350
reasonable thing to think about why
that's a good thing to think about.

536
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
that's a good thing to think about.
 

537
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,269
that's a good thing to think about.
Okay, good. Then the other thing we want

538
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
Okay, good. Then the other thing we want
 

539
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,550
Okay, good. Then the other thing we want
to talk about or the other thing we want

540
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
to talk about or the other thing we want
 

541
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,710
to talk about or the other thing we want
to look at at in this desired properties

542
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
to look at at in this desired properties
 

543
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,550
to look at at in this desired properties
is we also said we care about the size

544
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
is we also said we care about the size
 

545
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,110
is we also said we care about the size
of the update. We don't

546
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120

 

547
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,550

so you want to make sure that the

548
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
so you want to make sure that the
 

549
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,870
so you want to make sure that the
updates are not too small or too big.

550
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
updates are not too small or too big.
 

551
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,310
updates are not too small or too big.
Let's actually look at this here.

552
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,320
Let's actually look at this here.
 

553
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,710
Let's actually look at this here.
So here what I have

554
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
So here what I have
 

555
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,310
So here what I have
is again I have HL is equal to WL * HL

556
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
is again I have HL is equal to WL * HL
 

557
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,430
is again I have HL is equal to WL * HL
minus one. And therefore I can write the

558
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
minus one. And therefore I can write the
 

559
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,150
minus one. And therefore I can write the
update also as a linear function given

560
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
update also as a linear function given
 

561
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,550
update also as a linear function given
this. So I can write the update of HL is

562
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
this. So I can write the update of HL is
 

563
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,749
this. So I can write the update of HL is
the update in W * HL minus one plus W *

564
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
the update in W * HL minus one plus W *
 

565
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,389
the update in W * HL minus one plus W *
the update in HL minus one. Yeah,

566
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
the update in HL minus one. Yeah,
 

567
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,350
the update in HL minus one. Yeah,
everyone with me till there.

568
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
everyone with me till there.
 

569
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,269
everyone with me till there.
Now, I'll give you a minute to say,

570
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
Now, I'll give you a minute to say,
 

571
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,030
Now, I'll give you a minute to say,
okay, can you inductively argue what

572
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
okay, can you inductively argue what
 

573
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,069
okay, can you inductively argue what
other condition you might need to be

574
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
other condition you might need to be
 

575
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,110
other condition you might need to be
able to make sure that your

576
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
able to make sure that your
 

577
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,749
able to make sure that your
delta HL update is also RMS order one.

578
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759
delta HL update is also RMS order one.
 

579
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,350
delta HL update is also RMS order one.
Okay, so remember what you have is that

580
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:07,360
Okay, so remember what you have is that
 

581
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,710
Okay, so remember what you have is that
you already have some condition on WL

582
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
you already have some condition on WL
 

583
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,549
you already have some condition on WL
which you've have here. You're

584
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
which you've have here. You're
 

585
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,949
which you've have here. You're
inductively assuming a condition here

586
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
inductively assuming a condition here
 

587
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,829
inductively assuming a condition here
and now you want to get

588
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:19,839
and now you want to get
 

589
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,669
and now you want to get
this desired property. Okay. So using

590
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
this desired property. Okay. So using
 

591
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,429
this desired property. Okay. So using
this, can you try to work this out for

592
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
this, can you try to work this out for
 

593
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,350
this, can you try to work this out for
on your own just for one minute? Try to

594
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
on your own just for one minute? Try to
 

595
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,110
on your own just for one minute? Try to
take a minute to to see what this might

596
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
take a minute to to see what this might
 

597
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,990
take a minute to to see what this might
be

598
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
be
 

599
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,909
be
and talk to each other.

600
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919

 

601
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,750

Also a good way to check that you're

602
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
Also a good way to check that you're
 

603
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,789
Also a good way to check that you're
following along and that you're on

604
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
following along and that you're on
 

605
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,750
following along and that you're on
track. If you're confused about

606
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
track. If you're confused about
 

607
00:17:39,760 --> 00:18:04,630
track. If you're confused about
something, ask me a question.

608
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640

 

609
00:18:04,640 --> 00:19:37,430

I'm trying to see

610
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:37,440

 

611
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,510

Okay, there's my timer. Does anybody

612
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
Okay, there's my timer. Does anybody
 

613
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,789
Okay, there's my timer. Does anybody
have any questions? I feel like people

614
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
have any questions? I feel like people
 

615
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,430
have any questions? I feel like people
are a little bit lost.

616
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
are a little bit lost.
 

617
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,549
are a little bit lost.
>> Yes.

618
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
>> Yes.
 

619
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,510
>> Yes.
>> So, I know you made the assumption that

>> So, I know you made the assumption that
 

621
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,750
>> So, I know you made the assumption that
But I'm a little confused why we're able

622
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760
But I'm a little confused why we're able
 

623
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,270
But I'm a little confused why we're able
to make that equality for the norm if it

624
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
to make that equality for the norm if it
 

625
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,870
to make that equality for the norm if it
doesn't like where does that come from?

626
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:54,880
doesn't like where does that come from?
 

627
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,270
doesn't like where does that come from?
>> Okay, so where did this come from? It's

628
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,280
>> Okay, so where did this come from? It's
 

629
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,830
>> Okay, so where did this come from? It's
a great question. I'm not proving this

630
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840
a great question. I'm not proving this
 

631
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,590
a great question. I'm not proving this
to you. This requires proof.

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,630
definition of the spectral norm. So
basically what is the spectral norm? The

644
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
basically what is the spectral norm? The
 

645
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,630
basically what is the spectral norm? The
spectral norm is the value the magnitude

646
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
spectral norm is the value the magnitude
 

647
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,630
spectral norm is the value the magnitude
of the largest singular value.

648
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:16,640
of the largest singular value.
 

649
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,310
of the largest singular value.
>> Right? And so if I have a vector that is

650
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,320
>> Right? And so if I have a vector that is
 

651
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,230
>> Right? And so if I have a vector that is
perfectly aligned to the top singular

652
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
perfectly aligned to the top singular
 

653
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,830
perfectly aligned to the top singular
vector,

654
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
vector,
 

655
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,909
vector,
what is it's it's going to be orthogonal

656
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
what is it's it's going to be orthogonal
 

657
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,430
what is it's it's going to be orthogonal
to all the other singular directions. So

658
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,440
to all the other singular directions. So
 

659
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,710
to all the other singular directions. So
the only singular value it's going to be

660
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
the only singular value it's going to be
 

661
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,149
the only singular value it's going to be
multiplied by is the largest singular

662
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:30,159
multiplied by is the largest singular
 

663
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,430
multiplied by is the largest singular
value.

664
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:33,440

 

665
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,870

So if hl minus one is only in the

666
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:36,880
So if hl minus one is only in the
 

667
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,029
So if hl minus one is only in the
direction of the largest singular

668
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,039
direction of the largest singular
 

669
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,190
direction of the largest singular
vector, it will have zero components

670
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:41,200
vector, it will have zero components
 

671
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,710
vector, it will have zero components
everywhere else. And so the only thing

672
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
everywhere else. And so the only thing
 

673
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,350
everywhere else. And so the only thing
it'll be scaled by is sigma one which is

674
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,360
it'll be scaled by is sigma one which is
 

675
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,430
it'll be scaled by is sigma one which is
the largest singular value.

676
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440

 

677
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:51,909

>> Yes.

678
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:51,919
>> Yes.
 

679
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,310
>> Yes.
>> Here we're taking for granted that h is

680
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
>> Here we're taking for granted that h is
 

681
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,909
>> Here we're taking for granted that h is
will be aligned.

682
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
will be aligned.
 

683
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,070
will be aligned.
>> Yes, we're taking for granted. This

684
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
>> Yes, we're taking for granted. This
 

685
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,190
>> Yes, we're taking for granted. This
requires proof. They prove it. It's not

686
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,200
requires proof. They prove it. It's not
 

687
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,270
requires proof. They prove it. It's not
that hard to do but it's not worth all

688
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,280
that hard to do but it's not worth all
 

689
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,230
that hard to do but it's not worth all
of us spending u it would take a quite a

690
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
of us spending u it would take a quite a
 

691
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,430
of us spending u it would take a quite a
bit of the lecture and I'm not sure it's

692
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
bit of the lecture and I'm not sure it's
 

693
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,070
bit of the lecture and I'm not sure it's
worth going into uh the arguments.

694
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,080
worth going into uh the arguments.
 

695
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,830
worth going into uh the arguments.
Basically, it's a it's a concentration

696
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
Basically, it's a it's a concentration
 

697
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,669
Basically, it's a it's a concentration
argument.

698
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
argument.
 

699
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:24,390
argument.
Yes.

700
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400

 

701
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,190

And that's

702
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:25,200
And that's
 

703
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,470
And that's
>> this equation.

704
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
>> this equation.
 

705
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,310
>> this equation.
>> Yeah.

706
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
>> Yeah.
 

707
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,390
>> Yeah.
>> This is just how you differentiate,

708
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
>> This is just how you differentiate,
 

709
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,630
>> This is just how you differentiate,
right? It's just the same uh it's the

710
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
right? It's just the same uh it's the
 

711
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,149
right? It's just the same uh it's the
same rule.

712
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:34,159
same rule.
 

713
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,430
same rule.
>> Yeah. So basically like when we are

714
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
>> Yeah. So basically like when we are
 

715
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,029
>> Yeah. So basically like when we are
training our network both W and HL are

716
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
training our network both W and HL are
 

717
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,950

changing

718
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:44,960

 

719
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,710

>> when you're training your network both

>> when you're training your network both
 

721
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,310

because they're getting updated right?
 

729
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,190
because they're getting updated right?
So whenever I want to see what is the

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
So whenever I want to see what is the
 

731

Other questions?

746
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:23,919

 

747
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,310

Okay, good. So once you have this, what

748
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
Okay, good. So once you have this, what
 

749
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,990
Okay, good. So once you have this, what
can you say

750
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000

 

751
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,669

here? I can just write this out again if

752
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
here? I can just write this out again if
 

753
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:40,630
here? I can just write this out again if
that will maybe be helpful.

754
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:40,640

 

755
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:49,270

So I have this, right?

756
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280

 

757
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,870

Okay,

758
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
Okay,
 

759
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,430
Okay,
if I have this now and I want to look at

760
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
if I have this now and I want to look at
 

761
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,110
if I have this now and I want to look at
how

762
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
how
 

763
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,070
how
the norm of this evolves,

764
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
the norm of this evolves,
 

765
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,070
the norm of this evolves,
well, I want to basically look at it in

766
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
well, I want to basically look at it in
 

767
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,789
well, I want to basically look at it in
terms of

768
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:04,799
terms of
 

769
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,950
terms of
the norm of this, right? The two norm of

770
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
the norm of this, right? The two norm of
 

771
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,950
the norm of this, right? The two norm of
this. So, what are the properties of?

772
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
this. So, what are the properties of?
 

773
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,549
this. So, what are the properties of?
So, this is now a norm. So I want to

774
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
So, this is now a norm. So I want to
 

775
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,470
So, this is now a norm. So I want to
look at So is everyone does everyone

776
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:12,480
look at So is everyone does everyone
 

777
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:33,750
look at So is everyone does everyone
believe me here that

778
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:33,760

 

779
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,350

this I can write clearly the two things

780
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
this I can write clearly the two things
 

781
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,029
this I can write clearly the two things
are equal. I can just take norms on both

782
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:37,039
are equal. I can just take norms on both
 

783
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,950
are equal. I can just take norms on both
sides. Okay. Well, now I can apply a the

784
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:40,960
sides. Okay. Well, now I can apply a the
 

785
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,950
sides. Okay. Well, now I can apply a the
triangle inequality.

786
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
triangle inequality.
 

787
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,190
triangle inequality.
Okay.

788
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,200
Okay.
 

789
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,270
Okay.
And b I can then use basically the sub

790
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:49,280
And b I can then use basically the sub
 

791
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,430
And b I can then use basically the sub
additivity or the sub multiplicative

792
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
additivity or the sub multiplicative
 

793
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,669
additivity or the sub multiplicative
property of the spectral norm and spect

794
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679
property of the spectral norm and spect
 

795
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,149
property of the spectral norm and spect
separate these out individually. So I'm

796
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
separate these out individually. So I'm
 

797
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,230
separate these out individually. So I'm
going to get

798
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240

 

799
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:26,630

this to be

800
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640

 

801
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,710

Okay. So here I'm applying triangle

802
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
Okay. So here I'm applying triangle
 

803
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:37,590
Okay. So here I'm applying triangle
inequality

804
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600

 

805
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,549

plus basically

806
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
plus basically
 

807
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:53,750
plus basically
um

808
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760

 

809
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,510

so I'm bounding this by sub

810
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
so I'm bounding this by sub
 

811
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,070
so I'm bounding this by sub
multiplicative all I mean is that this

812
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,080
multiplicative all I mean is that this
 

813
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,070
multiplicative all I mean is that this
norm I'm replacing with this.

814
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
norm I'm replacing with this.
 

815
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,310
norm I'm replacing with this.
Okay.

816
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320

 

817
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,590

So here I want to ignore I want to I'm

818
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,600
So here I want to ignore I want to I'm
 

819
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,310
So here I want to ignore I want to I'm
I'm I'm going to handwave a little bit

820
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
I'm I'm going to handwave a little bit
 

821
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,549
I'm I'm going to handwave a little bit
to say that I want to say that these are

822
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
to say that I want to say that these are
 

823
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,549
to say that I want to say that these are
approximately going to be the same in

824
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:16,559
approximately going to be the same in
 

825
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,430
approximately going to be the same in
terms of order. Okay, these are not

826
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,440
terms of order. Okay, these are not
 

827
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,830
terms of order. Okay, these are not
going to be much bigger or much smaller.

828
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
going to be much bigger or much smaller.
 

829
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,990
going to be much bigger or much smaller.
I'm only making arguments at the order

830
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm only making arguments at the order
 

831
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,669
I'm only making arguments at the order
level. And so here this inequality I'm

832
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
level. And so here this inequality I'm
 

833
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,190
level. And so here this inequality I'm
basically I want to ignore this. Yes,

834
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
basically I want to ignore this. Yes,
 

835
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,710
basically I want to ignore this. Yes,
the triangle inequality gives us an

836
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
the triangle inequality gives us an
 

837
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,630
the triangle inequality gives us an
inequality. Yes, we're making this

838
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
inequality. Yes, we're making this
 

839
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,470
inequality. Yes, we're making this
assumption that we're aligned in the

840
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
assumption that we're aligned in the
 

841
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,470
assumption that we're aligned in the
direction of the top singular vector to

842
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
direction of the top singular vector to
 

843
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,909
direction of the top singular vector to
be able to replace this with this.

844
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:39,919
be able to replace this with this.
 

845
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,909
be able to replace this with this.
And I want to hand like openly handwave

846
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:43,919
And I want to hand like openly handwave
 

847
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,990
And I want to hand like openly handwave
that away. I'm not doing that proof.

848
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,000
that away. I'm not doing that proof.
 

849
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,310
that away. I'm not doing that proof.
It's not worth to spend the time in

850
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,320
It's not worth to spend the time in
 

851
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,630
It's not worth to spend the time in
class to do that.

852
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
class to do that.
 

853
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,510
class to do that.
But what I want you to see is that this

854
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
But what I want you to see is that this
 

855
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,070
But what I want you to see is that this
is basically approximately what I get.

856
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,080
is basically approximately what I get.
 

857
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,510
is basically approximately what I get.
And now I can think about the size of

858
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
And now I can think about the size of
 

859
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,110
And now I can think about the size of
this update in terms of each of these

860
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
this update in terms of each of these
 

861
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,029
this update in terms of each of these
individual things.

862
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
individual things.
 

863
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,149
individual things.
>> Yes. Question.

864
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:06,159
>> Yes. Question.
 

865
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,630
>> Yes. Question.
>> Is it a given that the norm of delta

866
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:10,640
>> Is it a given that the norm of delta
 

867
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,990
>> Is it a given that the norm of delta
will be the same as?

868
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,000
will be the same as?
 

869
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,590
will be the same as?
>> It is not a given. That's exactly what I

870
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
>> It is not a given. That's exactly what I
 

871
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,990
>> It is not a given. That's exactly what I
want to derive.

872
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,000
want to derive.
 

873
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,230
want to derive.
That's exactly what I want to get to. So

874
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,240
That's exactly what I want to get to. So
 

875
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,590
That's exactly what I want to get to. So
maybe I should write this as here

876
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:23,600
maybe I should write this as here
 

877
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:33,830
maybe I should write this as here
question mark.

878
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:33,840

 

879
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,470

So if I want to be able to say that

880
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
So if I want to be able to say that
 

881
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,590
So if I want to be able to say that
this has a particular order, I want to

882
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
this has a particular order, I want to
 

883
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,750
this has a particular order, I want to
be able to give conditions. I want to I

884
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
be able to give conditions. I want to I
 

885
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,110
be able to give conditions. I want to I
want to say things about all of these.

886
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,120
want to say things about all of these.
 

887
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,350
want to say things about all of these.
And basically if I can assume certain

888
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,360
And basically if I can assume certain
 

889
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,950
And basically if I can assume certain
conditions then I can infer what the RMS

890
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
conditions then I can infer what the RMS
 

891
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,430
conditions then I can infer what the RMS
norm or the spectral norm of uh not the

892
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,440
norm or the spectral norm of uh not the
 

893
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,830
norm or the spectral norm of uh not the
spectral norm but the true norm of delta

894
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:55,840
spectral norm but the true norm of delta
 

895
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,230
spectral norm but the true norm of delta
HL will be.

896
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,240
HL will be.
 

897
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,390
HL will be.
Does that make sense?

898
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
Does that make sense?
 

899
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,750
Does that make sense?
Okay. I feel like you're still not with

900
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
Okay. I feel like you're still not with
 

901
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,310
Okay. I feel like you're still not with
me. So ask me questions. I don't quite

902
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
me. So ask me questions. I don't quite
 

903
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,630
me. So ask me questions. I don't quite
understand what the confusion is. So if

904
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:06,640
understand what the confusion is. So if
 

905
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,909
understand what the confusion is. So if
you ask me questions I can try to

906
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:07,919
you ask me questions I can try to
 

907
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,590
you ask me questions I can try to
resolve it.

908
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600

 

909
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:23,350

>> Yes.

910
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,360

 

911
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,990

Okay, that's totally fair. Um, I'm

912
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,000
Okay, that's totally fair. Um, I'm
 

913
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,710
Okay, that's totally fair. Um, I'm
trying to make a rough argument for how

914
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
trying to make a rough argument for how
 

915
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,630
trying to make a rough argument for how
the orders of magnitudes of these things

916
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,640
the orders of magnitudes of these things
 

917
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,950
the orders of magnitudes of these things
are going to evolve. So, I want to say

918
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
are going to evolve. So, I want to say
 

919
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,070
are going to evolve. So, I want to say
look, I know that this vector delta HL

920
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,080
look, I know that this vector delta HL
 

921
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,630
look, I know that this vector delta HL
is the sum of these two vectors. And so

922
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
is the sum of these two vectors. And so
 

923
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,149
is the sum of these two vectors. And so
I'm going to say that approximately

924
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
I'm going to say that approximately
 

925
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,590
I'm going to say that approximately
I can replace them with these other two

926
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,600
I can replace them with these other two
 

927
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,350
I can replace them with these other two
this this sum the norm of these sums.

928
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
this this sum the norm of these sums.
 

929
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,909
this this sum the norm of these sums.
It's not the same. If you read the paper

930
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:49,919
It's not the same. If you read the paper
 

931
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,590
It's not the same. If you read the paper
there's a rigorous proof of both the

932
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:51,600
there's a rigorous proof of both the
 

933
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,269
there's a rigorous proof of both the
upper bound and the lower there's a

934
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:53,279
upper bound and the lower there's a
 

935
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,710
upper bound and the lower there's a
there's a proof of both the upper bound

936
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:54,720
there's a proof of both the upper bound
 

937
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,870
there's a proof of both the upper bound
and the lower bound. We're not going

938
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:56,880
and the lower bound. We're not going
 

939
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,750
and the lower bound. We're not going
into it. I'm

940
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
into it. I'm
 

941
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,909
into it. I'm
>> this is in the paper. Yes. But we're not

942
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:01,919
>> this is in the paper. Yes. But we're not
 

943
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:15,430
>> this is in the paper. Yes. But we're not
we're not we're not going into this.

944
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440

 

945
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,190

Okay.

946
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,200
Okay.
 

947
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,470
Okay.
So I can inductively say if this is RMS

948
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:20,480
So I can inductively say if this is RMS
 

949
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,909
So I can inductively say if this is RMS
norm one then this is order square root

950
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:23,919
norm one then this is order square root
 

951
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,230
norm one then this is order square root
dn.

952
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,240
dn.
 

953
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,350
dn.
This is also order square root dn. this

954
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,360
This is also order square root dn. this
 

955
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,070
This is also order square root dn. this
I've derived a condition earlier and I

956
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
I've derived a condition earlier and I
 

957
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,269
I've derived a condition earlier and I
want this to be order square root d out

958
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:35,279
want this to be order square root d out
 

959
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,870
want this to be order square root d out
over dn. So that leaves this question

960
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
over dn. So that leaves this question
 

961
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,230
over dn. So that leaves this question
mark box over here for this to be RMS

962
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,240
mark box over here for this to be RMS
 

963
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,789
mark box over here for this to be RMS
norm one. I want the two norm of it to

964
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,799
norm one. I want the two norm of it to
 

965
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,430
norm one. I want the two norm of it to
be square root dout. So what should this

966
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
be square root dout. So what should this
 

967
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,470
be square root dout. So what should this
box be?

968
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:50,480
box be?
 

969
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,149
box be?
I basically want it to be the same as

970
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
I basically want it to be the same as
 

971
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,950
I basically want it to be the same as
this, right?

972
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
this, right?
 

973
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,190
this, right?
So that's where I get these two

974
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,200
So that's where I get these two
 

975
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,750
So that's where I get these two
conditions that I want the RMS norm to

976
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
conditions that I want the RMS norm to
 

977
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,269
conditions that I want the RMS norm to
be order one uh and the RMS norm of the

978
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:03,279
be order one uh and the RMS norm of the
 

979
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,510
be order one uh and the RMS norm of the
update also to be order one. So we

980
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:05,520
update also to be order one. So we
 

981
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,870
update also to be order one. So we
cannot assume this. What I'm trying to

982
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:06,880
cannot assume this. What I'm trying to
 

983
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,510
cannot assume this. What I'm trying to
get at is that these two conditions are

984
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,520
get at is that these two conditions are
 

985
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,190
get at is that these two conditions are
what we need to be able to guarantee

986
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,200
what we need to be able to guarantee
 

987
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,070
what we need to be able to guarantee
these two desired properties.

988
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080

 

989
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,510

Everyone with me? This? Yes. Question.

990
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,520

 

991
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,830

>> Um order means that I'm looking at how

992
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:25,840
>> Um order means that I'm looking at how
 

993
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,029
>> Um order means that I'm looking at how
this is scaling with the width. So it's

994
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:29,039
this is scaling with the width. So it's
 

995
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,669
this is scaling with the width. So it's
scaling as for example um

996
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:33,679
scaling as for example um
 

997
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,750
scaling as for example um
it's the RMS norm is scaling with the

998
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:35,760
it's the RMS norm is scaling with the
 

999
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,590
it's the RMS norm is scaling with the
width is what this is saying basically

1000
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600
width is what this is saying basically
 

1001
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:52,549
width is what this is saying basically
>> like

1002
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:52,559

 

1003
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,149

yes So that becomes square.

1004
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
yes So that becomes square.
 

1005
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,190
yes So that becomes square.
>> Yes.

1006
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200

 

1007
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,669

>> Uh no it's it's scaling as square root d

1008
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
>> Uh no it's it's scaling as square root d
 

1009
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:12,230
>> Uh no it's it's scaling as square root d
out with the width.

1010
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240

 

1011
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:22,549

>> Yes. I was connect.

1012
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559

 

1013
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,909

>> Yes.

1014
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:23,919
>> Yes.
 

1015
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:30,149
>> Yes.
>> Yes. Question.

1016
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:30,159

 

1017
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,669

>> Yes, you also have to lower bound it.

1018
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:31,679
>> Yes, you also have to lower bound it.
 

1019
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,470
>> Yes, you also have to lower bound it.
And I'm not doing that.

1020
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,480
And I'm not doing that.
 

1021
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,990
And I'm not doing that.
>> Yes. Yes.

1022
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
>> Yes. Yes.
 

1023
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,230
>> Yes. Yes.
>> Yes.

1024
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240

 

1025
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,830

We're saying we're all I'm okay I'm

1026
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:43,840
We're saying we're all I'm okay I'm
 

1027
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,750
We're saying we're all I'm okay I'm
making a huristic argument here. I'm not

1028
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:45,760
making a huristic argument here. I'm not
 

1029
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,630
making a huristic argument here. I'm not
proving anything. Okay, I'm making a

1030
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:48,640
proving anything. Okay, I'm making a
 

1031
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,950
proving anything. Okay, I'm making a
rough argument here. What I'm trying to

1032
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:50,960
rough argument here. What I'm trying to
 

1033
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,070
rough argument here. What I'm trying to
say is that if I want to make some

1034
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,080
say is that if I want to make some
 

1035
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,029
say is that if I want to make some
guarantees on how the update of the elf

1036
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:57,039
guarantees on how the update of the elf
 

1037
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,510
guarantees on how the update of the elf
layer behaves, I will have to make

1038
00:30:59,510 --> 00:30:59,520
layer behaves, I will have to make
 

1039
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,269
layer behaves, I will have to make
assumptions or I will have to have

1040
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:01,279
assumptions or I will have to have
 

1041
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,830
assumptions or I will have to have
conditions on both how the weight matrix

1042
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
conditions on both how the weight matrix
 

1043
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,830
conditions on both how the weight matrix
itself behaves

1044
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:07,840
itself behaves
 

1045
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,070
itself behaves
as well as how the update to the weight

1046
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,080
as well as how the update to the weight
 

1047
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:27,029
as well as how the update to the weight
matrix behaves. Okay.

1048
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:27,039

 

1049
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,230

So I'm saying that

1050
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,240
So I'm saying that
 

1051
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,389
So I'm saying that
I've already kind of said that I want to

1052
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
I've already kind of said that I want to
 

1053
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,149
I've already kind of said that I want to
get I want this condition. I've already

1054
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
get I want this condition. I've already
 

1055
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,470
get I want this condition. I've already
claimed that I want this condition.

1056
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
claimed that I want this condition.
 

1057
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,710
claimed that I want this condition.
These two I'm assuming inductively

1058
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:38,720
These two I'm assuming inductively
 

1059
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,430
These two I'm assuming inductively
follow. And so I'm saying what condition

1060
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
follow. And so I'm saying what condition
 

1061
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,830
follow. And so I'm saying what condition
do I need here to be able to get that

1062
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:45,840
do I need here to be able to get that
 

1063
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,029
do I need here to be able to get that
this will be RMS norm one.

1064
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:49,039
this will be RMS norm one.
 

1065
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,389
this will be RMS norm one.
Does that make sense?

1066
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:52,399
Does that make sense?
 

1067
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,430
Does that make sense?
That's all I'm saying. And there is I'm

1068
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
That's all I'm saying. And there is I'm
 

1069
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,710
That's all I'm saying. And there is I'm
making a rough rough sketch for why this

1070
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
making a rough rough sketch for why this
 

1071
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,549
making a rough rough sketch for why this
is true. Why why something like this

1072
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:00,559
is true. Why why something like this
 

1073
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,070
is true. Why why something like this
could be true. This is not a rigorous

1074
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,080
could be true. This is not a rigorous
 

1075
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,110
could be true. This is not a rigorous
proof.

1076
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
proof.
 

1077
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,310
proof.
>> Yes.

1078
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320

 

1079
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:17,350

Does that mean

1080
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360

 

1081
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,110

nothing here is

1082
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,120

 

1083
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,669

>> I mean if you look at the RMS norm it is

1084
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:23,679
>> I mean if you look at the RMS norm it is
 

1085
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,509
>> I mean if you look at the RMS norm it is
order one if you're looking at the two

1086
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:25,519

1087
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,269

1088

>> yes

1092
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:31,679
>> yes
 

1093
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,710
>> yes
>> um so uh is the norm of the

1094
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:36,720
>> um so uh is the norm of the
 

1095
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:45,990
>> um so uh is the norm of the
Hus.

1096
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,000

 

1097
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,430

We're assuming inductively, right? So,

1098
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,440
We're assuming inductively, right? So,
 

1099
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,389
We're assuming inductively, right? So,
we're saying that if inductively I have

1100
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:50,399
we're saying that if inductively I have
 

1101
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,190
we're saying that if inductively I have
both of these things to be true, then

1102
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
both of these things to be true, then
 

1103
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,470
both of these things to be true, then
can I conclude something for the next

1104
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
can I conclude something for the next
 

1105
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,070
can I conclude something for the next
layer?

1106
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,080

 

1107
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,230

Okay.

1108
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,240
Okay.
 

1109
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,070
Okay.
So what I want to just point out is that

1110
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,080
So what I want to just point out is that
 

1111
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,710
So what I want to just point out is that
is that gives us basically conditions

1112
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:06,720
is that gives us basically conditions
 

1113
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,669
is that gives us basically conditions
about the RMS norm of the uh

1114
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:11,679
about the RMS norm of the uh
 

1115
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,669
about the RMS norm of the uh
of the weight matrices both the weight

1116
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:13,679
of the weight matrices both the weight
 

1117
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,310
of the weight matrices both the weight
matrix itself as well as the update in

1118
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,320
matrix itself as well as the update in
 

1119
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,430
matrix itself as well as the update in
the weight matrix. Okay.

1120
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440

 

1121
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,110

And these are conditions basically that

1122
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,120
And these are conditions basically that
 

1123
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,950
And these are conditions basically that
are that we've we've come to and seen

1124
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:24,960
are that we've we've come to and seen
 

1125
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,909
are that we've we've come to and seen
before. This is just yet another way of

1126
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:27,919
before. This is just yet another way of
 

1127
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,549
before. This is just yet another way of
looking at them and coming to them. Do

1128
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:30,559
looking at them and coming to them. Do
 

1129
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,110
looking at them and coming to them. Do
you want to add something?

1130
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,120

 

1131
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,029

>> RMS norm. I'm sorry, this is a typo.

1132
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:37,039
>> RMS norm. I'm sorry, this is a typo.
 

1133
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,149
>> RMS norm. I'm sorry, this is a typo.
Yes.

1134
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,159
Yes.
 

1135
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,029
Yes.
>> Thank you.

1136
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:43,039

 

1137
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,830

Thank you.

1138
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:49,840

 

1139
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,870

So from this now remember MUP was

1140
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:52,880
So from this now remember MUP was
 

1141
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,350
So from this now remember MUP was
talking about scaling of the learning

1142
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,360
talking about scaling of the learning
 

1143
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,190
talking about scaling of the learning
rates, right?

1144
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
rates, right?
 

1145
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,669
rates, right?
What I'm not going to go into here but

1146
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
What I'm not going to go into here but
 

1147
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,350
What I'm not going to go into here but
again you can look at this in in the

1148
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360
again you can look at this in in the
 

1149
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,590
again you can look at this in in the
paper and we gave a sketch of this

1150
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
paper and we gave a sketch of this
 

1151
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,590
paper and we gave a sketch of this
essentially earlier is from this we can

1152
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:07,600
essentially earlier is from this we can
 

1153
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,589
essentially earlier is from this we can
derive how the uh learning rate should

1154
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:11,599
derive how the uh learning rate should
 

1155
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,430
derive how the uh learning rate should
scale as a factor a as a function of

1156
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:15,440
scale as a factor a as a function of
 

1157
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,230
scale as a factor a as a function of
these din and douts. And if you recall

1158
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,240
these din and douts. And if you recall
 

1159
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,629
these din and douts. And if you recall
last time we had this we came to kind of

1160
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:22,639
last time we had this we came to kind of
 

1161
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,069
last time we had this we came to kind of
uh this conclusion. This argument uh

1162
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:26,079
uh this conclusion. This argument uh
 

1163
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,990
uh this conclusion. This argument uh
will lead you to a very similar

1164
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,000
will lead you to a very similar
 

1165
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,310
will lead you to a very similar
conclusion. We're not doing it here. We

1166
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,320
conclusion. We're not doing it here. We
 

1167
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,149
conclusion. We're not doing it here. We
already did like kind of the the rough

1168
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
already did like kind of the the rough
 

1169
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,030
already did like kind of the the rough
argument earlier last time in lecture.

1170
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,040
argument earlier last time in lecture.
 

1171
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,950
argument earlier last time in lecture.
Okay.

1172
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:36,960
Okay.
 

1173
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,349
Okay.
What I wanted to just point out is these

1174
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:39,359
What I wanted to just point out is these
 

1175
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,909
What I wanted to just point out is these
this desired property of what this is

1176
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:43,919
this desired property of what this is
 

1177
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,909
this desired property of what this is
why this is a reasonable thing. what it

1178
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
why this is a reasonable thing. what it
 

1179
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,710
why this is a reasonable thing. what it
means to have feature learning uh is

1180
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:48,720
means to have feature learning uh is
 

1181
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,669
means to have feature learning uh is
defined by these two is is defined by

1182
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:51,679
defined by these two is is defined by
 

1183
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,710
defined by these two is is defined by
the size of the hidden layers being

1184
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:54,720
the size of the hidden layers being
 

1185
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,069
the size of the hidden layers being
something and the size of the update

1186
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:56,079
something and the size of the update
 

1187
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,190
something and the size of the update
being appropriately the same u RMS norm

1188
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,200
being appropriately the same u RMS norm
 

1189
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,670
being appropriately the same u RMS norm
one both of these things and to achieve

1190
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:01,680
one both of these things and to achieve
 

1191
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,349
one both of these things and to achieve
this we want to have conditions on the

1192
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:05,359
this we want to have conditions on the
 

1193
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,030
this we want to have conditions on the
weight matrix itself as well as the

1194
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,040
weight matrix itself as well as the
 

1195
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,470
weight matrix itself as well as the
update to the weight matrix okay

1196
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:10,480
update to the weight matrix okay
 

1197
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,030
update to the weight matrix okay
and then with this we can use this to

1198
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,040
and then with this we can use this to
 

1199
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,349
and then with this we can use this to
basically derive scaling laws because

1200
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:15,359
basically derive scaling laws because
 

1201
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,910
basically derive scaling laws because
for our hyperparameters that are

1202
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:17,920
for our hyperparameters that are
 

1203
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,069
for our hyperparameters that are
identical to what the mu scaling laws

1204
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
identical to what the mu scaling laws
 

1205
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,550
identical to what the mu scaling laws
are. Okay,

1206
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:22,560
are. Okay,
 

1207
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,069
are. Okay,
question at the back.

1208
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:24,079
question at the back.
 

1209
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,470
question at the back.
>> Yeah, I was just following correctly. So

1210
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,480
>> Yeah, I was just following correctly. So
 

1211
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:35,670
>> Yeah, I was just following correctly. So
when you write

1212
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680

 

1213
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,950

>> dimension,

1214
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
>> dimension,
 

1215
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:46,310
>> dimension,
>> correct?

1216
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,320

 

1217
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,470

Yes.

1218
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480
Yes.
 

1219
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,270
Yes.
>> Correct.

1220
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:51,280
>> Correct.
 

1221
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,670
>> Correct.
>> Yes.

1222
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:51,680
>> Yes.
 

1223
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,349
>> Yes.
>> Does this idea apply to other parameters

1224
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:53,359
>> Does this idea apply to other parameters
 

1225
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,030
>> Does this idea apply to other parameters
besides learning rate?

1226
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
besides learning rate?
 

1227
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,030
besides learning rate?
>> Does this idea apply to other parameters

1228
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,040
>> Does this idea apply to other parameters
 

1229
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,589
>> Does this idea apply to other parameters
besides learning rate? Uh no. This is

1230
00:35:59,589 --> 00:35:59,599
besides learning rate? Uh no. This is
 

1231
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,310
besides learning rate? Uh no. This is
focused largely on the on the learning

1232
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:02,320
focused largely on the on the learning
 

1233
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,270
focused largely on the on the learning
rate. And furthermore, this is focused

1234
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,280
rate. And furthermore, this is focused
 

1235
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,550
rate. And furthermore, this is focused
on uh layers that are basically defined

1236
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:08,560
on uh layers that are basically defined
 

1237
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,109
on uh layers that are basically defined
by a matrix multiplication. So there are

1238
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:13,119
by a matrix multiplication. So there are
 

1239
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,270
by a matrix multiplication. So there are
other considerations that sometimes have

1240
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,280
other considerations that sometimes have
 

1241
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,270
other considerations that sometimes have
to be made for other structures of

1242
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,280
to be made for other structures of
 

1243
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,750
to be made for other structures of
layers that we're not going to be really

1244
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
layers that we're not going to be really
 

1245
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,550
layers that we're not going to be really
talking about.

1246
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
talking about.
 

1247
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:36,310
talking about.
>> Yeah.

1248
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,320

 

1249
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,589

Sorry, I'm not sure I'm understanding

1250
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:37,599
Sorry, I'm not sure I'm understanding
 

1251
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:50,310
Sorry, I'm not sure I'm understanding
your question.

1252
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:50,320

 

1253
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,069

>> So like with these conditions we just

1254
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:52,079
>> So like with these conditions we just
 

1255
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,790
>> So like with these conditions we just
got that the change in the weights is

1256
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:54,800
got that the change in the weights is
 

1257
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,069
got that the change in the weights is
order. So like is like what specifically

1258
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
order. So like is like what specifically
 

1259
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,390
order. So like is like what specifically
the order number is that's like hyperar.

1260
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:02,400
the order number is that's like hyperar.
 

1261
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:10,950
the order number is that's like hyperar.
>> Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1262
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:10,960

 

1263
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,910

Okay. Good. So now that we have this I

1264
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:13,920
Okay. Good. So now that we have this I
 

1265
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,150
Okay. Good. So now that we have this I
want to move to what I want to talk

1266
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,160
want to move to what I want to talk
 

1267
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,150
want to move to what I want to talk
about today

1268
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
about today
 

1269
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,710
about today
which is muon.

1270
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:20,720
which is muon.
 

1271
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,630
which is muon.
So, Muan is a

1272
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:24,640
So, Muan is a
 

1273
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,630
So, Muan is a
new optimizer

1274
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:26,640
new optimizer
 

1275
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,109
new optimizer
and the kind of claim to flame of muon.

1276
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:29,119
and the kind of claim to flame of muon.
 

1277
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,390
and the kind of claim to flame of muon.
Let me see actually maybe I should show

1278
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,400
Let me see actually maybe I should show
 

1279
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,750
Let me see actually maybe I should show
this slide just while I'm talking about

1280
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:31,760
this slide just while I'm talking about
 

1281
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:45,030
this slide just while I'm talking about
it again.

1282
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,040

 

1283
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,550

I think comes from when uh from this

1284
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:48,560
I think comes from when uh from this
 

1285
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,790
I think comes from when uh from this
experiment or called the nano GPT

1286
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
experiment or called the nano GPT
 

1287
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,870
experiment or called the nano GPT
speedrun right which is a a small

1288
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:52,880
speedrun right which is a a small
 

1289
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,150
speedrun right which is a a small
network and it's a kind of open

1290
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,160
network and it's a kind of open
 

1291
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,550
network and it's a kind of open
competition where people are challenged

1292
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:58,560
competition where people are challenged
 

1293
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,710

to say how fast can you get this

1294
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:00,720
to say how fast can you get this
 

1295
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,230
to say how fast can you get this
particular network to have this

1296
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,240
particular network to have this
 

1297
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,630
particular network to have this
particular validation loss and it

1298
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:04,640
particular validation loss and it
 

1299
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,910
particular validation loss and it
started out at a baseline in 2024 of

1300
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
started out at a baseline in 2024 of
 

1301
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,870
started out at a baseline in 2024 of
about 45 minutes and as you can see over

1302
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:10,880
about 45 minutes and as you can see over
 

1303
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,270
about 45 minutes and as you can see over
time there's been significant updates to

1304
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:13,280
time there's been significant updates to
 

1305
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,190
time there's been significant updates to
get it to do better what that I want to

1306
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,200
get it to do better what that I want to
 

1307
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,829
get it to do better what that I want to
draw your attention to

1308
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:17,839
draw your attention to
 

1309
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,990
draw your attention to
is this point here which is where when

1310
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,000
is this point here which is where when
 

1311
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,310
is this point here which is where when
the muon optimizer was introduced

1312
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:22,320
the muon optimizer was introduced
 

1313
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,349
the muon optimizer was introduced
suddenly that led to kind of a paradigm

1314
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:25,359
suddenly that led to kind of a paradigm
 

1315
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,990
suddenly that led to kind of a paradigm
change in how people were were thinking

1316
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,000
change in how people were were thinking
 

1317
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,109
change in how people were were thinking
about things and led to massive massive

1318
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:31,119
about things and led to massive massive
 

1319
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,069
about things and led to massive massive
improvements in the time required to

1320
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
improvements in the time required to
 

1321
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,270
improvements in the time required to
train this particular network. Okay. So

1322
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,280
train this particular network. Okay. So
 

1323
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,510
train this particular network. Okay. So
that's kind of our motivation for trying

1324
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:39,520
that's kind of our motivation for trying
 

1325
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,390
that's kind of our motivation for trying
to bring muon into the curriculum to

1326
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
to bring muon into the curriculum to
 

1327
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,750
to bring muon into the curriculum to
make sure you guys are kind of up to

1328
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:43,760
make sure you guys are kind of up to
 

1329
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,470
make sure you guys are kind of up to
date with what is happening uh in the

1330
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:46,480
date with what is happening uh in the
 

1331
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,710
date with what is happening uh in the
field. And the other thing is that this

1332
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
field. And the other thing is that this
 

1333
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,630
field. And the other thing is that this
was a nano GPT right this is a tiny

1334
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:50,640
was a nano GPT right this is a tiny
 

1335
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,230
was a nano GPT right this is a tiny
model but follow-up work has shown that

1336
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,240
model but follow-up work has shown that
 

1337
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,630
model but follow-up work has shown that
actually the ideas from muan can be

1338
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:56,640
actually the ideas from muan can be
 

1339
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,790
actually the ideas from muan can be
scaled up to be able to be used in much

1340
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:00,800
scaled up to be able to be used in much
 

1341
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,030
scaled up to be able to be used in much
much larger uh models. in particular is

1342
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,040
much larger uh models. in particular is
 

1343
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,950
much larger uh models. in particular is
Kimmy model is a tr trillion parameter

1344
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:04,960
Kimmy model is a tr trillion parameter
 

1345
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,870
Kimmy model is a tr trillion parameter
model which use muon and there's

1346
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:06,880
model which use muon and there's
 

1347
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,790
model which use muon and there's
evidence that um you know uh at least

1348
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:10,800
evidence that um you know uh at least
 

1349
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,430
evidence that um you know uh at least
the muup style ideas have made it they

1350
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:13,440
the muup style ideas have made it they
 

1351
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,750
the muup style ideas have made it they
made their way into training for uh

1352
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:15,760
made their way into training for uh
 

1353
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,470
made their way into training for uh
other standard other big frontier models

1354
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:18,480
other standard other big frontier models
 

1355
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,150
other standard other big frontier models
as well okay so let's now talk about

1356
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,160
as well okay so let's now talk about
 

1357
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,310
as well okay so let's now talk about
muon

1358
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:24,320
muon
 

1359
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,150
muon
so remember from last time we had this

1360
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,160
so remember from last time we had this
 

1361
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,430
so remember from last time we had this
optimizer recipe which is that okay I

1362
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:29,440
optimizer recipe which is that okay I
 

1363
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,390
optimizer recipe which is that okay I
want to choose a norm and within that

1364
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,400
want to choose a norm and within that
 

1365
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,829
want to choose a norm and within that
norm ball I want to basically be aligned

1366
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:35,839
norm ball I want to basically be aligned
 

1367
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,750
norm ball I want to basically be aligned
to the direction of the gradient. So I

1368
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:37,760
to the direction of the gradient. So I
 

1369
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,870
to the direction of the gradient. So I
want to find the best

1370
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:40,880
want to find the best
 

1371
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,829
want to find the best
uh step that I can take.

1372
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
uh step that I can take.
 

1373
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,349
uh step that I can take.
And we talked when we talked about

1374
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
And we talked when we talked about
 

1375
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,470
And we talked when we talked about
shampoo, we talked about saying well

1376
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
shampoo, we talked about saying well
 

1377
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,990
shampoo, we talked about saying well
what if we chose the spectral norm here

1378
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,000
what if we chose the spectral norm here
 

1379
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,390
what if we chose the spectral norm here
and we did this calculation I think two

1380
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:54,400
and we did this calculation I think two
 

1381
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,390
and we did this calculation I think two
lectures ago where we found that the

1382
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:56,400
lectures ago where we found that the
 

1383
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,470
lectures ago where we found that the
argument for this was ADA time um

1384
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:02,480

 

1385
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,910

u vranspose right here. Actually I

1386
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:05,920
u vranspose right here. Actually I
 

1387
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,750
u vranspose right here. Actually I
should write here maybe UR

1388
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:09,760

 

1389
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,750

VR transpose.

1390
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:13,760

 

1391
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,630

So what is this doing? This is basically

1392
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
So what is this doing? This is basically
 

1393
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,390
So what is this doing? This is basically
a

1394
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,400
a
 

1395
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,589
a
semi orthogonal update. What I mean by a

1396
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:21,599
semi orthogonal update. What I mean by a
 

1397
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,829
semi orthogonal update. What I mean by a
semi-orththogonal update is basically

1398
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:23,839
semi-orththogonal update is basically
 

1399
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,430
semi-orththogonal update is basically
this UR VR is something that you know if

1400
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:27,440
this UR VR is something that you know if
 

1401
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,910
this UR VR is something that you know if
if I take a matrix A and A a transposes

1402
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:29,920
if I take a matrix A and A a transposes
 

1403
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,310
if I take a matrix A and A a transposes
identity or A transpose A's identity at

1404
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:32,320
identity or A transpose A's identity at
 

1405
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,550
identity or A transpose A's identity at
least one of the ways that's what's

1406
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:34,560
least one of the ways that's what's
 

1407
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,829
least one of the ways that's what's
called a semi-orththogonal

1408
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:35,839
called a semi-orththogonal
 

1409
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,829
called a semi-orththogonal
semi-orththogonal matrix an orthogonal

1410
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:37,839
semi-orththogonal matrix an orthogonal
 

1411
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,230
semi-orththogonal matrix an orthogonal
matrix is one that has both of those

1412
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:40,240
matrix is one that has both of those
 

1413
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,990
matrix is one that has both of those
being true right it's only true on one

1414
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,000
being true right it's only true on one
 

1415
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,270
being true right it's only true on one
side it's called a semi-orththogonal

1416
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,280
side it's called a semi-orththogonal
 

1417
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,950
side it's called a semi-orththogonal
matrix

1418
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:44,960
matrix
 

1419
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,950
matrix
so what this gives us as the update

1420
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:46,960
so what this gives us as the update
 

1421
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,190
so what this gives us as the update
equation is the following which is that

1422
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,200
equation is the following which is that
 

1423
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,950
equation is the following which is that
WT +1 is wt minus ADA time this update

1424
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:52,960
WT +1 is wt minus ADA time this update
 

1425
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,750
WT +1 is wt minus ADA time this update
and this is the key update behind the

1426
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:55,760
and this is the key update behind the
 

1427
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,870
and this is the key update behind the
shampoo uh shampoo algorithm without

1428
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:58,880
shampoo uh shampoo algorithm without
 

1429
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,630
shampoo uh shampoo algorithm without
accumulation and what I mean by without

1430
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:00,640
accumulation and what I mean by without
 

1431
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,630
accumulation and what I mean by without
accumulation is that basically I'm not

1432
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:02,640
accumulation is that basically I'm not
 

1433
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,870
accumulation is that basically I'm not
doing a momentum like aggregation or

1434
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:04,880
doing a momentum like aggregation or
 

1435
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,829
doing a momentum like aggregation or
averaging of the gradients

1436
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:07,839
averaging of the gradients
 

1437
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,150
averaging of the gradients
um I'm ignoring that even though shampoo

1438
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,160
um I'm ignoring that even though shampoo
 

1439
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,550
um I'm ignoring that even though shampoo
in in reality will actually do an

1440
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
in in reality will actually do an
 

1441
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,190
in in reality will actually do an
aggregation and a uh and a a moment a

1442
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,200
aggregation and a uh and a a moment a
 

1443
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,670
aggregation and a uh and a a moment a
momentum averaging there. Okay, so we're

1444
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:19,680
momentum averaging there. Okay, so we're
 

1445
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,430
momentum averaging there. Okay, so we're
we're ignoring that. But if you turn

1446
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:21,440
we're ignoring that. But if you turn
 

1447
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,430
we're ignoring that. But if you turn
that accumulation off, this is exactly

1448
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:23,440
that accumulation off, this is exactly
 

1449
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,910
that accumulation off, this is exactly
the update that you get.

1450
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920
the update that you get.
 

1451
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,750
the update that you get.
So if you look at the shampoo algorithm,

1452
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:27,760
So if you look at the shampoo algorithm,
 

1453
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,349
So if you look at the shampoo algorithm,
right? If you go open the shampoo paper,

1454
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:31,359
right? If you go open the shampoo paper,
 

1455
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,190
right? If you go open the shampoo paper,
this is not what it looks like. The

1456
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200
this is not what it looks like. The
 

1457
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,750
this is not what it looks like. The
shampoo paper looks quite a bit more

1458
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:35,760
shampoo paper looks quite a bit more
 

1459
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,270
shampoo paper looks quite a bit more
complicated.

1460
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:37,280
complicated.
 

1461
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,790
complicated.
Even here, what I have is a slightly

1462
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:38,800
Even here, what I have is a slightly
 

1463
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,470
Even here, what I have is a slightly
simplified version, but it looks more

1464
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:40,480
simplified version, but it looks more
 

1465
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,670
simplified version, but it looks more
like this. So, I have what is called a

1466
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
like this. So, I have what is called a
 

1467
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,589
like this. So, I have what is called a
left preconditioner and a right

1468
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:45,599
left preconditioner and a right
 

1469
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,589
left preconditioner and a right
preconditioner, which I had said, by the

1470
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:47,599
preconditioner, which I had said, by the
 

1471
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,190
preconditioner, which I had said, by the
way, I'd gave you the reason for why

1472
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,200
way, I'd gave you the reason for why
 

1473
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,589
way, I'd gave you the reason for why
shampoo is called shampoo. It's because

1474
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:51,599
shampoo is called shampoo. It's because
 

1475
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,030
shampoo is called shampoo. It's because
you use conditioners.

1476
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,040
you use conditioners.
 

1477
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,630
you use conditioners.
Um,

1478
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:56,640
Um,
 

1479
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,630
Um,
and you have left ones and you have

1480
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:58,640
and you have left ones and you have
 

1481
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,030
and you have left ones and you have
right ones. So LT is the left

1482
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
right ones. So LT is the left
 

1483
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,109
right ones. So LT is the left
preconditioning matrix which is

1484
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
preconditioning matrix which is
 

1485
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,430
preconditioning matrix which is
basically an averaging of G gRpose where

1486
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
basically an averaging of G gRpose where
 

1487
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,150
basically an averaging of G gRpose where
G is your gradient

1488
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,160
G is your gradient
 

1489
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,069
G is your gradient
and the right preconditioning matrix

1490
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:12,079
and the right preconditioning matrix
 

1491
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,990
and the right preconditioning matrix
comes from G-rpose G

1492
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,000
comes from G-rpose G
 

1493
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,829
comes from G-rpose G
and these are basically one way to think

1494
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:17,839
and these are basically one way to think
 

1495
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,430
and these are basically one way to think
about it very very roughly um is to

1496
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:21,440
about it very very roughly um is to
 

1497
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,990
about it very very roughly um is to
think of you're basically

1498
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,000
think of you're basically
 

1499
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,309
think of you're basically
rotating your matrix to be

1500
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:28,319
rotating your matrix to be
 

1501
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,950
rotating your matrix to be
in a particular

1502
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:30,960
in a particular
 

1503
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,670
in a particular
space though that intuition is not as

1504
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:33,680
space though that intuition is not as
 

1505
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,510
space though that intuition is not as
clean. I think the cleanest, nicest way

1506
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:35,520
clean. I think the cleanest, nicest way
 

1507
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,109
clean. I think the cleanest, nicest way
of thinking about it is really this um

1508
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:39,119
of thinking about it is really this um
 

1509
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,030
of thinking about it is really this um
kind of Frank Wolf style perspective

1510
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,040
kind of Frank Wolf style perspective
 

1511
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,349
kind of Frank Wolf style perspective
that we've um that we've talked about

1512
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:43,359
that we've um that we've talked about
 

1513
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,349
that we've um that we've talked about
here.

1514
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:45,359
here.
 

1515
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,309
here.
Okay, so this is what the shampoo update

1516
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:48,319
Okay, so this is what the shampoo update
 

1517
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,550
Okay, so this is what the shampoo update
actually like.

1518
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:50,560
actually like.
 

1519
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,630
actually like.
Um

1520
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:52,640
Um
 

1521
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,470
Um
and if you take shampoo without

1522
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:54,480
and if you take shampoo without
 

1523
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,870
and if you take shampoo without
accumulation so basically I don't do

1524
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
accumulation so basically I don't do
 

1525
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,190
accumulation so basically I don't do
this averaging and so I just set my left

1526
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,200
this averaging and so I just set my left
 

1527
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,589
this averaging and so I just set my left
preconditioner to be ggrpose and my

1528
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
preconditioner to be ggrpose and my
 

1529
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,790
preconditioner to be ggrpose and my
right preconditioner to be ganspose g

1530
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:06,800
right preconditioner to be ganspose g
 

1531
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,150
right preconditioner to be ganspose g
then what I get as my uh

1532
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:12,160
then what I get as my uh
 

1533
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,990
then what I get as my uh
update equation is given by this

1534
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:14,000
update equation is given by this
 

1535
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,510
update equation is given by this
equation

1536
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:15,520
equation
 

1537
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,270
equation
okay

1538
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,280
okay
 

1539
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,790
okay
so I have these inverse fourth roots

1540
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:20,800
so I have these inverse fourth roots
 

1541
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,510
so I have these inverse fourth roots
Why is shampoo why was shampoo why did

1542
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:23,520
Why is shampoo why was shampoo why did
 

1543
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,349
Why is shampoo why was shampoo why did
shampoo come up with this? Right. Well,

1544
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:27,359
shampoo come up with this? Right. Well,
 

1545
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,670
shampoo come up with this? Right. Well,
there was this intuition from that we

1546
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:29,680
there was this intuition from that we
 

1547
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,790
there was this intuition from that we
know from uh Adagrad and from all

1548
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:32,800
know from uh Adagrad and from all
 

1549
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,550
know from uh Adagrad and from all
everything we've been talking about on

1550
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:34,560
everything we've been talking about on
 

1551
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,190
everything we've been talking about on
on gradient descent that you want to

1552
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,200
on gradient descent that you want to
 

1553
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,550
on gradient descent that you want to
sometimes it's there's value in

1554
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:38,560
sometimes it's there's value in
 

1555
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,630
sometimes it's there's value in
equalizing which directions you're

1556
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:40,640
equalizing which directions you're
 

1557
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,910
equalizing which directions you're
you're going you're you're going in.

1558
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:43,920
you're going you're you're going in.
 

1559
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,670
you're going you're you're going in.
And so there was this was an attempt at

1560
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:47,680
And so there was this was an attempt at
 

1561
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,349
And so there was this was an attempt at
trying to get more, you know, uniform in

1562
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:51,359
trying to get more, you know, uniform in
 

1563
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,550
trying to get more, you know, uniform in
all of the directions that you're going

1564
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:52,560
all of the directions that you're going
 

1565
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,910
all of the directions that you're going
in. But as you know, computing the SVD

1566
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
in. But as you know, computing the SVD
 

1567
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,349
in. But as you know, computing the SVD
is hard. And that's where these fourth

1568
00:43:59,349 --> 00:43:59,359
is hard. And that's where these fourth
 

1569
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,910
is hard. And that's where these fourth
roots kind of come in.

1570
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
roots kind of come in.
 

1571
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,069
roots kind of come in.
So it turns out that these inverse

1572
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:04,079
So it turns out that these inverse
 

1573
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,030
So it turns out that these inverse
fourth roots you can compute

1574
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,040
fourth roots you can compute
 

1575
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,630
fourth roots you can compute
somewhat efficiently. Champoo is still

1576
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,640
somewhat efficiently. Champoo is still
 

1577
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,230
somewhat efficiently. Champoo is still
an expensive algorithm compared to

1578
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:10,240
an expensive algorithm compared to
 

1579
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,230
an expensive algorithm compared to
something like Adam, but you can compute

1580
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:12,240
something like Adam, but you can compute
 

1581
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,630
something like Adam, but you can compute
them more efficiently than by doing the

1582
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:14,640
them more efficiently than by doing the
 

1583
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,829
them more efficiently than by doing the
SVD through a variation on basically the

1584
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:17,839
SVD through a variation on basically the
 

1585
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,630
SVD through a variation on basically the
Newton root finding algorithm. Okay, so

1586
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:20,640
Newton root finding algorithm. Okay, so
 

1587
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,630
Newton root finding algorithm. Okay, so
there's a Newton iterative Newton style

1588
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:22,640
there's a Newton iterative Newton style
 

1589
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,950
there's a Newton iterative Newton style
iterative algorithm that you can use to

1590
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:24,960
iterative algorithm that you can use to
 

1591
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,349
iterative algorithm that you can use to
compute these fourth roots which is why

1592
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:27,359
compute these fourth roots which is why
 

1593
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,750
compute these fourth roots which is why
kind of shampoo

1594
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:29,760
kind of shampoo
 

1595
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,790
kind of shampoo
ended up in being being what is it what

1596
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:32,800
ended up in being being what is it what
 

1597
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,630
ended up in being being what is it what
it is with these particular fourth

1598
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:34,640
it is with these particular fourth
 

1599
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,630
it is with these particular fourth
roots. Um this understanding of shampoo

1600
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:38,640
roots. Um this understanding of shampoo
 

1601
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,990
roots. Um this understanding of shampoo
without accumulation as being this uh UV

1602
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,000

shampoo had been developed. Yes.

1606
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:45,839
shampoo had been developed. Yes.
 

1607
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:51,829
shampoo had been developed. Yes.
Question at the back.

1608
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:51,839

 

1609
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,589

>> So I've turned the question was where

1610
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:53,599
>> So I've turned the question was where
 

1611
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,230
>> So I've turned the question was where
did these LTUS1 and RTUS1 terms go? I've

1612
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:56,240
did these LTUS1 and RTUS1 terms go? I've
 

1613
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,430
did these LTUS1 and RTUS1 terms go? I've
turned out turned off accumulation.

1614
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,440
turned out turned off accumulation.
 

1615
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,069
turned out turned off accumulation.
So I'm just instead of averaging over

1616
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:02,079
So I'm just instead of averaging over
 

1617
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,190
So I'm just instead of averaging over
time I'm just using the current update

1618
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:05,200
time I'm just using the current update

1623
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,790

for SVD. No, but we will do a little bit

1624
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:22,800
for SVD. No, but we will do a little bit
 

1625
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,790
for SVD. No, but we will do a little bit
of a calculation that will I think

1626
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:24,800
of a calculation that will I think
 

1627
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,510
of a calculation that will I think
resolve your confusion in one minute.

resolve your confusion in one minute.
 

1629

resolve your confusion in one minute.
>> Yes.

1630
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200

1641
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,109
to go into all of the intricacies of
shampoo right now. the real shampoo

1642
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:45,119
shampoo right now. the real shampoo
 

1643
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,430
shampoo right now. the real shampoo
deals with momentum and many of the

1644
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,440
deals with momentum and many of the
 

1645
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,670
deals with momentum and many of the
theoretical analysis are very hard to do

1646
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:49,680
theoretical analysis are very hard to do
 

1647
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,510
theoretical analysis are very hard to do
when you have that momentum style term

1648
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:51,520
when you have that momentum style term
 

1649
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,069
when you have that momentum style term
in there. So right now we're thinking of

1650
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:54,079
in there. So right now we're thinking of
 

1651
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,150
in there. So right now we're thinking of
no accumulation, right? So we're just

1652
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160
no accumulation, right? So we're just
 

1653
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,829
no accumulation, right? So we're just
trying to understand what the uh just

1654
00:45:59,829 --> 00:45:59,839
trying to understand what the uh just
 

1655
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,109
trying to understand what the uh just
with the current gradient update.

1656
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:03,119
with the current gradient update.
 

1657
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,349
with the current gradient update.
>> Yes, question.

1658
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:07,359

 

1659
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,109

>> Um because you can do them you can

00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:09,119
>> Um because you can do them you can

compute them in an iterative style of

1662
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:11,920
compute them in an iterative style of
 

1663
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,589
compute them in an iterative style of
root finding. So like there's a there's

1664
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:13,599
root finding. So like there's a there's
 

1665
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,150
root finding. So like there's a there's
a variant of Newton's algorithm that can

1666
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:16,160
a variant of Newton's algorithm that can
 

1667
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,710
a variant of Newton's algorithm that can
be used to uh to compute these

1668
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:18,720
be used to uh to compute these
 

1669
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:29,670
be used to uh to compute these
efficiently.

1670
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,680

 

1671
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,430

Okay.

1672
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
Okay.
 

1673
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,109
Okay.
So to see what the connection of this

1674
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:33,119
So to see what the connection of this
 

1675
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,710
So to see what the connection of this
fourth root is and why it's connected to

1676
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:34,720
fourth root is and why it's connected to
 

1677
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,230
fourth root is and why it's connected to
the SCD, I want I just wanted to show

1678
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:36,240
the SCD, I want I just wanted to show
 

1679
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,870
the SCD, I want I just wanted to show
you this little calculation.

1680
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:38,880
you this little calculation.
 

1681
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,550
you this little calculation.
So if I think about my GT as having uh

1682
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:42,560
So if I think about my GT as having uh
 

1683
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:48,069
So if I think about my GT as having uh
the SVD

1684
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079

 

1685
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,309

u sigma vranspose okay

1686
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:52,319
u sigma vranspose okay
 

1687
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,109
u sigma vranspose okay
then I can think of gtranspose

1688
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:55,119
then I can think of gtranspose
 

1689
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,990
then I can think of gtranspose
here

1690
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:58,000
here
 

1691
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,510
here
as u sigma banspose v sigma transpose

1692
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:01,520
as u sigma banspose v sigma transpose
 

1693
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,309
as u sigma banspose v sigma transpose
urpose my vransposes cancel and what I

1694
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:04,319
urpose my vransposes cancel and what I
 

1695
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,550
urpose my vransposes cancel and what I
get is just this u sigma sigma transpose

1696
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:06,560
get is just this u sigma sigma transpose
 

1697
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,589
get is just this u sigma sigma transpose
urpose everyone see

1698
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:09,599
urpose everyone see
 

1699
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,550
urpose everyone see
And then similarly I can compute the the

1700
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:12,560
And then similarly I can compute the the
 

1701
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,349
And then similarly I can compute the the
other side of that

1702
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:15,359
other side of that
 

1703
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,430
other side of that
in the exact same way. Right? This is

1704
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:17,440
in the exact same way. Right? This is
 

1705
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,790
in the exact same way. Right? This is
one the left preconditioner and the

1706
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800
one the left preconditioner and the
 

1707
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,190
one the left preconditioner and the
right preconditioner. Okay. So what is

1708
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,200
right preconditioner. Okay. So what is
 

1709
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,829
right preconditioner. Okay. So what is
happening here when I take these uh

1710
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:23,839
happening here when I take these uh
 

1711
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,150
happening here when I take these uh
fourth roots

1712
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:26,160
fourth roots
 

1713
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,309
fourth roots
well let's just consider one case and

1714
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,319
well let's just consider one case and
 

1715
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,910
well let's just consider one case and
you can work this out case by case but

1716
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:29,920
you can work this out case by case but
 

1717
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,190
you can work this out case by case but
we don't really know what the shape of

1718
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:31,200
we don't really know what the shape of
 

1719
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,069
we don't really know what the shape of
GT is. Let's say it was a a matrix like

1720
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:34,079
GT is. Let's say it was a a matrix like
 

1721
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,510
GT is. Let's say it was a a matrix like
this. It's a wide matrix.

1722
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:37,520
this. It's a wide matrix.
 

1723
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,710
this. It's a wide matrix.
And so that means that my sigma is also

1724
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:40,720
And so that means that my sigma is also
 

1725
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,710
And so that means that my sigma is also
going to be a wide matrix. And the way

1726
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:42,720
going to be a wide matrix. And the way
 

1727
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,870
going to be a wide matrix. And the way
it's going to look is I'm going to have

1728
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:44,880
it's going to look is I'm going to have
 

1729
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,510
it's going to look is I'm going to have
a part here that has singular values

1730
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:47,520
a part here that has singular values
 

1731
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,750
a part here that has singular values
along the diagonal. And then there's

1732
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:49,760
along the diagonal. And then there's
 

1733
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,270
along the diagonal. And then there's
going to be a bunch of zeros over here.

1734
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,280
going to be a bunch of zeros over here.
 

1735
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,349
going to be a bunch of zeros over here.
Right? That's what my uh SVD is going to

1736
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:53,359
Right? That's what my uh SVD is going to
 

1737
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,870
Right? That's what my uh SVD is going to
look like or that's my what my singular

1738
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:54,880
look like or that's my what my singular
 

1739
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,430
look like or that's my what my singular
value matrix is going to look like. And

1740
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:57,440
value matrix is going to look like. And
 

1741
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,430
value matrix is going to look like. And
let's just say for now I assume that

1742
00:47:59,430 --> 00:47:59,440
let's just say for now I assume that
 

1743
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,190
let's just say for now I assume that
this is full row rank. So there's no

1744
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:01,200
this is full row rank. So there's no
 

1745
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,190
this is full row rank. So there's no
zeros here at all. It's possible that

1746
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:03,200
zeros here at all. It's possible that
 

1747
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,589
zeros here at all. It's possible that
you could actually have a subp part here

1748
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:05,599
you could actually have a subp part here
 

1749
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,109
you could actually have a subp part here
depending on the rank of your matrix.

1750
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:07,119
depending on the rank of your matrix.
 

1751
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,950
depending on the rank of your matrix.
But let's just assume for now that this

1752
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:08,960
But let's just assume for now that this
 

1753
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,710
But let's just assume for now that this
is full row rank.

1754
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,720

 

1755
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,030

Then what I'm going to do is I'm I want

1756
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,040
Then what I'm going to do is I'm I want
 

1757
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,190
Then what I'm going to do is I'm I want
to basically say well how do I compute

1758
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:17,200
to basically say well how do I compute
 

1759
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,030
to basically say well how do I compute
the fourth roots of these guys? Right?

1760
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,040
the fourth roots of these guys? Right?
 

1761
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,309
the fourth roots of these guys? Right?
That's like a complicated thing in when

1762
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:22,319
That's like a complicated thing in when
 

1763
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,910
That's like a complicated thing in when
you're implementing shampoo. You would

1764
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:23,920
you're implementing shampoo. You would
 

1765
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,190
you're implementing shampoo. You would
not do something like this. You would

1766
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:25,200
not do something like this. You would
 

1767
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,589
not do something like this. You would
not compute the SVD. You could and that

1768
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:27,599
not compute the SVD. You could and that
 

1769
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,670
not compute the SVD. You could and that
would still that would be a valid way of

1770
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:29,680
would still that would be a valid way of
 

1771
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,670
would still that would be a valid way of
computing this but that's not how

1772
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:31,680
computing this but that's not how
 

1773
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,150
computing this but that's not how
shampoo does it

1774
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,160
shampoo does it
 

1775
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,630
shampoo does it
but now when I think about this sigma

1776
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,640
but now when I think about this sigma
 

1777
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,430
but now when I think about this sigma
sigma transpose this basically just

1778
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:39,440
sigma transpose this basically just
 

1779
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,069
sigma transpose this basically just
gives me a square matrix with singular

1780
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:42,079
gives me a square matrix with singular
 

1781
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,870
gives me a square matrix with singular
value squares along the diagonal right

1782
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:44,880
value squares along the diagonal right
 

1783
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,589
value squares along the diagonal right
because I have these these zeros

1784
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:47,599
because I have these these zeros
 

1785
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,230
because I have these these zeros
basically hit each other and so I have

1786
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:50,240
basically hit each other and so I have
 

1787
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,150
basically hit each other and so I have
this now square matrix with singular

1788
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,160
this now square matrix with singular
 

1789
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,750
this now square matrix with singular
values along the diagonal over here.

1790
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:55,760
values along the diagonal over here.
 

1791
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,870
values along the diagonal over here.
Okay. And now I can take fourth roots

1792
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:58,880
Okay. And now I can take fourth roots
 

1793
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,870
Okay. And now I can take fourth roots
basically

1794
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:00,880
basically
 

1795
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,230
basically
by taking the fourth the inverse fourth

1796
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,240
by taking the fourth the inverse fourth
 

1797
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,309
by taking the fourth the inverse fourth
root of this. Well I have a sigma 1

1798
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:06,319
root of this. Well I have a sigma 1
 

1799
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,990
root of this. Well I have a sigma 1
squared here. Sigma 2 * -1 over4 gives

1800
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:10,000
squared here. Sigma 2 * -1 over4 gives
 

1801
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,309
squared here. Sigma 2 * -1 over4 gives
me -1 /2.

1802
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:12,319
me -1 /2.
 

1803
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,670
me -1 /2.
So I have the fourth root of g gt

1804
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:15,680
So I have the fourth root of g gt
 

1805
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,950
So I have the fourth root of g gt
gtrpose is given by u. Then a square

1806
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:18,960
gtrpose is given by u. Then a square
 

1807
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,270
gtrpose is given by u. Then a square
matrix with sigma i to the minus1 /2 on

1808
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280
matrix with sigma i to the minus1 /2 on
 

1809
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,470
matrix with sigma i to the minus1 /2 on
that diagonal. and then uranspose.

1810
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:28,480

 

1811
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,510

Similarly, when I do um I can look at

1812
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:33,520
Similarly, when I do um I can look at
 

1813
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,430
Similarly, when I do um I can look at
the right preconditioner and then I have

1814
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:35,440
the right preconditioner and then I have
 

1815
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,309
the right preconditioner and then I have
gt trpose gt again if I take this uh

1816
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:40,319
gt trpose gt again if I take this uh
 

1817
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,950
gt trpose gt again if I take this uh
inverse fourth root the inverse fourth

1818
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:42,960
inverse fourth root the inverse fourth
 

1819
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,750
inverse fourth root the inverse fourth
root of sigma n^ squ is just sigma 1 to

1820
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:45,760
root of sigma n^ squ is just sigma 1 to
 

1821
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,190
root of sigma n^ squ is just sigma 1 to
the uh is just one over sigma square

1822
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,200
the uh is just one over sigma square
 

1823
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,549
the uh is just one over sigma square
root sigma 1. So I have this here and

1824
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
root sigma 1. So I have this here and
 

1825
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,230
root sigma 1. So I have this here and
now this is a bigger matrix right. So

1826
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,240
now this is a bigger matrix right. So
 

1827
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:00,790
now this is a bigger matrix right. So
here I will have some zeros.

1828
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:00,800

 

1829
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,950

But now when I look at basically this

1830
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:02,960
But now when I look at basically this
 

1831
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,230
But now when I look at basically this
particular quantity this gt gtranspose

1832
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:06,240
particular quantity this gt gtranspose
 

1833
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,150
particular quantity this gt gtranspose
minus to the minus 1/4 this whole thing

1834
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:10,160
minus to the minus 1/4 this whole thing
 

1835
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,750
minus to the minus 1/4 this whole thing
I get that all of my u's and v's cancel

1836
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:13,760
I get that all of my u's and v's cancel
 

1837
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,670
I get that all of my u's and v's cancel
and I just basically get out that I have

1838
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:17,680
and I just basically get out that I have
 

1839
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,950
and I just basically get out that I have
the uvranspose that I started with right

1840
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:20,960
the uvranspose that I started with right
 

1841
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,589
the uvranspose that I started with right
or that I wanted to get and that I got

1842
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:23,599
or that I wanted to get and that I got
 

1843
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,230
or that I wanted to get and that I got
in some sense very naturally

1844
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
in some sense very naturally
 

1845
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,589
in some sense very naturally
from looking at this uh optimization

1846
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:29,599
from looking at this uh optimization
 

1847
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,109
from looking at this uh optimization
ccentric perspective.

1848
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:31,119
ccentric perspective.
 

1849
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,030
ccentric perspective.
Okay.

1850
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,040
Okay.
 

1851
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,109
Okay.
So, if you look at the shampoo paper, I

1852
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:35,119
So, if you look at the shampoo paper, I
 

1853
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,069
So, if you look at the shampoo paper, I
just wanted to put this out there

1854
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:36,079
just wanted to put this out there
 

1855
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,030
just wanted to put this out there
because, you know, we've talked about

1856
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,040
because, you know, we've talked about
 

1857
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,230
because, you know, we've talked about
shampoo. You might go and look at the

1858
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:38,240
shampoo. You might go and look at the
 

1859
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,750
shampoo. You might go and look at the
paper and like this is nothing like what

1860
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:39,760
paper and like this is nothing like what
 

1861
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,829
paper and like this is nothing like what
we talked about in lecture. It's totally

1862
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:41,839
we talked about in lecture. It's totally
 

1863
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,030
we talked about in lecture. It's totally
different. But it's actually the same

1864
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:45,040
different. But it's actually the same
 

1865
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,829
different. But it's actually the same
thing. Again, uh the SVD kind of shows

1866
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:47,839
thing. Again, uh the SVD kind of shows
 

1867
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,750
thing. Again, uh the SVD kind of shows
you uh how these two things are

1868
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:49,760
you uh how these two things are
 

1869
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,589
you uh how these two things are
connected.

1870
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:51,599
connected.
 

1871
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,230
connected.
Okay.

1872
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:54,240
Okay.
 

1873
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,190
Okay.
So, this is great. And so, any questions

1874
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:57,200
So, this is great. And so, any questions
 

1875
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,549
So, this is great. And so, any questions
about this?

1876
00:50:58,549 --> 00:50:58,559

1889
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,829
computationally efficient to do than
computing a full SVD and that is why uh

1890
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:21,839
computing a full SVD and that is why uh
 

1891
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:24,630
computing a full SVD and that is why uh
this this is done but it's still not

1892
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:24,640
this this is done but it's still not
 

1893
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,790
this this is done but it's still not
super efficient and so that's what muon

1894
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:26,800
super efficient and so that's what muon
 

1895
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,549
super efficient and so that's what muon
solves that problem by coming up with an

00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,790

00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:34,800

1899
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,790
even more efficient method.
Okay. Yes.

1900
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:36,800
Okay. Yes.
 

1901
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,430

you want but here what you're trying to
 

1915
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,630
you want but here what you're trying to
do is you're trying to cancel out the

1916
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
do is you're trying to cancel out the
 

1917
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,670
do is you're trying to cancel out the
effect of the singular values right. So

1918
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,680
effect of the singular values right. So
 

1919
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,190
effect of the singular values right. So
there's going to be singular values in

1920
00:51:59,190 --> 00:51:59,200
there's going to be singular values in
 

1921
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,870
there's going to be singular values in
your gradient and if you want to

1922
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:00,880
your gradient and if you want to
 

1923
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,470
your gradient and if you want to
minimize their impact then you want to

1924
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:02,480
minimize their impact then you want to
 

1925
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,069
minimize their impact then you want to
divide by those singular values.

1926
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:06,079
divide by those singular values.
 

1927
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,589
divide by those singular values.
One thing to note actually this is

1928
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:07,599
One thing to note actually this is
 

1929
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,510
One thing to note actually this is
interesting that there's some papers

1930
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:09,520
interesting that there's some papers
 

1931
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,829
interesting that there's some papers
that are reported that in practice

1932
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:11,839
that are reported that in practice
 

1933
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,790

1937
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,510

and if you do this calculation that

1938
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:19,520
and if you do this calculation that
 

1939
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,510

Accumulation is this idea of like

1964
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200
Accumulation is this idea of like
 

1965
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,230
Accumulation is this idea of like
momentum is accumulation. So, so what

1966
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,240
momentum is accumulation. So, so what
 

1967
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,829
momentum is accumulation. So, so what
what is momentum doing? Momentum is

1968

what is momentum doing? Momentum is
 

1969
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,430
what is momentum doing? Momentum is
saying let me take the average of the

00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:05,440
saying let me take the average of the
 

1971
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,670
saying let me take the average of the
gradients to get kind of a smoother

1972
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:07,680

1975
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,150
version of the gradient. Right? If you
remember we looked at those plots where

1976
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:10,160
remember we looked at those plots where
 

1977
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,910
remember we looked at those plots where
like the momentum trajectories look

1978
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:11,920
like the momentum trajectories look
 

1979

1983
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,670
descent sometimes looks kind of jagged.
So accumulation is saying here in this

1984
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:19,680
So accumulation is saying here in this
 

1985
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,910
So accumulation is saying here in this
case I'm averaging whatever this gt

1986
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:23,920
case I'm averaging whatever this gt

gtrpose quantity is over time. That's
 

1989
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:32,069
gtrpose quantity is over time. That's
what this is doing here.

1990
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:32,079

 

1991
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:36,230

So this is this this is accumulation.

1992
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:36,240
So this is this this is accumulation.
 

1993
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,950
So this is this this is accumulation.
>> Oh.

1994
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:40,960

Does that make sense?
 

2009
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,670

many different so this quantity there's
 

2041
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,589

2059
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,390
variations to see which is the kind of
best one for implementation. Shampoo was

best one for implementation. Shampoo was
 

2061
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,230

2065
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,309

about the L&R. L and R are what are
 

2077
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:37,030
about the L&R. L and R are what are
called the preconditioners. Yes.

2078
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:37,040

 

2079
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:44,069

>> Yes.

2080
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:44,079

 

2081
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,829

Okay. Good.

2082
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:49,839

 

2083
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,069

Okay. So we have these semi-orththogonal

2084
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
Okay. So we have these semi-orththogonal
 

2085
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,589
Okay. So we have these semi-orththogonal
updates and semi-orththogonal updates in

2086
00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:55,599
updates and semi-orththogonal updates in
 

2087
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,510
updates and semi-orththogonal updates in
a sense are doing something that is

2088
00:55:59,510 --> 00:55:59,520
a sense are doing something that is
 

2089
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,230
a sense are doing something that is
similar to what we had talked about back

2090
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:02,240
similar to what we had talked about back
 

2091
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,829
similar to what we had talked about back
when we were talking about Adam right we

2092
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:03,839
when we were talking about Adam right we
 

2093
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,390
when we were talking about Adam right we
were saying that we want to be you know

2094
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:06,400
were saying that we want to be you know
 

2095
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,710
were saying that we want to be you know
not too motiv not not too moved by

2096
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:08,720
not too motiv not not too moved by
 

2097
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,829
not too motiv not not too moved by
particular singular values and so here

2098
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:11,839
particular singular values and so here
 

2099
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,069
particular singular values and so here
the semi-orththogonal update is kind of

2100
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:14,079
the semi-orththogonal update is kind of
 

2101
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,030
the semi-orththogonal update is kind of
like the sign of the

2102
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:17,040
like the sign of the
 

2103
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,990
like the sign of the
uh sign of the matrix right it's just

2104
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
uh sign of the matrix right it's just
 

2105
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,990
uh sign of the matrix right it's just
saying what are the dominant directions

2106
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:22,000
saying what are the dominant directions
 

2107
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,309
saying what are the dominant directions
without particularly scaling them and so

2108
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
without particularly scaling them and so
 

2109
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,910
without particularly scaling them and so
unv

2110
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:25,920
unv
 

2111
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,069
unv
u or uvranspose is capturing those

2112
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
u or uvranspose is capturing those
 

2113
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,069
u or uvranspose is capturing those
important directions of the matrix

2114
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:30,079
important directions of the matrix
 

2115
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,670
important directions of the matrix
without the singular values that are

2116
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
without the singular values that are
 

2117
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,870
without the singular values that are
associated with them. It's right saying

2118
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:32,880
associated with them. It's right saying
 

2119
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,150
associated with them. It's right saying
that all the singular values have now

2120
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:34,160
that all the singular values have now
 

2121
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,549
that all the singular values have now
been set to one. Right? So that's why

2122
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:36,559
been set to one. Right? So that's why
 

2123
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,069
been set to one. Right? So that's why
this is um this is in that in that same

2124
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:40,079
this is um this is in that in that same
 

2125
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,069
this is um this is in that in that same
spirit. It's it's it's coming all coming

2126
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:42,079
spirit. It's it's it's coming all coming
 

2127
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,710
spirit. It's it's it's coming all coming
from this the fact that the singular

2128
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:44,720
from this the fact that the singular
 

2129
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,430
from this the fact that the singular
values change how much you move in every

2130
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:47,440
values change how much you move in every
 

2131
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,349
values change how much you move in every
direction. Okay,

2132
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:51,359

 

2133
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,470

so now

2134
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:54,480
so now
 

2135
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,950
so now
let's come back to the RMS to RMS norm.

2136
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:56,960
let's come back to the RMS to RMS norm.
 

2137
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,349
let's come back to the RMS to RMS norm.
We talked about this uh last time a

2138
00:56:59,349 --> 00:56:59,359
We talked about this uh last time a
 

2139
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,549
We talked about this uh last time a
little bit, but instead of looking at

2140
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:02,559
little bit, but instead of looking at
 

2141
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,910
little bit, but instead of looking at
the two norm here, right? If instead I

2142
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:05,920
the two norm here, right? If instead I
 

2143
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,829
the two norm here, right? If instead I
looked at the RMS to RMS norm update,

2144
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:09,839
looked at the RMS to RMS norm update,
 

2145
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,829
looked at the RMS to RMS norm update,
well,

2146
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:11,839
well,
 

2147
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:14,069
well,
the calculation will be exactly the same

2148
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:14,079
the calculation will be exactly the same
 

2149
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,430
the calculation will be exactly the same
except I'm going to get this scaling

2150
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:15,440
except I'm going to get this scaling
 

2151
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,190
except I'm going to get this scaling
factor here, right? If I look at the RMS

2152
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:17,200
factor here, right? If I look at the RMS
 

2153
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,950
factor here, right? If I look at the RMS
to RMS induced norm instead of the true

2154
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:18,960
to RMS induced norm instead of the true
 

2155
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,870
to RMS induced norm instead of the true
norm because these are just related by

2156
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:20,880
norm because these are just related by
 

2157
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,789
norm because these are just related by
this constant scaling. And so if I do

2158
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:24,799
this constant scaling. And so if I do
 

2159
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,789
this constant scaling. And so if I do
the same optimization that I did for

2160
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:26,799
the same optimization that I did for
 

2161
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,950
the same optimization that I did for
shampoo, what I'm going to get is I'm

2162
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:28,960
shampoo, what I'm going to get is I'm
 

2163
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,950
shampoo, what I'm going to get is I'm
going to get this scaling factor out

2164
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:30,960
going to get this scaling factor out
 

2165
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,390
going to get this scaling factor out
here. Okay, everyone with me?

2166
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:36,400

 

2167
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,950

And this is basically the essence of

2168
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:38,960
And this is basically the essence of
 

2169
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,950
And this is basically the essence of
muon that you're getting at. Okay.

2170
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:44,960

 

2171
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,630

Instead of that spectral norm, we're

2172
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:46,640
Instead of that spectral norm, we're
 

2173
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,990
Instead of that spectral norm, we're
looking at the uh RMS norm.

2174
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:52,000

 

2175
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,829

This is idea one that I want to

2176
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:53,839
This is idea one that I want to
 

2177
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:56,150
This is idea one that I want to
communicate. This is key idea one of of

2178
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:56,160
communicate. This is key idea one of of
 

2179
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,430
communicate. This is key idea one of of
muan.

2180
00:57:59,430 --> 00:57:59,440

 

2181
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,190

It's the same idea as shampoo

2182
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:03,200
It's the same idea as shampoo
 

2183
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,950
It's the same idea as shampoo
except they didn't come at it happens to

2184
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:04,960
except they didn't come at it happens to
 

2185
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,710
except they didn't come at it happens to
be the same idea as shampoo.

2186
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:06,720
be the same idea as shampoo.
 

2187
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,069
be the same idea as shampoo.
Um, but what they're saying now here is

2188
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:10,079
Um, but what they're saying now here is
 

2189
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,829
Um, but what they're saying now here is
you want this scaling factor here as

2190
00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:11,839
you want this scaling factor here as
 

2191
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,789
you want this scaling factor here as
well to make sure that your updates are

2192
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:14,799
well to make sure that your updates are
 

2193
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:18,150
well to make sure that your updates are
of the same order and you're not uh that

2194
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:18,160
of the same order and you're not uh that
 

2195
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,150
of the same order and you're not uh that
you're that when you're moving through

2196
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,160
you're that when you're moving through
 

2197
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,910
you're that when you're moving through
your network things are not blowing up

2198
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:21,920
your network things are not blowing up
 

2199
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,470
your network things are not blowing up
or getting too small and that's where

2200
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:24,480
or getting too small and that's where
 

2201
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,710
or getting too small and that's where
this factor comes in.

2202
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:28,720
this factor comes in.
 

2203
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,309
this factor comes in.
Okay. So it's focusing on this RMS norm

2204
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:32,319
Okay. So it's focusing on this RMS norm
 

2205
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,030
Okay. So it's focusing on this RMS norm
perspective is key idea one that we want

2206
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:35,040
perspective is key idea one that we want
 

2207
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:45,829
perspective is key idea one that we want
to have. Uh

2208
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:45,839

 

2209
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,069

okay.

2210
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:48,079
okay.
 

2211
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:53,750
okay.
Okay. So now what's muon key idea 2?

2212
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:53,760
Okay. So now what's muon key idea 2?
 

2213
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,589
Okay. So now what's muon key idea 2?
Key idea too comes from the fact that

2214
00:58:55,589 --> 00:58:55,599
Key idea too comes from the fact that
 

2215
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,349
Key idea too comes from the fact that
well you know we've talked about UVRpose

2216
00:58:57,349 --> 00:58:57,359
well you know we've talked about UVRpose
 

2217
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:58,710
well you know we've talked about UVRpose
and we keep coming back to the same

2218
00:58:58,710 --> 00:58:58,720
and we keep coming back to the same
 

2219
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,750
and we keep coming back to the same
problem computing UVRpose is expensive

2220
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:01,760
problem computing UVRpose is expensive
 

2221
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,270
problem computing UVRpose is expensive
right because basically what we're

2222
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:03,280
right because basically what we're
 

2223
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,710
right because basically what we're
trying to do is we're trying to say well

2224
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,720
trying to do is we're trying to say well
 

2225
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,750
trying to do is we're trying to say well
well I have some matrix which is U sigma

2226
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:07,760
well I have some matrix which is U sigma
 

2227
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,589
well I have some matrix which is U sigma
vranspose and I want to just remove this

2228
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:09,599
vranspose and I want to just remove this
 

2229
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,990
vranspose and I want to just remove this
and I want to replace it with ones right

2230
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,000
and I want to replace it with ones right
 

2231
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,990
and I want to replace it with ones right
but to do that I need to compute what

2232
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:14,000
but to do that I need to compute what
 

2233
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,109
but to do that I need to compute what
that sigma is and that requires an SVD

2234
00:59:17,109 --> 00:59:17,119
that sigma is and that requires an SVD
 

2235
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,030
that sigma is and that requires an SVD
computation which is expensive I don't

2236
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:19,040
computation which is expensive I don't
 

2237
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,990
computation which is expensive I don't
want to be doing an SVD all the time

2238
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:22,000
want to be doing an SVD all the time
 

2239
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,589
want to be doing an SVD all the time
so what can I do to

2240
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:25,599
so what can I do to
 

2241
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,910
so what can I do to
get around this and that is the other

2242
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:27,920
get around this and that is the other
 

2243
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,030
get around this and that is the other
key innovation in muon. Okay.

2244
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:31,040
key innovation in muon. Okay.
 

2245
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,030
key innovation in muon. Okay.
And how muon does this is it does it

2246
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,040
And how muon does this is it does it
 

2247
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,670
And how muon does this is it does it
through two observations. Observation

2248
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:35,680
through two observations. Observation
 

2249
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:40,069
through two observations. Observation
one is that

2250
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:40,079

 

2251
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,630

semi-orththogonal updates are great but

2252
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:42,640
semi-orththogonal updates are great but
 

2253
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,950
semi-orththogonal updates are great but
if you're like almost semi-orththogonal

2254
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:44,960
if you're like almost semi-orththogonal
 

2255
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,510
if you're like almost semi-orththogonal
and you're just a little bit off

2256
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
and you're just a little bit off
 

2257
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,390
and you're just a little bit off
that still does pretty well.

2258
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:50,400
that still does pretty well.
 

2259
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,630
that still does pretty well.
And the second idea is through this uh

2260
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:54,640
And the second idea is through this uh
 

2261
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,710
And the second idea is through this uh
iterative update called Newton Schulz

2262
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:56,720
iterative update called Newton Schulz
 

2263
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,069
iterative update called Newton Schulz
iterations that I'm going to now talk

2264
00:59:58,069 --> 00:59:58,079
iterations that I'm going to now talk
 

2265
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,069
iterations that I'm going to now talk
about.

2266
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:00,079
about.
 

2267
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,030
about.
Okay, this Newton shells iteration is a

2268
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:03,040
Okay, this Newton shells iteration is a
 

2269
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,549
Okay, this Newton shells iteration is a
way of going from

2270
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:06,559
way of going from
 

2271
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,390
way of going from
U sigma vranspose to UVRpose in a

2272
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:10,400
U sigma vranspose to UVRpose in a
 

2273
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:17,190
U sigma vranspose to UVRpose in a
computationally efficient way.

2274
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:17,200

 

2275
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,870

So let's now talk about this. Okay.

2276
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:20,880
So let's now talk about this. Okay.
 

2277
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,470
So let's now talk about this. Okay.
Actually, does anyone have any ideas on

2278
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:22,480
Actually, does anyone have any ideas on
 

2279
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,549
Actually, does anyone have any ideas on
how they might want to do this? What

2280
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:24,559
how they might want to do this? What
 

2281
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,109
how they might want to do this? What
might be a strategy? Do you want a

2282
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:27,119
might be a strategy? Do you want a
 

2283
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,789
might be a strategy? Do you want a
minute to just think before I tell you

2284
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:28,799
minute to just think before I tell you
 

2285
01:00:28,799 --> 01:01:39,109
minute to just think before I tell you
the answer? Take a minute.

2286
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:39,119

 

2287
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,510

Okay, that's one minute. Anyone have any

2288
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
Okay, that's one minute. Anyone have any
 

2289
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,829
Okay, that's one minute. Anyone have any
ideas they want to share

2290
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:45,839
ideas they want to share
 

2291
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:54,230
ideas they want to share
or anything worth?

2292
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:54,240

 

2293
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,549

>> Okay. Well, okay. Let's just do it

2294
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:56,559
>> Okay. Well, okay. Let's just do it
 

2295
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,870
>> Okay. Well, okay. Let's just do it
together. This is hard.

2296
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:58,880
together. This is hard.
 

2297
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,589
together. This is hard.
But the the key observation is the idea

2298
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:03,599
But the the key observation is the idea
 

2299
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,190
But the the key observation is the idea
that

2300
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:05,200
that
 

2301
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,430
that
wouldn't it be great if I had some

2302
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:07,440
wouldn't it be great if I had some
 

2303
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,109
wouldn't it be great if I had some
function

2304
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:09,119
function
 

2305
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,109
function
if I had f of u

2306
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:13,119
if I had f of u
 

2307
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,510
if I had f of u
uh that looks like a v

2308
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:15,520
uh that looks like a v
 

2309
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,470
uh that looks like a v
u sigma vranspose and I could take this

2310
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
u sigma vranspose and I could take this
 

2311
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:26,309
u sigma vranspose and I could take this
function and outward pop uvranspose.

2312
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:26,319

 

2313
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:27,589

That would be great if I could find such

2314
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:27,599
That would be great if I could find such
 

2315
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,990
That would be great if I could find such
a function, right?

2316
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:30,000
a function, right?
 

2317
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,270
a function, right?
Okay. Well, in absence of finding such a

2318
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:33,280
Okay. Well, in absence of finding such a
 

2319
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,670
Okay. Well, in absence of finding such a
function, maybe I'd be happy with

2320
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:35,680
function, maybe I'd be happy with
 

2321
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,710
function, maybe I'd be happy with
something that's kind of approximately

2322
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
something that's kind of approximately
 

2323
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,069
something that's kind of approximately
equal, right?

2324
01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:42,079
equal, right?
 

2325
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,829
equal, right?
Or maybe I'd be happy with something

2326
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:43,839
Or maybe I'd be happy with something
 

2327
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:46,470
Or maybe I'd be happy with something
that I could have it's not exactly equal

2328
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:46,480
that I could have it's not exactly equal
 

2329
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,030
that I could have it's not exactly equal
to uvranspose, but if I keep iterating,

2330
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:49,040
to uvranspose, but if I keep iterating,
 

2331
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,990
to uvranspose, but if I keep iterating,
it will eventually converge to UVRpose,

2332
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:52,000
it will eventually converge to UVRpose,
 

2333
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,549
it will eventually converge to UVRpose,
right? So can I can I do something that

2334
01:02:54,549 --> 01:02:54,559
right? So can I can I do something that
 

2335
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,030
right? So can I can I do something that
will that can I find something that that

2336
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:57,040
will that can I find something that that
 

2337
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,670
will that can I find something that that
I can eventually get there? And so the

2338
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
I can eventually get there? And so the
 

2339
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,470
I can eventually get there? And so the
key observation in getting to this is

2340
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:02,480
key observation in getting to this is
 

2341
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,630
key observation in getting to this is
this idea that odd polomials commute

2342
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:06,640
this idea that odd polomials commute
 

2343
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,270
this idea that odd polomials commute
with the SVD. So what do I mean by an

2344
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:09,280
with the SVD. So what do I mean by an
 

2345
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,549
with the SVD. So what do I mean by an
odd polomial? I mean polomials that have

2346
01:03:12,549 --> 01:03:12,559
odd polomial? I mean polomials that have
 

2347
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:19,430
odd polomial? I mean polomials that have
only odd uh exponents. So you know x x

2348
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:19,440
only odd uh exponents. So you know x x
 

2349
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,950
only odd uh exponents. So you know x x
cubed x 5th x7th so on and so forth. So

2350
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960
cubed x 5th x7th so on and so forth. So
 

2351
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,549
cubed x 5th x7th so on and so forth. So
for example if I wanted to think about

2352
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:24,559
for example if I wanted to think about
 

2353
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,710
for example if I wanted to think about
an odd matrix polomial I would think of

2354
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:26,720
an odd matrix polomial I would think of
 

2355
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,470
an odd matrix polomial I would think of
something like this a kn * x1 plus a1 *

2356
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:30,480
something like this a kn * x1 plus a1 *
 

2357
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,789
something like this a kn * x1 plus a1 *
xxrpose x plus a2 * xxrpose 2 x so on

2358
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:34,799
xxrpose x plus a2 * xxrpose 2 x so on
 

2359
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,430
xxrpose x plus a2 * xxrpose 2 x so on
and so forth. This is making sure that I

2360
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:37,440
and so forth. This is making sure that I
 

2361
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,069
and so forth. This is making sure that I
only have odd degrees in my um

2362
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:42,079
only have odd degrees in my um
 

2363
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,829
only have odd degrees in my um
exponents.

2364
01:03:43,829 --> 01:03:43,839
exponents.
 

2365
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:46,230
exponents.
Okay? because here like this is one,

2366
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,240
Okay? because here like this is one,
 

2367
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,470
Okay? because here like this is one,
this is three, this is five, so on and

2368
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:48,480
this is three, this is five, so on and
 

2369
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,309
this is three, this is five, so on and
so forth.

2370
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:50,319
so forth.
 

2371
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:54,789
so forth.
Okay, this is 2 n plus one. Good. So

2372
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:54,799
Okay, this is 2 n plus one. Good. So
 

2373
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:58,230
Okay, this is 2 n plus one. Good. So
what's one example of this? Well, let's

2374
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:58,240
what's one example of this? Well, let's
 

2375
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,829
what's one example of this? Well, let's
look at this particular example because

2376
01:03:59,829 --> 01:03:59,839
look at this particular example because
 

2377
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,069
look at this particular example because
we're going to use it later.

2378
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:02,079
we're going to use it later.
 

2379
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,069
we're going to use it later.
Okay, so I have p of x is 3 over2x - 12

2380
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:06,079
Okay, so I have p of x is 3 over2x - 12
 

2381
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,829
Okay, so I have p of x is 3 over2x - 12
xrpose x. And now what I can do is I can

2382
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:09,839
xrpose x. And now what I can do is I can
 

2383
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,349
xrpose x. And now what I can do is I can
just substitute the svd in here. And as

2384
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
just substitute the svd in here. And as
 

2385
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,349
just substitute the svd in here. And as
always when you have these xxrposes all

2386
01:04:15,349 --> 01:04:15,359
always when you have these xxrposes all
 

2387
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,270
always when you have these xxrposes all
of the u's and v's like nicely cancel

2388
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:17,280
of the u's and v's like nicely cancel
 

2389
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,029
of the u's and v's like nicely cancel
out

2390
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:19,039
out
 

2391
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,870
out
and what I get here is now u * the same

2392
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:22,880
and what I get here is now u * the same
 

2393
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:28,870
and what I get here is now u * the same
polomial of sigma time vranspose

2394
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:28,880

 

2395
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,190

right and so

2396
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:31,200
right and so
 

2397
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,910
right and so
p of x is like you know it's it's like

2398
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:33,920
p of x is like you know it's it's like
 

2399
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,829
p of x is like you know it's it's like
the polomial is only operating on the

2400
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:35,839
the polomial is only operating on the
 

2401
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,470
the polomial is only operating on the
singular values

2402
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:38,480
singular values
 

2403
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,470
singular values
okay and this is true for all polomials.

2404
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:42,480
okay and this is true for all polomials.
 

2405
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,789
okay and this is true for all polomials.
So wouldn't it be great if I could find

2406
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:44,799
So wouldn't it be great if I could find
 

2407
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:49,109
So wouldn't it be great if I could find
some polomial that kind of over time if

2408
01:04:49,109 --> 01:04:49,119
some polomial that kind of over time if
 

2409
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,190
some polomial that kind of over time if
I could keep applying that polomial

2410
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,200
I could keep applying that polomial
 

2411
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,109
I could keep applying that polomial
and it would over time converge to one.

2412
01:04:55,109 --> 01:04:55,119
and it would over time converge to one.
 

2413
01:04:55,119 --> 01:05:00,309
and it would over time converge to one.
So for example if I have some

2414
01:05:00,309 --> 01:05:00,319

 

2415
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:06,630

uh p of x it's like u p of sigma

2416
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:06,640
uh p of x it's like u p of sigma
 

2417
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,789
uh p of x it's like u p of sigma
vranspose then I apply p of p of x and

2418
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:10,799
vranspose then I apply p of p of x and
 

2419
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:15,190
vranspose then I apply p of p of x and
it'll be u p of p of

2420
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:15,200
it'll be u p of p of
 

2421
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:19,029
it'll be u p of p of
sigma vranspose so on and so forth right

2422
01:05:19,029 --> 01:05:19,039
sigma vranspose so on and so forth right
 

2423
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,109
sigma vranspose so on and so forth right
because this commutes with the svd this

2424
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
because this commutes with the svd this
 

2425
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,750
because this commutes with the svd this
is what's happening so can I find a

2426
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:23,760
is what's happening so can I find a
 

2427
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,829
is what's happening so can I find a
polomial that has these nice properties.

2428
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:27,839
polomial that has these nice properties.
 

2429
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,270
polomial that has these nice properties.
Well, finding this everywhere is going

2430
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:29,280
Well, finding this everywhere is going
 

2431
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,109
Well, finding this everywhere is going
to be hard. But it turns out that this

2432
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:33,119
to be hard. But it turns out that this
 

2433
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,990
to be hard. But it turns out that this
polomial that we talked about over there

2434
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:36,000
polomial that we talked about over there
 

2435
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,510
polomial that we talked about over there
uh up up over here is exactly the is

2436
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:39,520
uh up up over here is exactly the is
 

2437
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,910
uh up up over here is exactly the is
does exactly that, right? And because

2438
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:41,920
does exactly that, right? And because
 

2439
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,829
does exactly that, right? And because
now that we've observed that

2440
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:45,839
now that we've observed that
 

2441
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:49,270
now that we've observed that
this polomial p of x essentially works

2442
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:49,280
this polomial p of x essentially works
 

2443
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,510
this polomial p of x essentially works
directly on the singular values, it's

2444
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:51,520
directly on the singular values, it's
 

2445
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,109
directly on the singular values, it's
enough for me to I don't need to think

2446
01:05:53,109 --> 01:05:53,119
enough for me to I don't need to think
 

2447
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,390
enough for me to I don't need to think
about a matrix valued polinomial

2448
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:54,400
about a matrix valued polinomial
 

2449
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,950
about a matrix valued polinomial
anymore. I can just think about how the

2450
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:56,960
anymore. I can just think about how the
 

2451
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,309
anymore. I can just think about how the
singular values themselves evolve when

2452
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:00,319
singular values themselves evolve when
 

2453
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,870
singular values themselves evolve when
the when I take when I when the polomial

2454
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:02,880
the when I take when I when the polomial
 

2455
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,069
the when I take when I when the polomial
acts on them essentially or when the

2456
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:04,079
acts on them essentially or when the
 

2457
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,430
acts on them essentially or when the
function acts on them, right? Because

2458
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:05,440
function acts on them, right? Because
 

2459
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,230
function acts on them, right? Because
now I have whatever it is I have sigma 1

2460
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:08,240
now I have whatever it is I have sigma 1
 

2461
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,069
now I have whatever it is I have sigma 1
sigma 2 sigma 3. I take the pol. just

2462
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:10,079
sigma 2 sigma 3. I take the pol. just
 

2463
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,309
sigma 2 sigma 3. I take the pol. just
taking the polomial of sigma 1, sigma 2,

2464
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:12,319
taking the polomial of sigma 1, sigma 2,
 

2465
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:16,309
taking the polomial of sigma 1, sigma 2,
sigma n, whatever it is. Okay.

2466
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:16,319
sigma n, whatever it is. Okay.
 

2467
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:18,950
sigma n, whatever it is. Okay.
So if I plot this function here now I've

2468
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:18,960
So if I plot this function here now I've
 

2469
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,069
So if I plot this function here now I've
plotted this here.

2470
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:22,079
plotted this here.
 

2471
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,270
plotted this here.
What do I have? Well,

2472
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:25,280
What do I have? Well,
 

2473
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,910
What do I have? Well,
what I have drawn here is this is the x=

2474
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:27,920
what I have drawn here is this is the x=
 

2475
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,309
what I have drawn here is this is the x=
to y line

2476
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:30,319
to y line
 

2477
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,589
to y line
and this is this cubic polomial.

2478
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:33,599
and this is this cubic polomial.
 

2479
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,549
and this is this cubic polomial.
Okay, it looks like a cubic. It has the

2480
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:36,559
Okay, it looks like a cubic. It has the
 

2481
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,589
Okay, it looks like a cubic. It has the
characteristic up down shape.

2482
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
characteristic up down shape.
 

2483
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,510
characteristic up down shape.
So what happens here now? Let's say I

2484
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:41,520
So what happens here now? Let's say I
 

2485
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,510
So what happens here now? Let's say I
start somewhere. Let me pick yellow is

2486
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:43,520
start somewhere. Let me pick yellow is
 

2487
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,190
start somewhere. Let me pick yellow is
actually a good color. So let's say I'm

2488
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:45,200
actually a good color. So let's say I'm
 

2489
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,349
actually a good color. So let's say I'm
somewhere here.

2490
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:47,359
somewhere here.
 

2491
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:50,069
somewhere here.
I start here. What happens to my

2492
01:06:50,069 --> 01:06:50,079
I start here. What happens to my
 

2493
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:53,829
I start here. What happens to my
function value

2494
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:53,839

 

2495
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:57,270

at point 2? My function my polomial

2496
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:57,280
at point 2? My function my polomial
 

2497
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,069
at point 2? My function my polomial
value is this point. Okay. So now what

2498
01:07:00,069 --> 01:07:00,079
value is this point. Okay. So now what
 

2499
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,910
value is this point. Okay. So now what
happens when I take this is the let's

2500
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:03,920
happens when I take this is the let's
 

2501
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,190
happens when I take this is the let's
call this 0.1 point 2.3.

2502
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:07,200
call this 0.1 point 2.3.
 

2503
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,950
call this 0.1 point 2.3.
Okay. I started at 0 2. I ended up at 3.

2504
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:10,960
Okay. I started at 0 2. I ended up at 3.
 

2505
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:16,390
Okay. I started at 0 2. I ended up at 3.
Now, what happens when I take P of 3.

2506
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:16,400
Now, what happens when I take P of 3.
 

2507
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,069
Now, what happens when I take P of 3.
Where am I going to end up? Well, I can

2508
01:07:18,069 --> 01:07:18,079
Where am I going to end up? Well, I can
 

2509
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:21,029
Where am I going to end up? Well, I can
do what is called a cobweb diagram. And

2510
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:21,039
do what is called a cobweb diagram. And
 

2511
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,349
do what is called a cobweb diagram. And
so, I go here. So, this is now 3. I'm

2512
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:23,359
so, I go here. So, this is now 3. I'm
 

2513
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,510
so, I go here. So, this is now 3. I'm
looking at 3 here. And what is the

2514
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:25,520
looking at 3 here. And what is the
 

2515
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,990
looking at 3 here. And what is the
function value here? Right now, this is

2516
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,000
function value here? Right now, this is
 

2517
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,829
function value here? Right now, this is
like 045.

2518
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:29,839
like 045.
 

2519
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,630
like 045.
Does everyone see how I'm like,

2520
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,640
Does everyone see how I'm like,
 

2521
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,309
Does everyone see how I'm like,
well, now if I wanted to see what was

2522
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:34,319
well, now if I wanted to see what was
 

2523
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,470
well, now if I wanted to see what was
the value at 045, well, I just go to the

2524
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,480
the value at 045, well, I just go to the
 

2525
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,349
the value at 045, well, I just go to the
x equal to y line. And now this is my

2526
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:39,359
x equal to y line. And now this is my
 

2527
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,069
x equal to y line. And now this is my
function value at 045.

2528
01:07:42,069 --> 01:07:42,079
function value at 045.
 

2529
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,430
function value at 045.
Now I apply P again, I'm going to end up

2530
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:45,440
Now I apply P again, I'm going to end up
 

2531
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,950
Now I apply P again, I'm going to end up
here.

2532
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:46,960
here.
 

2533
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,109
here.
I apply P again, I'm going to end up

2534
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:49,119
I apply P again, I'm going to end up
 

2535
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,750
I apply P again, I'm going to end up
here. I apply P again, I'm going to end

2536
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:51,760
here. I apply P again, I'm going to end
 

2537
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,349
here. I apply P again, I'm going to end
up here.

2538
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:55,359

 

2539
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:57,910

Converge to exactly

2540
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920
Converge to exactly
 

2541
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,069
Converge to exactly
one.

2542
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:00,079
one.
 

2543
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,870
one.
actually here.

2544
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:02,880
actually here.
 

2545
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,109
actually here.
Okay. So if I repeatedly apply

2546
01:08:07,109 --> 01:08:07,119
Okay. So if I repeatedly apply
 

2547
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:10,870
Okay. So if I repeatedly apply
my polomial to any value between zero

2548
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:10,880
my polomial to any value between zero
 

2549
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,230
my polomial to any value between zero
and one, I'm converging to one. Does

2550
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:14,240
and one, I'm converging to one. Does
 

2551
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,030
and one, I'm converging to one. Does
everyone see that? Just visually looking

2552
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:17,040
everyone see that? Just visually looking
 

2553
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,749
everyone see that? Just visually looking
at this.

2554
01:08:19,749 --> 01:08:19,759
at this.
 

2555
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,070
at this.
What if I started here?

2556
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:24,080

 

2557
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,309

Where would I converge to the same exact

2558
01:08:26,309 --> 01:08:26,319
Where would I converge to the same exact
 

2559
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,870
Where would I converge to the same exact
argument?

2560
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:28,880
argument?
 

2561
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,390
argument?
I'm going to converge here to negative

2562
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:30,400
I'm going to converge here to negative
 

2563
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,870
I'm going to converge here to negative
one. Right? Does this matter for us?

2564
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:32,880
one. Right? Does this matter for us?
 

2565
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,789
one. Right? Does this matter for us?
Does this part of the curve matter for

2566
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:34,799
Does this part of the curve matter for
 

2567
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,870
Does this part of the curve matter for
us

2568
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:36,880
us
 

2569
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,309
us
when we're thinking about singular

2570
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:38,319
when we're thinking about singular
 

2571
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,070
when we're thinking about singular
values? No. Our singular values are

2572
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:40,080
values? No. Our singular values are
 

2573
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,510
values? No. Our singular values are
always positive, right? So what we care

2574
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:41,520
always positive, right? So what we care
 

2575
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,470
always positive, right? So what we care
about really is what happens basically

2576
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:44,480
about really is what happens basically
 

2577
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,149
about really is what happens basically
in the positive part. Okay.

2578
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:48,159
in the positive part. Okay.
 

2579
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:50,950
in the positive part. Okay.
What happens if we start out somewhere

2580
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:50,960
What happens if we start out somewhere
 

2581
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,709
What happens if we start out somewhere
over here? Maybe here.

2582
01:08:54,709 --> 01:08:54,719
over here? Maybe here.
 

2583
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,550
over here? Maybe here.
Let's say my initial my value was over

2584
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
Let's say my initial my value was over
 

2585
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,749
Let's say my initial my value was over
here.

2586
01:08:59,749 --> 01:08:59,759

 

2587
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,990

Then what happens is I get bumped to

2588
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:02,000
Then what happens is I get bumped to
 

2589
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,789
Then what happens is I get bumped to
this line here and then I go up and then

2590
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
this line here and then I go up and then
 

2591
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,309
this line here and then I go up and then
I kind of convergent. So basically

2592
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:06,319
I kind of convergent. So basically
 

2593
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,149
I kind of convergent. So basically
there's a regime in which I get bumped

2594
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:08,159
there's a regime in which I get bumped
 

2595
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:10,630
there's a regime in which I get bumped
back in. You know even though I'm not

2596
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:10,640
back in. You know even though I'm not
 

2597
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,390
back in. You know even though I'm not
between 0 to one I'm being pulled back

2598
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:12,400
between 0 to one I'm being pulled back
 

2599
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,630
between 0 to one I'm being pulled back
in. So if I started say here somewhere

2600
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:14,640
in. So if I started say here somewhere
 

2601
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,910
in. So if I started say here somewhere
at even if I started at 1.5

2602
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:17,920
at even if I started at 1.5
 

2603
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,669
at even if I started at 1.5
go here

2604
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:19,679
go here
 

2605
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,990
go here
and I kind of converge in the same exact

2606
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:22,000
and I kind of converge in the same exact
 

2607
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,309
and I kind of converge in the same exact
pathway.

2608
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:26,319

2617

the negative side right because my

2638
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:56,960
and over again mean in this setting. So
 

2639
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,870
and over again mean in this setting. So
I have let's say I start at some P of

2640
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:00,880
I have let's say I start at some P of

I have let's say I start at some P of

then I'm going to get to one for some

2662
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:36,960
then I'm going to get to one for some
 

2663
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,270
then I'm going to get to one for some
cases of sigma. Right? So now the

2664
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:39,280
cases of sigma. Right? So now the
 

2665
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,630
cases of sigma. Right? So now the
question was well what happens if we

2666
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:40,640
question was well what happens if we
 

2667
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,430
question was well what happens if we
start at two. So now this is just a

2668
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:43,440
start at two. So now this is just a
 

2669
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,590
start at two. So now this is just a
zoomed out version of the same polomial.

2670
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:45,600
zoomed out version of the same polomial.
 

2671
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,310
zoomed out version of the same polomial.
this side zoomed in. But if I now zoom

2672
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:48,320
this side zoomed in. But if I now zoom
 

2673
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,030
this side zoomed in. But if I now zoom
out, well, clearly some places this

2674
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:51,040
out, well, clearly some places this
 

2675
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,350
out, well, clearly some places this
polomial is running away from me, right?

2676
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:53,360
polomial is running away from me, right?
 

2677
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,510
polomial is running away from me, right?
So if I had to start out somewhere here,

2678
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:55,520
So if I had to start out somewhere here,
 

2679
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,430
So if I had to start out somewhere here,
for example,

2680
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:57,440
for example,
 

2681
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,510
for example,
if I start at two, well, my function

2682
01:10:59,510 --> 01:10:59,520
if I start at two, well, my function
 

2683
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,669
if I start at two, well, my function
value is here. Now I bump to the x equal

2684
01:11:01,669 --> 01:11:01,679
value is here. Now I bump to the x equal
 

2685
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,910
value is here. Now I bump to the x equal
to y line. Maybe two is actually let me

2686
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:03,920
to y line. Maybe two is actually let me
 

2687
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,669
to y line. Maybe two is actually let me
start even further out. Let's start at

2688
01:11:05,669 --> 01:11:05,679
start even further out. Let's start at
 

2689
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,310
start even further out. Let's start at
three

2690
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:08,320
three
 

2691
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,590
three
or maybe just slightly past two to make

2692
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:11,600
or maybe just slightly past two to make
 

2693
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:23,830
or maybe just slightly past two to make
this easier for me to draw.

2694
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:23,840

 

2695
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,149

Then I'm going to bump here.

2696
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
Then I'm going to bump here.
 

2697
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,030
Then I'm going to bump here.
And I'm going to bump here.

2698
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
And I'm going to bump here.
 

2699
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:33,430
And I'm going to bump here.
Then I'm going to bump here.

2700
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:33,440

 

2701
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:46,310

Um, then I'm going to bump here.

2702
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:46,320

 

2703
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,390

then I'm going to bump here, here, here.

2704
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:48,400
then I'm going to bump here, here, here.
 

2705
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,910
then I'm going to bump here, here, here.
So I might still converge in this

2706
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920
So I might still converge in this
 

2707
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,189
So I might still converge in this
particular case, but if I start for

2708
01:11:53,189 --> 01:11:53,199
particular case, but if I start for
 

2709
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:56,709
particular case, but if I start for
example at four,

2710
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:56,719
example at four,
 

2711
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,550
example at four,
I'm going to go down. I'm going to go

2712
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:58,560
I'm going to go down. I'm going to go
 

2713
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,229
I'm going to go down. I'm going to go
out. I'm going to go out. I'm going to

2714
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:00,239
out. I'm going to go out. I'm going to
 

2715
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,229
out. I'm going to go out. I'm going to
out. This picture isn't showing it, but

2716
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:02,239
out. This picture isn't showing it, but
 

2717
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:04,229
out. This picture isn't showing it, but
I will eventually there like there's a

2718
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:04,239
I will eventually there like there's a
 

2719
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:05,990
I will eventually there like there's a
limit far enough where I will actually

2720
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:06,000
limit far enough where I will actually
 

2721
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,630
limit far enough where I will actually
diverge and and and flow out. Okay. So,

2722
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:08,640
diverge and and and flow out. Okay. So,
 

2723
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,149
diverge and and and flow out. Okay. So,
I'm going to show you this in another

2724
01:12:10,149 --> 01:12:10,159
I'm going to show you this in another
 

2725
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,030
I'm going to show you this in another
way.

2726
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,040
way.
 

2727
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,709
way.
Um, let's see.

2728
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:16,719
Um, let's see.
 

2729
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:20,630
Um, let's see.
So, okay. Here I have this. And let me

2730
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:20,640
So, okay. Here I have this. And let me
 

2731
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,630
So, okay. Here I have this. And let me
actually

2732
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:22,640
actually
 

2733
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,709
actually
I thought I'd save this, but okay. I

2734
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
I thought I'd save this, but okay. I
 

2735
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,390
I thought I'd save this, but okay. I
don't have it saved anyway. That's fine.

2736
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,400
don't have it saved anyway. That's fine.
 

2737
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,030
don't have it saved anyway. That's fine.
I'm going to define maybe it's easier

2738
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:31,040
I'm going to define maybe it's easier
 

2739
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:36,310
I'm going to define maybe it's easier
for me to type.

2740
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:36,320

 

2741
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:46,470

I have f of

2742
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:46,480

 

2743
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:53,510

f of x

2744
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:53,520

 

2745
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,030

=

2746
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:55,040
=
 

2747
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:00,950
=
3 / 2

2748
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:00,960

 

2749
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,550

x

2750
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:02,560
x
 

2751
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,229
x
-

2752
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:04,239
-
 

2753
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:10,790
-
1 divided by 2

2754
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:10,800

 

2755
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,630

x cubed. Okay. So this is my the same

2756
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:14,640
x cubed. Okay. So this is my the same
 

2757
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,510
x cubed. Okay. So this is my the same
thing that we plotted. Yes. Everyone

2758
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:17,520
thing that we plotted. Yes. Everyone
 

2759
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,910
thing that we plotted. Yes. Everyone
with me here? Okay. So now what happens

2760
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:19,920
with me here? Okay. So now what happens
 

2761
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,310
with me here? Okay. So now what happens
when I take f of

2762
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:24,320
when I take f of
 

2763
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,550
when I take f of
f of

2764
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560

 

2765
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,910

x? Uh

2766
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:33,920

 

2767
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,910

okay

2768
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:35,920
okay
 

2769
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,830
okay
so my this is this is what happens when

2770
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:37,840
so my this is this is what happens when
 

2771
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,550
so my this is this is what happens when
this is now the polomial applied twice

2772
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:40,560
this is now the polomial applied twice
 

2773
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,229
this is now the polomial applied twice
everyone see that okay now let me take f

2774
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:44,239
everyone see that okay now let me take f
 

2775
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,550
everyone see that okay now let me take f
of f

2776
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:46,560
of f
 

2777
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,550
of f
of f of x

2778
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:50,560
of f of x
 

2779
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,229
of f of x
okay you're kind of

2780
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:54,239
okay you're kind of
 

2781
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:57,990
okay you're kind of
getting uh closer and closer to being

2782
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:58,000
getting uh closer and closer to being
 

2783
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,830
getting uh closer and closer to being
flat at one right you basically are

2784
01:13:59,830 --> 01:13:59,840
flat at one right you basically are
 

2785
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,750
flat at one right you basically are
trying to in some sense approximate the

2786
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:01,760
trying to in some sense approximate the
 

2787
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,830
trying to in some sense approximate the
sign function.

2788
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:03,840
sign function.
 

2789
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,030
sign function.
How many times should I go f of f of f f

2790
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:07,040
How many times should I go f of f of f f
 

2791
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,270
How many times should I go f of f of f f
of f f of f f of f f f f f f f f f f f f

2792
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:09,280
of f f of f f of f f f f f f f f f f f f
 

2793
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,149
of f f of f f of f f f f f f f f f f f f
f f f f f f f f of f f f f f f f f f f f

2794
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:10,159
f f f f f f f f of f f f f f f f f f f f
 

2795
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:19,830
f f f f f f f f of f f f f f f f f f f f
f f f f f f f f f f f

2796
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:19,840

 

2797
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:25,030

off these other ones

2798
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:25,040

 

2799
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,750

is now really like it's basically

2800
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:27,760
is now really like it's basically
 

2801
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,510
is now really like it's basically
becoming like the sign function, right?

2802
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:29,520
becoming like the sign function, right?
 

2803
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,430
becoming like the sign function, right?
And so everything here is being mapped

2804
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:33,440
And so everything here is being mapped
 

2805
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,430
And so everything here is being mapped
up here

2806
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:35,440
up here
 

2807
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,430
up here
and everything here is being mapped down

2808
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:37,440
and everything here is being mapped down
 

2809
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,990
and everything here is being mapped down
here. And now there's a there's a regime

2810
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:40,000
here. And now there's a there's a regime
 

2811
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,750
here. And now there's a there's a regime
in which like if you're around two,

2812
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:41,760
in which like if you're around two,
 

2813
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,750
in which like if you're around two,
you're going to go to minus one, which

2814
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:43,760
you're going to go to minus one, which
 

2815
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,630
you're going to go to minus one, which
is you're converging to the wrong spot.

2816
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:46,640
is you're converging to the wrong spot.
 

2817
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,870
is you're converging to the wrong spot.
This is bad. And then there's a regime

2818
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:48,880
This is bad. And then there's a regime
 

2819
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,550
This is bad. And then there's a regime
here after which you're just blowing up

2820
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:50,560
here after which you're just blowing up
 

2821
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,390
here after which you're just blowing up
completely even if you're iteratively

2822
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:52,400
completely even if you're iteratively
 

2823
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,990
completely even if you're iteratively
applying it. But if you're within these

2824
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:56,000
applying it. But if you're within these
 

2825
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,510
applying it. But if you're within these
bounds

2826
01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:57,520
bounds
 

2827
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,910
bounds
and turns out that this is minus

2828
01:14:59,910 --> 01:14:59,920
and turns out that this is minus
 

2829
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,149
and turns out that this is minus
roo<unk>3 to plus roo<unk>3, you're

2830
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
roo<unk>3 to plus roo<unk>3, you're
 

2831
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:04,709
roo<unk>3 to plus roo<unk>3, you're
always converging to exactly one when

2832
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:04,719
always converging to exactly one when
 

2833
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:09,430
always converging to exactly one when
you start with a positive value. Okay,

2834
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:09,440
you start with a positive value. Okay,
 

2835
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,750
you start with a positive value. Okay,
great. Everyone sold on this?

2836
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:13,760
great. Everyone sold on this?
 

2837
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:19,830
great. Everyone sold on this?
Okay.

2838
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:19,840

 

2839
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,229

So what this means

2840
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:22,239
So what this means
 

2841
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,709
So what this means
is that by repeatedly applying this

2842
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:24,719
is that by repeatedly applying this
 

2843
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:28,950
is that by repeatedly applying this
polomial to our matrix what we can do is

2844
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:28,960
polomial to our matrix what we can do is
 

2845
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,070
polomial to our matrix what we can do is
we can approximate UV transpose because

2846
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:32,080
we can approximate UV transpose because
 

2847
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,870
we can approximate UV transpose because
it's as though the singular values are

2848
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:34,880
it's as though the singular values are
 

2849
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,669
it's as though the singular values are
just all becoming one.

2850
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:37,679
just all becoming one.
 

2851
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:40,950
just all becoming one.
Everyone see that?

2852
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:40,960
Everyone see that?
 

2853
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,950
Everyone see that?
So now we need to of course to have this

2854
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:42,960
So now we need to of course to have this
 

2855
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,229
So now we need to of course to have this
work we need to make sure that you

2856
01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:44,239
work we need to make sure that you
 

2857
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,070
work we need to make sure that you
initially start out in the right place

2858
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:46,080
initially start out in the right place
 

2859
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,669
initially start out in the right place
right if you start out if your singular

2860
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:47,679
right if you start out if your singular
 

2861
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:49,830
right if you start out if your singular
values are really large that's not going

2862
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:49,840
values are really large that's not going
 

2863
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,149
values are really large that's not going
to work you're going to blow up. So the

2864
01:15:52,149 --> 01:15:52,159
to work you're going to blow up. So the
 

2865
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:53,990
to work you're going to blow up. So the
trick that is applied in muon to make

2866
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:54,000
trick that is applied in muon to make
 

2867
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,910
trick that is applied in muon to make
sure that everything is actually

2868
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:55,920
sure that everything is actually
 

2869
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,669
sure that everything is actually
initialized properly is that you take

2870
01:15:57,669 --> 01:15:57,679
initialized properly is that you take
 

2871
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,590
initialized properly is that you take
your gradient and you normalize it by

2872
01:15:59,590 --> 01:15:59,600
your gradient and you normalize it by
 

2873
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,149
your gradient and you normalize it by
your frobinius norm.

2874
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:02,159
your frobinius norm.
 

2875
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:03,990
your frobinius norm.
Okay remember the frobinius norm is

2876
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:04,000
Okay remember the frobinius norm is
 

2877
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,390
Okay remember the frobinius norm is
always bigger than your uh spectral

2878
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:06,400
always bigger than your uh spectral
 

2879
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,590
always bigger than your uh spectral
norm. So it's always going to be larger

2880
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:07,600
norm. So it's always going to be larger
 

2881
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,950
norm. So it's always going to be larger
than your largest singular value. So

2882
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:08,960
than your largest singular value. So
 

2883
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,070
than your largest singular value. So
it's making sure that all of your

2884
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:10,080
it's making sure that all of your
 

2885
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,750
it's making sure that all of your
singular values are always smaller than

2886
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:11,760
singular values are always smaller than
 

2887
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,630
singular values are always smaller than
one.

2888
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:14,640
one.
 

2889
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,270
one.
Okay.

2890
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,280
Okay.
 

2891
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,590
Okay.
And this gives us basically what is muon

2892
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:19,600
And this gives us basically what is muon
 

2893
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,990
And this gives us basically what is muon
which is momentum orthogonalized by

2894
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:22,000
which is momentum orthogonalized by
 

2895
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,750
which is momentum orthogonalized by
Newton Schultz. That's where the mu

2896
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:25,760
Newton Schultz. That's where the mu
 

2897
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:31,350
Newton Schultz. That's where the mu
o n comes from.

2898
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:31,360

 

2899
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,189

And what you have is you have basically

2900
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,199
And what you have is you have basically
 

2901
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:37,110
And what you have is you have basically
a momentum style uh accumulation of the

2902
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:37,120
a momentum style uh accumulation of the
 

2903
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,070
a momentum style uh accumulation of the
gradient. So I do exactly this momentum

2904
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:40,080
gradient. So I do exactly this momentum
 

2905
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,470
gradient. So I do exactly this momentum
like uh

2906
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480
like uh
 

2907
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,110
like uh
calculation

2908
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:45,120
calculation
 

2909
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,350
calculation
and then I take it and I compute the

2910
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:49,360
and then I take it and I compute the
 

2911
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,070
and then I take it and I compute the
orth semi-orgthogonalization of it by

2912
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:52,080
orth semi-orgthogonalization of it by
 

2913
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,270
orth semi-orgthogonalization of it by
using Newton Schultz. So I iterate

2914
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:55,280
using Newton Schultz. So I iterate
 

2915
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,110
using Newton Schultz. So I iterate
Newton Schultz. Typically there's a

2916
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
Newton Schultz. Typically there's a
 

2917
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:01,030
Newton Schultz. Typically there's a
parameter in uh I think five is what is

2918
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,040
parameter in uh I think five is what is
 

2919
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,270
parameter in uh I think five is what is
used in the first implementation of muon

2920
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:03,280
used in the first implementation of muon
 

2921
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,990
used in the first implementation of muon
and there's been going much beyond five

2922
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:06,000
and there's been going much beyond five
 

2923
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,350
and there's been going much beyond five
doesn't seem to help for the particular

2924
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:07,360
doesn't seem to help for the particular
 

2925
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:11,590
doesn't seem to help for the particular
polomials they have chosen um

2926
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:11,600
polomials they have chosen um
 

2927
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,990
polomials they have chosen um
and then what you get oops this is a

2928
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:14,000
and then what you get oops this is a
 

2929
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,630
and then what you get oops this is a
typo here this should be

2930
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:16,640
typo here this should be
 

2931
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,550
typo here this should be
uh

2932
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:20,560

 

2933
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,430

and then what you get is

2934
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:23,440
and then what you get is
 

2935
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,189
and then what you get is
that is the update you apply

2936
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:27,199

 

2937
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,910

Okay,

2938
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:29,920
Okay,
 

2939
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,669
Okay,
everyone with me, this is muan. Okay. So

2940
01:17:33,669 --> 01:17:33,679
everyone with me, this is muan. Okay. So
 

2941
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,270
everyone with me, this is muan. Okay. So
now of course there's a lot of questions

2942
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:35,280
now of course there's a lot of questions
 

2943
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,470
now of course there's a lot of questions
about how do you choose this PFX and the

2944
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:38,480
about how do you choose this PFX and the
 

2945
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,110
about how do you choose this PFX and the
other key idea that the authors of Muan

2946
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:41,120
other key idea that the authors of Muan
 

2947
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,270
other key idea that the authors of Muan
or the inventors of Muan brought about

2948
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:43,280
or the inventors of Muan brought about
 

2949
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,030
or the inventors of Muan brought about
is that you can actually you know I did

2950
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:45,040
is that you can actually you know I did
 

2951
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,590
is that you can actually you know I did
this for one particular PFX but you can

2952
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:47,600
this for one particular PFX but you can
 

2953
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,310
this for one particular PFX but you can
choose a polomial that gives you

2954
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:50,320
choose a polomial that gives you
 

2955
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,870
choose a polomial that gives you
particular performance characteristics.

2956
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:52,880
particular performance characteristics.
 

2957
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,790
particular performance characteristics.
Maybe you compare about compare care

2958
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:54,800
Maybe you compare about compare care
 

2959
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,310
Maybe you compare about compare care
more about one thing or another. So for

2960
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:56,320
more about one thing or another. So for
 

2961
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,189
more about one thing or another. So for
example one observation is that if you

2962
01:17:59,189 --> 01:17:59,199
example one observation is that if you
 

2963
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:01,590
example one observation is that if you
have a higher order polomial it might

2964
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:01,600
have a higher order polomial it might
 

2965
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,630
have a higher order polomial it might
converge faster but that means that you

2966
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:04,640
converge faster but that means that you
 

2967
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,070
converge faster but that means that you
have to do more matrix multiplications

2968
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:06,080
have to do more matrix multiplications
 

2969
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,070
have to do more matrix multiplications
to compute that polomial right so

2970
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:08,080
to compute that polomial right so
 

2971
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,590
to compute that polomial right so
there's a trade-off like faster

2972
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:09,600
there's a trade-off like faster
 

2973
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,910
there's a trade-off like faster
convergence versus more computation

2974
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:11,920
convergence versus more computation
 

2975
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,990
convergence versus more computation
depending on which you care about you

2976
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:14,000
depending on which you care about you
 

2977
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,669
depending on which you care about you
can choose different things and there's

2978
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:15,679
can choose different things and there's
 

2979
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:18,149
can choose different things and there's
been multiple explorations that people

2980
01:18:18,149 --> 01:18:18,159
been multiple explorations that people
 

2981
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:21,270
been multiple explorations that people
have done to kind of figure out what the

2982
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:21,280
have done to kind of figure out what the
 

2983
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,750
have done to kind of figure out what the
appropriate or or that people are doing

2984
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:23,760
appropriate or or that people are doing
 

2985
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,110
appropriate or or that people are doing
it's not even have done people are

2986
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:25,120
it's not even have done people are
 

2987
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,270
it's not even have done people are
currently exploring how to figure out

2988
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:27,280
currently exploring how to figure out
 

2989
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,830
currently exploring how to figure out
what the right polomial is and in

2990
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:29,840
what the right polomial is and in
 

2991
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,669
what the right polomial is and in
particular in the uh nano GPT speedrun

2992
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:33,679
particular in the uh nano GPT speedrun
 

2993
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,630
particular in the uh nano GPT speedrun
the record that muan initially set this

2994
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:36,640
the record that muan initially set this
 

2995
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,669
the record that muan initially set this
is the polomial that they used okay so

2996
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:39,679
is the polomial that they used okay so
 

2997
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,070
is the polomial that they used okay so
it's a quintic polomial

2998
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:42,080
it's a quintic polomial
 

2999
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,350
it's a quintic polomial
and you might notice something

3000
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:43,360
and you might notice something
 

3001
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,189
and you might notice something
interesting about this so here I plotted

3002
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:45,199
interesting about this so here I plotted
 

3003
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:48,709
interesting about this so here I plotted
basically uh this red line is what that

3004
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:48,719
basically uh this red line is what that
 

3005
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:51,590
basically uh this red line is what that
uh quintic polomial looks like and this

3006
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:51,600
uh quintic polomial looks like and this
 

3007
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,430
uh quintic polomial looks like and this
is the quintic polomial applied to

3008
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:53,440
is the quintic polomial applied to
 

3009
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,350
is the quintic polomial applied to
itself I don't know five or eight times

3010
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:55,360
itself I don't know five or eight times
 

3011
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,790
itself I don't know five or eight times
I forget exactly how many I did.

3012
01:18:58,790 --> 01:18:58,800
I forget exactly how many I did.
 

3013
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,990
I forget exactly how many I did.
But this is not converging, right?

3014
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:02,000
But this is not converging, right?
 

3015
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,669
But this is not converging, right?
This does not look like a nice straight

3016
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:03,679
This does not look like a nice straight
 

3017
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,669
This does not look like a nice straight
line. It's looking like it's kind of

3018
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:05,679
line. It's looking like it's kind of
 

3019
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,070
line. It's looking like it's kind of
jagged all over.

3020
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:08,080
jagged all over.
 

3021
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,790
jagged all over.
But turns out that okay, so if you apply

3022
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:10,800
But turns out that okay, so if you apply
 

3023
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,990
But turns out that okay, so if you apply
this, this polomial is not really

3024
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:14,000
this, this polomial is not really
 

3025
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,669
this, this polomial is not really
converging to one. So all it's doing is

3026
01:19:15,669 --> 01:19:15,679
converging to one. So all it's doing is
 

3027
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:16,870
converging to one. So all it's doing is
it's doing an approximate

3028
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:16,880
it's doing an approximate
 

3029
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,550
it's doing an approximate
semi-orgthogonalization.

3030
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:18,560
semi-orgthogonalization.
 

3031
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,350
semi-orgthogonalization.
If it turns out that this is the right

3032
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:21,360
If it turns out that this is the right
 

3033
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,950
If it turns out that this is the right
this works really well even though

3034
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:22,960
this works really well even though
 

3035
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,390
this works really well even though
you're not exactly setting all the

3036
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:24,400
you're not exactly setting all the
 

3037
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,990
you're not exactly setting all the
singular values to one. They're kind of

3038
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:26,000
singular values to one. They're kind of
 

3039
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,750
singular values to one. They're kind of
in the neighborhood of one.

3040
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:29,760
in the neighborhood of one.
 

3041
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,590
in the neighborhood of one.
The reason that they chose this that was

3042
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:31,600
The reason that they chose this that was
 

3043
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,270
The reason that they chose this that was
that they found that this converged

3044
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:33,280
that they found that this converged
 

3045
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,870
that they found that this converged
faster. And one of the key things that

3046
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:34,880
faster. And one of the key things that
 

3047
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,590
faster. And one of the key things that
they observed was uh for faster

3048
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:37,600
they observed was uh for faster
 

3049
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,750
they observed was uh for faster
convergence was basically you want this

3050
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:39,760
convergence was basically you want this
 

3051
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,149
convergence was basically you want this
first coefficient the coefficient of x

3052
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:42,159
first coefficient the coefficient of x
 

3053
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:43,990
first coefficient the coefficient of x
to be as large as possible because that

3054
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:44,000
to be as large as possible because that
 

3055
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,470
to be as large as possible because that
is what sets the slope at zero to be

3056
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:46,480
is what sets the slope at zero to be
 

3057
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,709
is what sets the slope at zero to be
large. And the most important thing what

3058
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:48,719
large. And the most important thing what
 

3059
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,390
large. And the most important thing what
they found was that it's really

3060
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,400
they found was that it's really
 

3061
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,070
they found was that it's really
important to get these small singular

3062
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:52,080
important to get these small singular
 

3063
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,229
important to get these small singular
values to scale up fast because those

3064
01:19:54,229 --> 01:19:54,239
values to scale up fast because those
 

3065
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:55,990
values to scale up fast because those
are what are bottlenecking performance

3066
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:56,000
are what are bottlenecking performance
 

3067
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,149
are what are bottlenecking performance
was just the empirical observation and

3068
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159
was just the empirical observation and
 

3069
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,390
was just the empirical observation and
so this empirically was found to do

3070
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:00,400
so this empirically was found to do
 

3071
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,790
so this empirically was found to do
well. If you observe if you just compute

3072
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:02,800
well. If you observe if you just compute
 

3073
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,030
well. If you observe if you just compute
f of one here

3074
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,040
f of one here
 

3075
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,229
f of one here
which is just the sum of the

3076
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
which is just the sum of the
 

3077
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:09,590
which is just the sum of the
coefficients this is not equal to one.

3078
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:09,600
coefficients this is not equal to one.
 

3079
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,350
coefficients this is not equal to one.
So that means that this is not going to

3080
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:11,360
So that means that this is not going to
 

3081
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,110
So that means that this is not going to
converge to one right there's no way for

3082
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:13,120
converge to one right there's no way for
 

3083
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,790
converge to one right there's no way for
it because f of one is not one.

3084
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:16,800
it because f of one is not one.
 

3085
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,669
it because f of one is not one.
So what they did was they sacrificed

3086
01:20:19,669 --> 01:20:19,679
So what they did was they sacrificed
 

3087
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:22,070
So what they did was they sacrificed
convergence for speed and it still

3088
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080
convergence for speed and it still
 

3089
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,110
convergence for speed and it still
works. Okay. So you don't necessarily

3090
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:25,120
works. Okay. So you don't necessarily
 

3091
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,510
works. Okay. So you don't necessarily
have to have the uh theoretically

3092
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,520
have to have the uh theoretically
 

3093
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,270
have to have the uh theoretically
guaranteed. You know this theoretical

3094
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:29,280
guaranteed. You know this theoretical
 

3095
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,790
guaranteed. You know this theoretical
guarantee is great to start thinking

3096
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:30,800
guarantee is great to start thinking
 

3097
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,630
guarantee is great to start thinking
about things but this was not what was

3098
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:32,640
about things but this was not what was
 

3099
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,830
about things but this was not what was
actually used in the in the

3100
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:33,840
actually used in the in the
 

3101
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,590
actually used in the in the
implementation. Since then there have

3102
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:35,600
implementation. Since then there have
 

3103
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,510
implementation. Since then there have
been better polomials that have that

3104
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:37,520
been better polomials that have that
 

3105
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,950
been better polomials that have that
have been developed. This is not the

3106
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:38,960
have been developed. This is not the
 

3107
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,189
have been developed. This is not the
best one out there. Uh some of which

3108
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:41,199
best one out there. Uh some of which
 

3109
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:44,229
best one out there. Uh some of which
actually do have convergence guarantees.

3110
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:44,239
actually do have convergence guarantees.
 

3111
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:55,189
actually do have convergence guarantees.
Okay, question at the back.

3112
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:55,199

 

3113
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:55,750

>> Yes.

3114
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:55,760
>> Yes.
 

3115
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,270
>> Yes.
>> Otherwise,

3116
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:57,280
>> Otherwise,
 

3117
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,030
>> Otherwise,
>> well, the thing is that we can we can

3118
01:20:59,030 --> 01:20:59,040
>> well, the thing is that we can we can
 

3119
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,590
>> well, the thing is that we can we can
satisfy them for free by doing this

3120
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:01,600
satisfy them for free by doing this
 

3121
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,550
satisfy them for free by doing this
normalization because this normalization

3122
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:04,560
normalization because this normalization
 

3123
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,149
normalization because this normalization
will automatically map all of the

3124
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:06,159
will automatically map all of the
 

3125
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,390
will automatically map all of the
singular rel to be smaller than one and

3126
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:08,400
singular rel to be smaller than one and
 

3127
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,310
singular rel to be smaller than one and
by div I'm not actually changing the

3128
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,320
by div I'm not actually changing the
 

3129
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,070
by div I'm not actually changing the
semi-arthogonalization because this is

3130
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:12,080
semi-arthogonalization because this is
 

3131
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,070
semi-arthogonalization because this is
just a scaling

3132
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,080
just a scaling
 

3133
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,149
just a scaling
So it won't actually matter. So I'll

3134
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:16,159
So it won't actually matter. So I'll
 

3135
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:17,430
So it won't actually matter. So I'll
answer the question just could be one

3136
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:17,440
answer the question just could be one
 

3137
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,430
answer the question just could be one
thing. So this is basically the last

3138
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:19,440
thing. So this is basically the last
 

3139
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,030
thing. So this is basically the last
lecture that we're doing in this series

3140
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:21,040
lecture that we're doing in this series
 

3141
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:25,750
lecture that we're doing in this series
of optimizers for deep learning. Um what

3142
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:25,760
of optimizers for deep learning. Um what
 

3143
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,669
of optimizers for deep learning. Um what
we've tried to do is give you a sense

3144
01:21:27,669 --> 01:21:27,679
we've tried to do is give you a sense
 

3145
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:31,030
we've tried to do is give you a sense
and a flavor of how these new optimizers

3146
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:31,040
and a flavor of how these new optimizers
 

3147
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,350
and a flavor of how these new optimizers
that are going beyond Adam and ADUW are

3148
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:33,360
that are going beyond Adam and ADUW are
 

3149
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,189
that are going beyond Adam and ADUW are
really working so that you can basically

3150
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:35,199
really working so that you can basically
 

3151
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:37,669
really working so that you can basically
be upto-date and current with the field.

3152
01:21:37,669 --> 01:21:37,679
be upto-date and current with the field.
 

3153
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:40,630
be upto-date and current with the field.
This is all active research. You know,

3154
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:40,640
This is all active research. You know,
 

3155
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,070
This is all active research. You know,
one of the things for example that is

3156
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:42,080
one of the things for example that is
 

3157
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,390
one of the things for example that is
really important about muon is that the

3158
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:44,400
really important about muon is that the
 

3159
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,030
really important about muon is that the
batch size of muon really matters and

3160
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040
batch size of muon really matters and
 

3161
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,590
batch size of muon really matters and
bigger batch sizes are better for muan

3162
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:49,600
bigger batch sizes are better for muan
 

3163
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,350
bigger batch sizes are better for muan
empirically observed. There's no proofs

3164
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:51,360
empirically observed. There's no proofs
 

3165
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,910
empirically observed. There's no proofs
of any of these things because basically

3166
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:53,920
of any of these things because basically
 

3167
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,030
of any of these things because basically
it leads to more stable gradients. Uh so

3168
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:57,040
it leads to more stable gradients. Uh so
 

3169
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,189
it leads to more stable gradients. Uh so
that's one observation for muan. There's

3170
01:21:59,189 --> 01:21:59,199
that's one observation for muan. There's
 

3171
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,709
that's one observation for muan. There's
other papers out there that are showing

3172
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:00,719
other papers out there that are showing
 

3173
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,030
other papers out there that are showing
that in certain regimes certain other

3174
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:03,040
that in certain regimes certain other
 

3175
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,390
that in certain regimes certain other
variations on muon. Uh so there's like

3176
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:06,400
variations on muon. Uh so there's like
 

3177
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,830
variations on muon. Uh so there's like
scion and prawn and I don't know there's

3178
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:09,840
scion and prawn and I don't know there's
 

3179
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,270
scion and prawn and I don't know there's
there's there's many many other

3180
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:11,280
there's there's many many other
 

3181
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,149
there's there's many many other
variations that uh outperform in certain

3182
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:14,159
variations that uh outperform in certain
 

3183
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:16,390
variations that uh outperform in certain
regimes versus others. There's critiques

3184
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:16,400
regimes versus others. There's critiques
 

3185
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,310
regimes versus others. There's critiques
of those papers that say that well

3186
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:18,320
of those papers that say that well
 

3187
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,310
of those papers that say that well
actually the batch sizes were not

3188
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:20,320
actually the batch sizes were not
 

3189
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,830
actually the batch sizes were not
optimized or the hyperparameters were

3190
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:21,840
optimized or the hyperparameters were
 

3191
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,270
optimized or the hyperparameters were
not optimized the right way. So it's

3192
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:25,280
not optimized the right way. So it's
 

3193
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,750
not optimized the right way. So it's
important to note that identifying the

3194
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:27,760
important to note that identifying the
 

3195
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,830
important to note that identifying the
best optimizer is a pretty tricky thing

3196
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:29,840
best optimizer is a pretty tricky thing
 

3197
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,750
best optimizer is a pretty tricky thing
because it all depends on the tuning of

3198
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:31,760
because it all depends on the tuning of
 

3199
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,830
because it all depends on the tuning of
the hyperparameters, right? And so

3200
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:33,840
the hyperparameters, right? And so
 

3201
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,270
the hyperparameters, right? And so
saying that this optimizer is better

3202
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:35,280
saying that this optimizer is better
 

3203
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,870
saying that this optimizer is better
than that requires you to do a full

3204
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:36,880
than that requires you to do a full
 

3205
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,709
than that requires you to do a full
hyperparameter sweep sweep for this

3206
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:38,719
hyperparameter sweep sweep for this
 

3207
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,189
hyperparameter sweep sweep for this
optimizer, full hyperparameter sweep for

3208
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:41,199
optimizer, full hyperparameter sweep for
 

3209
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:42,950
optimizer, full hyperparameter sweep for
that optimizer and identify the best

3210
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:42,960
that optimizer and identify the best
 

3211
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,790
that optimizer and identify the best
hyperpar parameters for each. There was

3212
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:44,800
hyperpar parameters for each. There was
 

3213
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,470
hyperpar parameters for each. There was
like kind of this kind understanding

3214
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:46,480
like kind of this kind understanding
 

3215
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,629
like kind of this kind understanding
that said that oh just use the

3216
01:22:48,629 --> 01:22:48,639
that said that oh just use the
 

3217
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:49,990
that said that oh just use the
hyperparameters for one optimizer for

3218
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:50,000
hyperparameters for one optimizer for
 

3219
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,110
hyperparameters for one optimizer for
the other optimizer. They're probably

3220
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:51,120
the other optimizer. They're probably
 

3221
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,430
the other optimizer. They're probably
all the same. That's not that's not

3222
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:53,440
all the same. That's not that's not
 

3223
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,709
all the same. That's not that's not
true. You have to optimize them

3224
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:54,719
true. You have to optimize them
 

3225
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,030
true. You have to optimize them
individually. So

3226
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
individually. So
 

3227
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,870
individually. So
there's a ton of work out there. This is

3228
01:22:58,870 --> 01:22:58,880
there's a ton of work out there. This is
 

3229
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,709
there's a ton of work out there. This is
a very active research area. We will

3230
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:00,719
a very active research area. We will
 

3231
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,189
a very active research area. We will
probably be having some projects that

3232
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:03,199
probably be having some projects that
 

3233
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:06,149
probably be having some projects that
you can do to build on this. Um, but

3234
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:06,159
you can do to build on this. Um, but
 

3235
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:09,030
you can do to build on this. Um, but
because this is so current, uh, we're we

3236
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,040
because this is so current, uh, we're we
 

3237
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,790
because this is so current, uh, we're we
we will have these projects. That's also

3238
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:10,800
we will have these projects. That's also
 

3239
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,030
we will have these projects. That's also
the reason that we have these, uh,

3240
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:13,040
the reason that we have these, uh,
 

3241
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,629
the reason that we have these, uh,
extra, uh, what are we calling them?

3242
01:23:14,629 --> 01:23:14,639
extra, uh, what are we calling them?
 

3243
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:17,189
extra, uh, what are we calling them?
Participation credit, uh, opportunities

3244
01:23:17,189 --> 01:23:17,199
Participation credit, uh, opportunities
 

3245
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:19,750
Participation credit, uh, opportunities
that require you to kind of go in and

3246
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:19,760
that require you to kind of go in and
 

3247
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,750
that require you to kind of go in and
and play with some of these optimizers.

3248
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:21,760
and play with some of these optimizers.
 

3249
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,350
and play with some of these optimizers.
Okay, I know there's a bunch of

3250
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:23,360
Okay, I know there's a bunch of
 

3251
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,270
Okay, I know there's a bunch of
questions, so I'll hang out here and we

3252
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:25,280
questions, so I'll hang out here and we
 

3253
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,870
questions, so I'll hang out here and we
can walk to office hours, but we're at

3254
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:26,880
can walk to office hours, but we're at
 

3255
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:36,470
can walk to office hours, but we're at
time. Thank you very much.

3256
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480

 

3257
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,280

Yes, I will post.
