1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,990

language models. There's many that are

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,000
language models. There's many that are
 

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,510
language models. There's many that are
supported and so

4
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:03,520
supported and so
 

5
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,470
supported and so
>> came out last week.

6
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:04,480
>> came out last week.
 

7
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,590
>> came out last week.
>> The Yeah, the

8
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:05,600
>> The Yeah, the
 

9
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,269
>> The Yeah, the
>> Yeah, the API came out, you know, like

10
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:07,279
>> Yeah, the API came out, you know, like
 

11
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,350
>> Yeah, the API came out, you know, like
in a very short time ago. So, it's very

12
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
in a very short time ago. So, it's very
 

13
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,950
in a very short time ago. So, it's very
very new. Uh and

14
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
very new. Uh and
 

15
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,829
very new. Uh and
so I think we we can get people $250 of

16
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:15,839
so I think we we can get people $250 of
 

17
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,070
so I think we we can get people $250 of
credit per student. Uh so for a group of

18
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,080
credit per student. Uh so for a group of
 

19
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,710
credit per student. Uh so for a group of
four, this is $1,000 of credit that you

20
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
four, this is $1,000 of credit that you
 

21
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,830
four, this is $1,000 of credit that you
can have um using Tinker. So I strongly

22
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
can have um using Tinker. So I strongly
 

23
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,109
can have um using Tinker. So I strongly
recommend people if you can find ways of

24
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,119
recommend people if you can find ways of
 

25
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,349
recommend people if you can find ways of

but it's it's not as convenient at all.

52
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
but it's it's not as convenient at all.
 

53
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,910
but it's it's not as convenient at all.
Um but it's general purpose.

Um but it's general purpose.
 

55
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,550
Um but it's general purpose.
Okay. So very important be on it. Uh use

56
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
Okay. So very important be on it. Uh use
 

57
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,630
Okay. So very important be on it. Uh use
use all the compute you can you can uh

58
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
use all the compute you can you can uh
 

59
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,270
use all the compute you can you can uh
to do your do your projects because you

60
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
to do your do your projects because you
 

61
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,950
to do your do your projects because you
can iterate.

62
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
can iterate.
 

63
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,990
can iterate.
Okay. So now the topic I want to kind of

64
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay. So now the topic I want to kind of
 

65
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,390
Okay. So now the topic I want to kind of
move towards is I want to talk about a

66
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
move towards is I want to talk about a
 

67
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,789
move towards is I want to talk about a
little bit about in context learning and

68
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
little bit about in context learning and
 

69
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,870
little bit about in context learning and
prompting which you've all heard about

70
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:30,880
prompting which you've all heard about
 

71
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,789
prompting which you've all heard about
at least the prompting part uh but sort

72
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
at least the prompting part uh but sort
 

73
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,069
at least the prompting part uh but sort
of connected to what we've been talking

74
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
of connected to what we've been talking
 

75
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,749
of connected to what we've been talking
about a little bit.

76
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
about a little bit.
 

77
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,830
about a little bit.
And then we'll start into discussions of

78
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
And then we'll start into discussions of
 

79
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,310
And then we'll start into discussions of
fine-tuning. And this is going to be the

80
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,320
fine-tuning. And this is going to be the
 

81
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,429
fine-tuning. And this is going to be the
topic of uh this lecture and uh the next

82
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
topic of uh this lecture and uh the next
 

83
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,710
topic of uh this lecture and uh the next
lecture. But we're going to kind of keep

84
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:44,720
lecture. But we're going to kind of keep
 

85
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,630
lecture. But we're going to kind of keep
keep building.

86
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
keep building.
 

87
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,950
keep building.
So I'm going to start with just recall

88
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
So I'm going to start with just recall
 

89
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,950
So I'm going to start with just recall
how pre-training works. Here's like a

90
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
how pre-training works. Here's like a
 

91
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,670
how pre-training works. Here's like a
full picture of pre-training for these

92
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
full picture of pre-training for these
 

93
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,789
full picture of pre-training for these
GPG style models. So recall you have a

94
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
GPG style models. So recall you have a
 

95
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,990
GPG style models. So recall you have a
model. The model has different parts. So

96
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
model. The model has different parts. So
 

97
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,830
model. The model has different parts. So
you have discrete tokens that this thing

98
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
you have discrete tokens that this thing
 

99
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,990
you have discrete tokens that this thing
deals with. It can also be continuous

100
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
deals with. It can also be continuous
 

101
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,590
deals with. It can also be continuous
tokens. You can also think about things

102
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
tokens. You can also think about things
 

103
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,070
tokens. You can also think about things
with continuous inputs. We pointed to a

104
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
with continuous inputs. We pointed to a
 

105
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,350
with continuous inputs. We pointed to a
paper for projects that did that.

106
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
paper for projects that did that.
 

107
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,869
paper for projects that did that.
But you know, let's think of a discrete

108
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
But you know, let's think of a discrete
 

109
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,630
But you know, let's think of a discrete
case.

110
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
case.
 

111
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,830
case.
And so these tokens have to get

112
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
And so these tokens have to get
 

113
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,350
And so these tokens have to get
converted into embedding somehow. They

114
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
converted into embedding somehow. They
 

115
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,470
converted into embedding somehow. They
go through an embedder and all the boxes

116
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
go through an embedder and all the boxes
 

117
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,630
go through an embedder and all the boxes
uh here are learned. So and then after

118
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
uh here are learned. So and then after
 

119
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,910
uh here are learned. So and then after
it goes to the embedter, you're now in

120
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
it goes to the embedter, you're now in
 

121
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,150
it goes to the embedter, you're now in
the embedding dimension. I think

122
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
the embedding dimension. I think
 

123
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,150
the embedding dimension. I think
thousand 4,000 something like that as

124
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
thousand 4,000 something like that as
 

125
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,830
thousand 4,000 something like that as
was talked about last time. Then you

126
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
was talked about last time. Then you
 

127
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,830
was talked about last time. Then you
have many many layers of these

128
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
have many many layers of these
 

129
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,430
have many many layers of these
transformer

130
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
transformer
 

131
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,589
transformer
layer type things. Now these don't have

132
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
layer type things. Now these don't have
 

133
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,630
layer type things. Now these don't have
to be just attention and MLPS with

134
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
to be just attention and MLPS with
 

135
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,790
to be just attention and MLPS with
residual connections. They can also have

136
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800
residual connections. They can also have
 

137
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,229
residual connections. They can also have
states base models and mixtures of

138
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
states base models and mixtures of
 

139
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,750
states base models and mixtures of
experts. All things we've talked about

140
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
experts. All things we've talked about
 

141
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,190
experts. All things we've talked about
last time we showed you how these can be

142
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
last time we showed you how these can be
 

143
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,830
last time we showed you how these can be
constructed in some hybrid way.

144
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
constructed in some hybrid way.
 

145
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,190
constructed in some hybrid way.
The important thing is that everything

146
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
The important thing is that everything
 

147
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,750
The important thing is that everything
here the entire network is weight shared

148
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
here the entire network is weight shared
 

149
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,110
here the entire network is weight shared
across time right as was you know very

150
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
across time right as was you know very
 

151
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,350
across time right as was you know very
clear before but there's interactions

152
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
clear before but there's interactions
 

153
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,830
clear before but there's interactions
across time that happen through

154
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
across time that happen through
 

155
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,750
across time that happen through
attention as well as through par

156
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
attention as well as through par
 

157
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,869
attention as well as through par
carrying state across

158
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
carrying state across
 

159
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,630
carrying state across
so then things go up at the end you have

160
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
so then things go up at the end you have
 

161
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,750
so then things go up at the end you have
to dembed so this is like a linear layer

162
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
to dembed so this is like a linear layer
 

163
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,149
to dembed so this is like a linear layer
that will go back out to remember this

164
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
that will go back out to remember this
 

165
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,509
that will go back out to remember this
is like this 32,000 possible tokens.

166
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
is like this 32,000 possible tokens.
 

167
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,670
is like this 32,000 possible tokens.
This takes 32,000 long vectors and turns

168
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
This takes 32,000 long vectors and turns
 

169
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,910
This takes 32,000 long vectors and turns
them into 4,000 long vectors. Then this

170
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
them into 4,000 long vectors. Then this
 

171
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,070
them into 4,000 long vectors. Then this
has to go the opposite.

172
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,080
has to go the opposite.
 

173
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,750
has to go the opposite.
All these are learnable parameters. This

174
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
All these are learnable parameters. This
 

175
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,509
All these are learnable parameters. This
gives a set of scores associated with

176
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
gives a set of scores associated with
 

177
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,750
gives a set of scores associated with
every single token that might be an

178
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
every single token that might be an
 

179
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,630
every single token that might be an
output. You run that through a softmax

180
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
output. You run that through a softmax
 

181
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,470
output. You run that through a softmax
to get probabilities and you can feed

182
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
to get probabilities and you can feed
 

183
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,990
to get probabilities and you can feed
those probabilities into a cross entropy

184
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
those probabilities into a cross entropy
 

185
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,309
those probabilities into a cross entropy
loss for training. And the cross entropy

186
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
loss for training. And the cross entropy
 

187
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,830
loss for training. And the cross entropy
loss has to have something to compare

188
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
loss has to have something to compare
 

189
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,509
loss has to have something to compare
against. Okay, everyone remember this?

190
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
against. Okay, everyone remember this?
 

191
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,869
against. Okay, everyone remember this?
So in this particular case what we

192
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
So in this particular case what we
 

193
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,390
So in this particular case what we
mentioned last time you you train this

194
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
mentioned last time you you train this
 

195
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,190
mentioned last time you you train this
using next token prediction. So here you

196
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
using next token prediction. So here you
 

197
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,270
using next token prediction. So here you
know the it was like the famous poem

198
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
know the it was like the famous poem
 

199
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,030
know the it was like the famous poem
from Jabberwock Jabberwaraki from Louis

200
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
from Jabberwock Jabberwaraki from Louis
 

201
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,710
from Jabberwock Jabberwaraki from Louis
Carol to bleague was you know and then

202
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
Carol to bleague was you know and then
 

203
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,190
Carol to bleague was you know and then
and the sly toes did gyron gimble in the

204
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
and the sly toes did gyron gimble in the
 

205
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,390
and the sly toes did gyron gimble in the
wave you know all that stuff. So the

206
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
wave you know all that stuff. So the
 

207
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,390
wave you know all that stuff. So the
start would want to predict tw because

208
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
start would want to predict tw because
 

209
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,070
start would want to predict tw because
that's the first word of the poem and

210
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
that's the first word of the poem and
 

211
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,550
that's the first word of the poem and
the twaz wants to predict brillig and

212
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
the twaz wants to predict brillig and
 

213
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,310
the twaz wants to predict brillig and
and then brilleg wants to predict and

214
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
and then brilleg wants to predict and
 

215
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,789
and then brilleg wants to predict and
and so on.

216
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:20,799
and so on.
 

217
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,189
and so on.
At the very end there's a period that

218
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
At the very end there's a period that
 

219
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,510
At the very end there's a period that
ends the poem that ends the entire

220
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
ends the poem that ends the entire
 

221
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,469
ends the poem that ends the entire
document and then that should predict

222
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
document and then that should predict
 

223
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,990
document and then that should predict
stop.

224
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
stop.
 

225
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,230
stop.
We're done. Okay. So this is

226
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
We're done. Okay. So this is
 

227
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,870
We're done. Okay. So this is
pre-training. So everyone cool with

228
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
pre-training. So everyone cool with
 

229
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,590
pre-training. So everyone cool with
pre-training. Okay. So you pre-train

230
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
pre-training. Okay. So you pre-train
 

231
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,870
pre-training. Okay. So you pre-train
this on lots and lots of data. Now

232
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
this on lots and lots of data. Now
 

233
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,350
this on lots and lots of data. Now
things that people have learned

234
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
things that people have learned
 

235
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,590
things that people have learned
since the time they first started doing

236
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
since the time they first started doing
 

237
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,189
since the time they first started doing
this is that the quality and the nature

238
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
this is that the quality and the nature
 

239
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,870
this is that the quality and the nature
of the data that you pre-train on

240
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
of the data that you pre-train on
 

241
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,430
of the data that you pre-train on
matters. And so there's a lot of work in

242
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440
matters. And so there's a lot of work in
 

243
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,950
matters. And so there's a lot of work in
trying to figure out good pre-training

244
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
trying to figure out good pre-training
 

245
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,350
trying to figure out good pre-training
mixes that you know give rise to good

246
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
mixes that you know give rise to good
 

247
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,590
mixes that you know give rise to good
generalization in the model. So that's

248
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
generalization in the model. So that's
 

249
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,830
generalization in the model. So that's
all stuff that's happening. Yeah.

250
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
all stuff that's happening. Yeah.
 

251
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,590
all stuff that's happening. Yeah.
>> Call this process of training teacher

252
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
>> Call this process of training teacher
 

253
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,870
>> Call this process of training teacher
forcing as well. I know we called it

254
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
forcing as well. I know we called it
 

255
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,150
forcing as well. I know we called it
that during RN. I

256
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160

 

257
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,510

Great question. The question is, is this

258
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
Great question. The question is, is this
 

259
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,510
Great question. The question is, is this
teacher forcing? The answer is yes, this

260
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
teacher forcing? The answer is yes, this
 

261
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,029
teacher forcing? The answer is yes, this
is teacher forcing because it's

262
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
is teacher forcing because it's
 

263
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,270
is teacher forcing because it's
you you for the input you put in the

264
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
you you for the input you put in the
 

265
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,749
you you for the input you put in the
entire document that you want to do next

266
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
entire document that you want to do next
 

267
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,749
entire document that you want to do next
prediction on and for the output you

268
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
prediction on and for the output you
 

269
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,830
prediction on and for the output you
also do the entire document. You don't

270
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
also do the entire document. You don't
 

271
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,749
also do the entire document. You don't
care what it actually at any step

272
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
care what it actually at any step
 

273
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,629
care what it actually at any step
predicts here out of the softmaxes. You

274
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
predicts here out of the softmaxes. You
 

275
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,710
predicts here out of the softmaxes. You
just say whatever you were predicting I

276
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
just say whatever you were predicting I
 

277
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,230
just say whatever you were predicting I
want it to be brillig and then the next

278
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
want it to be brillig and then the next
 

279
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,390
want it to be brillig and then the next
thing I feed you is brillig in

280
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400

 

281
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,990

Okay, so this is the the way that uh

282
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay, so this is the the way that uh
 

283
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,870
Okay, so this is the the way that uh
pre-training happens. So comments just

284
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
pre-training happens. So comments just
 

285
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,950
pre-training happens. So comments just
little little bit of comments here is

286
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
little little bit of comments here is
 

287
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,270
little little bit of comments here is
that

288
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
that
 

289
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:56,230
that
the data mix matters

290
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240

 

291
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,950

and there's lots of work and empirical

292
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
and there's lots of work and empirical
 

293
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,629
and there's lots of work and empirical
work trying to figure out what is a good

294
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
work trying to figure out what is a good
 

295
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,749
work trying to figure out what is a good
data mix. Um so there was a very famous

296
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
data mix. Um so there was a very famous
 

297
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,830
data mix. Um so there was a very famous
paper that came out that was called uh

298
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
paper that came out that was called uh
 

299
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,670
paper that came out that was called uh
textbooks are all you need which was

300
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:07,680
textbooks are all you need which was
 

301
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,270
textbooks are all you need which was
arguing uh came out of Microsoft

302
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
arguing uh came out of Microsoft
 

303
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,230
arguing uh came out of Microsoft
research and it was the one of the

304
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
research and it was the one of the
 

305
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,909
research and it was the one of the
foundational

306
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
foundational
 

307
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,309
foundational
uh papers associated with the fi family

308
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
uh papers associated with the fi family
 

309
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,469
uh papers associated with the fi family
of models for example and that said that

310
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
of models for example and that said that
 

311
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,230
of models for example and that said that
showed pretty decisively that high

312
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
showed pretty decisively that high
 

313
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,390
showed pretty decisively that high
quality data

314
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
quality data
 

315
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,110
quality data
is helpful in training. And so one of

316
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
is helpful in training. And so one of
 

317
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,029
is helpful in training. And so one of
the things that you should be aware of

318
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
the things that you should be aware of
 

319
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,430
the things that you should be aware of
is when training these kinds of models

320
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
is when training these kinds of models
 

321
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,350
is when training these kinds of models
today

322
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
today
 

323
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,110
today
people will often mix in a lot of

324
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
people will often mix in a lot of
 

325
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,830
people will often mix in a lot of
synthetic data. So by synthetic data

326
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
synthetic data. So by synthetic data
 

327
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,749
synthetic data. So by synthetic data
this is data that we ourselves generate

328
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
this is data that we ourselves generate
 

329
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,390
this is data that we ourselves generate
from from another model uh that has the

330
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
from from another model uh that has the
 

331
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,830
from from another model uh that has the
right kind of qualities from the mix

332
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
right kind of qualities from the mix
 

333
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,629
right kind of qualities from the mix
point of view. Okay. So that's that

334
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
point of view. Okay. So that's that
 

335
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,550
point of view. Okay. So that's that
really that idea really came into full

336
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
really that idea really came into full
 

337
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,390
really that idea really came into full
force in the textbooks are all unique

338
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
force in the textbooks are all unique
 

339
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,710
force in the textbooks are all unique
paper.

340
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
paper.
 

341
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,670
paper.
So okay so data mix matters you do this

342
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
So okay so data mix matters you do this
 

343
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,189
So okay so data mix matters you do this
okay now

344
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199

 

345
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,870

that's the story for what you do at the

346
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
that's the story for what you do at the
 

347
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,469
that's the story for what you do at the
training time for pre-training time then

348
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
training time for pre-training time then
 

349
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,830
training time for pre-training time then
what do you do when you want to do

350
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
what do you do when you want to do
 

351
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,990
what do you do when you want to do
inference time recap this very briefly

352
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
inference time recap this very briefly
 

353
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,309
inference time recap this very briefly
so here it's important to understand

354
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
so here it's important to understand
 

355
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,469
so here it's important to understand
that the way these models are are

356
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
that the way these models are are
 

357
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,070
that the way these models are are
typically used is in what we consider an

358
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
typically used is in what we consider an
 

359
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,790
typically used is in what we consider an
autocomplete style auto reggressive

360
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
autocomplete style auto reggressive
 

361
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,790
autocomplete style auto reggressive
generation Okay, so this again was

362
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
generation Okay, so this again was
 

363
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,670
generation Okay, so this again was
mentioned before. I just want to

364
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
mentioned before. I just want to
 

365
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,029
mentioned before. I just want to
emphasize I want to bring out the idea

366
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
emphasize I want to bring out the idea
 

367
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,230
emphasize I want to bring out the idea
of what a prompt is in this picture.

368
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
of what a prompt is in this picture.
 

369
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,589
of what a prompt is in this picture.
So the way it works is you start with a

370
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
So the way it works is you start with a
 

371
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,150
So the way it works is you start with a
prompt. This is the thing that you want

372
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
prompt. This is the thing that you want
 

373
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,189
prompt. This is the thing that you want
the model to autocomplete.

374
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:39,199
the model to autocomplete.
 

375
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,029
the model to autocomplete.
So you start with start. Sorry, I don't

376
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
So you start with start. Sorry, I don't
 

377
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,309
So you start with start. Sorry, I don't
want to write anything right now. Just

378
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
want to write anything right now. Just
 

379
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,070
want to write anything right now. Just
use this. You start with start and then

380
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
use this. You start with start and then
 

381
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,629
use this. You start with start and then
you have your prompt tokens.

382
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
you have your prompt tokens.
 

383
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,870
you have your prompt tokens.
And so you feed this into the model.

384
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:50,880
And so you feed this into the model.
 

385
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,230
And so you feed this into the model.
This is part of the context of the

386
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
This is part of the context of the
 

387
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,909
This is part of the context of the
model. and the model runs. But notice

388
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
model. and the model runs. But notice
 

389
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,430
model. and the model runs. But notice
here

390
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
here
 

391
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,390
here
that on the prompt, for most of the

392
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
that on the prompt, for most of the
 

393
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,869
that on the prompt, for most of the
prompt, you don't even have to run the

394
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
prompt, you don't even have to run the
 

395
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,830
prompt, you don't even have to run the
dmb.

396
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
dmb.
 

397
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,909
dmb.
You're not asking for anything at this

398
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
You're not asking for anything at this
 

399
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,150
You're not asking for anything at this
point. And everything after the block,

400
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
point. And everything after the block,
 

401
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,830
point. And everything after the block,
the dmbs

402
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
the dmbs
 

403
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,790
the dmbs
across time. So you could run it, not

404
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
across time. So you could run it, not
 

405
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,230
across time. So you could run it, not
run it. It doesn't matter. You never use

406
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
run it. It doesn't matter. You never use
 

407
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,629
run it. It doesn't matter. You never use
it. You don't do any sampling.

408
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
it. You don't do any sampling.
 

409
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,550
it. You don't do any sampling.
However,

410
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
However,
 

411
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,430
However,
the last token in the prompt, whatever

412
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
the last token in the prompt, whatever
 

413
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,270
the last token in the prompt, whatever
the last thing is, that's the thing that

414
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
the last thing is, that's the thing that
 

415
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,990
the last thing is, that's the thing that
you want to start completing.

416
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
you want to start completing.
 

417
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,550
you want to start completing.
So, you want the generation for that.

418
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
So, you want the generation for that.
 

419
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,550
So, you want the generation for that.
So, that goes all the way up through the

420
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
So, that goes all the way up through the
 

421
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,909
So, that goes all the way up through the
dmbes into the softmax.

422
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
dmbes into the softmax.
 

423
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,829
dmbes into the softmax.
And a comment here, just wanted to make

424
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
And a comment here, just wanted to make
 

425
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,949
And a comment here, just wanted to make
it um explicit based on some questions,

426
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
it um explicit based on some questions,
 

427
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,430
it um explicit based on some questions,
is that the softmax can take a

428
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
is that the softmax can take a
 

429
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,829
is that the softmax can take a
temperature parameter in. And what the

430
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
temperature parameter in. And what the
 

431
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,910
temperature parameter in. And what the
temperature parameter does is it says

432
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
temperature parameter does is it says
 

433
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,710
temperature parameter does is it says
remember softmax takes x and then it

434
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
remember softmax takes x and then it
 

435
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,949
remember softmax takes x and then it
weighs it and it normalizes it by all

436
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
weighs it and it normalizes it by all
 

437
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,030
weighs it and it normalizes it by all
the other xs.

438
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
the other xs.
 

439
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,110
the other xs.
However, you can choose to take x of

440
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
However, you can choose to take x of
 

441
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,389
However, you can choose to take x of
five times something or x of 0.1 times

442
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
five times something or x of 0.1 times
 

443
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,150
five times something or x of 0.1 times
something. And by changing that

444
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
something. And by changing that
 

445
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,150
something. And by changing that
parameter, the thing you multiply by,

446
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
parameter, the thing you multiply by,
 

447
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,990
parameter, the thing you multiply by,
you can move it to either if you set it

448
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
you can move it to either if you set it
 

449
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,710
you can move it to either if you set it
very close to zero, it'll basically go

450
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
very close to zero, it'll basically go
 

451
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,710
very close to zero, it'll basically go
to uniform distribution. And if you set

452
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
to uniform distribution. And if you set
 

453
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,350
to uniform distribution. And if you set
that thing you're multiplying by to a

454
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
that thing you're multiplying by to a
 

455
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,949
that thing you're multiplying by to a
very big number, you're pretty much

456
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
very big number, you're pretty much
 

457
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,190
very big number, you're pretty much
going to go to whatever the highest

458
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
going to go to whatever the highest
 

459
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,110
going to go to whatever the highest
probability is, right? To maximum

460
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
probability is, right? To maximum
 

461
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,070
probability is, right? To maximum
likelihood kind of decoding.

462
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
likelihood kind of decoding.
 

463
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,750
likelihood kind of decoding.
So you have an adjustment there that can

464
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
So you have an adjustment there that can
 

465
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,990
So you have an adjustment there that can
be done. So you have a temp goes to a

466
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
be done. So you have a temp goes to a
 

467
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,230
be done. So you have a temp goes to a
softmax. The output of the soft max is

468
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
softmax. The output of the soft max is
 

469
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,670
softmax. The output of the soft max is
probabilities. So these are

470
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
probabilities. So these are
 

471
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:37,509
probabilities. So these are
probabilities

472
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519

 

473
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,030

and those goes go into the sampler.

474
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
and those goes go into the sampler.
 

475
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,150
and those goes go into the sampler.
Again, it was talked about last time. I

476
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
Again, it was talked about last time. I
 

477
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,190
Again, it was talked about last time. I
just want to make sure everyone's on the

478
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
just want to make sure everyone's on the
 

479
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,750
just want to make sure everyone's on the
same page. And the sampler then gives

480
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
same page. And the sampler then gives
 

481
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,550
same page. And the sampler then gives
you a token. You then take that token

482
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
you a token. You then take that token
 

483
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,110
you a token. You then take that token
and you feed it in here. So, the

484
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
and you feed it in here. So, the
 

485
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,949
and you feed it in here. So, the
important thing that I want to make

486
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
important thing that I want to make
 

487
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,030
important thing that I want to make
clear is that the prompt doesn't have

488
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
clear is that the prompt doesn't have
 

489
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,150
clear is that the prompt doesn't have
any of this coming back

490
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
any of this coming back
 

491
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,750
any of this coming back
here. Once you're doing generation, you

492
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
here. Once you're doing generation, you
 

493
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,790
here. Once you're doing generation, you
have this sequentiality.

494
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
have this sequentiality.
 

495
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,870
have this sequentiality.
Okay? So, you keep running it and you

496
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:02,880
Okay? So, you keep running it and you
 

497
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,030
Okay? So, you keep running it and you
stop whenever this thing generates a

498
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
stop whenever this thing generates a
 

499
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,949
stop whenever this thing generates a
stop token.

500
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
stop token.
 

501
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,230
stop token.
So the instant it generates a stop

502
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
So the instant it generates a stop
 

503
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,190
So the instant it generates a stop
token, you're like, I'm done.

504
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
token, you're like, I'm done.
 

505
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,870
token, you're like, I'm done.
>> Yes.

506
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880

 

507
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,750

>> Basically,

508
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
>> Basically,
 

509
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,230
>> Basically,
>> great question. Um, I only drew these

510
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
>> great question. Um, I only drew these
 

511
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,110
>> great question. Um, I only drew these
blocks. And so all you really need to be

512
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
blocks. And so all you really need to be
 

513
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,190
blocks. And so all you really need to be
able to do the thing you want over here

514
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
able to do the thing you want over here
 

515
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,069
able to do the thing you want over here
is you need all of the state from a

516
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
is you need all of the state from a
 

517
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,829
is you need all of the state from a
state space model and all of the key

518
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
state space model and all of the key
 

519
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,389
state space model and all of the key
values for attention.

520
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
values for attention.
 

521
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,470
values for attention.
So you're right in technically we could

522
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
So you're right in technically we could
 

523
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,389
So you're right in technically we could
have decapitated this like a little bit

524
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
have decapitated this like a little bit
 

525
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,190
have decapitated this like a little bit
below and not done that final or the

526
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
below and not done that final or the
 

527
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,190
below and not done that final or the
final things there. Basically as soon as

528
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
final things there. Basically as soon as
 

529
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,590
final things there. Basically as soon as
whatever was carrying state with it key

530
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
whatever was carrying state with it key
 

531
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,550
whatever was carrying state with it key
values or anything we could have

532
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
values or anything we could have
 

533
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,870
values or anything we could have
stopped. Okay. Does that answer your

534
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
stopped. Okay. Does that answer your
 

535
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,350
stopped. Okay. Does that answer your
question? Okay. So everyone good with

536
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
question? Okay. So everyone good with
 

537
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:05,590
question? Okay. So everyone good with
this? Yeah.

538
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600

 

539
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,590

Yeah, great question. So, let me maybe I

540
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
Yeah, great question. So, let me maybe I
 

541
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,150
Yeah, great question. So, let me maybe I
can write this out.

542
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160

 

543
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,470

Standard softmax is e to the

544
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480

 

545
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,110

x i divided by sum

546
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
x i divided by sum
 

547
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,590
x i divided by sum
e to the xj

548
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
e to the xj
 

549
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,430
e to the xj
sum over j. Right? That's a standard

550
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
sum over j. Right? That's a standard
 

551
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,949
sum over j. Right? That's a standard
softmax.

552
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
softmax.
 

553
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,230
softmax.
So what we're going to do is we're just

554
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
So what we're going to do is we're just
 

555
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,990
So what we're going to do is we're just
going to add a parameter

556
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000

 

557
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,350

one over t

558
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
one over t
 

559
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,750
one over t
in front.

560
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
in front.
 

561
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,630
in front.
So when t is zero, this is a very big

562
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
So when t is zero, this is a very big
 

563
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,230
So when t is zero, this is a very big
number

564
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
number
 

565
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,069
number
and that will basically make it pick out

566
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
and that will basically make it pick out
 

567
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,030
and that will basically make it pick out
a max. the soft max will become a max

568
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
a max. the soft max will become a max
 

569
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,949
a max. the soft max will become a max
and meaning that it'll give all the

570
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
and meaning that it'll give all the
 

571
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,110
and meaning that it'll give all the
probability to the maximum entry and

572
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
probability to the maximum entry and
 

573
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,430
probability to the maximum entry and
zero probability to everybody else. But

574
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
zero probability to everybody else. But
 

575
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,750
zero probability to everybody else. But
if you make the temperature parameter

576
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
if you make the temperature parameter
 

577
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,430
if you make the temperature parameter
higher, it's going to make the

578
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
higher, it's going to make the
 

579
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,790
higher, it's going to make the
probabilities more uniform. That's what

580
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
probabilities more uniform. That's what
 

581
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,990
probabilities more uniform. That's what
it mean. So it's a hyperparameter,

582
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
it mean. So it's a hyperparameter,
 

583
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,269
it mean. So it's a hyperparameter,
but you don't you shouldn't really think

584
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
but you don't you shouldn't really think
 

585
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,509
but you don't you shouldn't really think
of it as a hyperparameter necessarily

586
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
of it as a hyperparameter necessarily
 

587
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,870
of it as a hyperparameter necessarily
because it's not something that we're

588
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
because it's not something that we're
 

589
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,550
because it's not something that we're
adjusting during training. We're just

590
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
adjusting during training. We're just
 

591
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,509
adjusting during training. We're just
using it. It's something we tune at use

592
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
using it. It's something we tune at use
 

593
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,990
using it. It's something we tune at use
for our purposes.

594
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
for our purposes.
 

595
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,230
for our purposes.
So it's not like anywhere.

596
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240

 

597
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,030

>> It's a knob that we turn. So if if you

598
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
>> It's a knob that we turn. So if if you
 

599
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,990
>> It's a knob that we turn. So if if you
ever use any of the um open source local

600
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
ever use any of the um open source local
 

601
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,470
ever use any of the um open source local
running things of you know like Olama or

602
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
running things of you know like Olama or
 

603
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,069
running things of you know like Olama or
something, you'll see you can adjust the

604
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
something, you'll see you can adjust the
 

605
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,910
something, you'll see you can adjust the
temperature and it'll adjust the

606
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
temperature and it'll adjust the
 

607
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,949
temperature and it'll adjust the
generations. You should play with it. If

608
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
generations. You should play with it. If
 

609
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:41,990
generations. You should play with it. If
you haven't played with it yourself, you

610
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
you haven't played with it yourself, you
 

611
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,110
you haven't played with it yourself, you
should play with it to see what happens.

612
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
should play with it to see what happens.
 

613
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,550
should play with it to see what happens.
Okay, just making sure everyone's on the

614
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
Okay, just making sure everyone's on the
 

615
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,069
Okay, just making sure everyone's on the
same page. It's all my only objective

616
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
same page. It's all my only objective
 

617
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,590
same page. It's all my only objective
right now. Everyone good? Okay, so now

618
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
right now. Everyone good? Okay, so now
 

619
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,949
right now. Everyone good? Okay, so now
we know what a prompt what I mean when I

620
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
we know what a prompt what I mean when I
 

621
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,269
we know what a prompt what I mean when I
say prompt. So let's like take a little

622
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,279
say prompt. So let's like take a little
 

623
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,790
say prompt. So let's like take a little
bit of history, a tour through history

624
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
bit of history, a tour through history
 

625
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,269
bit of history, a tour through history
here. Um, and kind of how we what

626
00:12:59,269 --> 00:12:59,279
here. Um, and kind of how we what
 

627
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,949
here. Um, and kind of how we what
happened.

628
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
happened.
 

629
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,509
happened.
So the transformers key paper, attention

630
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519
So the transformers key paper, attention
 

631
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,389
So the transformers key paper, attention
is all you need that came out in 2017.

632
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
is all you need that came out in 2017.
 

633
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,949
is all you need that came out in 2017.
in

634
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
in
 

635
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,629
in
right soon after you had the BERT paper

636
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
right soon after you had the BERT paper
 

637
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,710
right soon after you had the BERT paper
and BERT was revolutionary in terms of

638
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
and BERT was revolutionary in terms of
 

639
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,949
and BERT was revolutionary in terms of
its impact because suddenly it became

640
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
its impact because suddenly it became
 

641
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,350
its impact because suddenly it became
the case that these better embeddings

642
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
the case that these better embeddings
 

643
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,870
the case that these better embeddings
you had these nice features you got out

644
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
you had these nice features you got out
 

645
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,829
you had these nice features you got out
of BERT no matter what natural language

646
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
of BERT no matter what natural language
 

647
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,829
of BERT no matter what natural language
problem you were doing you could write a

648
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
problem you were doing you could write a
 

649
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,310
problem you were doing you could write a
paper that was basically I take the

650
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,320
paper that was basically I take the
 

651
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,030
paper that was basically I take the
exact approach as we were doing before w

652
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
exact approach as we were doing before w
 

653
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,269
exact approach as we were doing before w
with some featurization and I'm just

654
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
with some featurization and I'm just
 

655
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,190
with some featurization and I'm just
going to use BERT featur ization and

656
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
going to use BERT featur ization and
 

657
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,990
going to use BERT featur ization and
performance gets better and in many

658
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
performance gets better and in many
 

659
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,310
performance gets better and in many
cases better in a way that's shifted

660
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
cases better in a way that's shifted
 

661
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,110
cases better in a way that's shifted
from this isn't really usable to this is

662
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
from this isn't really usable to this is
 

663
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,269
from this isn't really usable to this is
now usable.

664
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
now usable.
 

665
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,710
now usable.
So at that time GPT1 came out in 2018

666
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
So at that time GPT1 came out in 2018
 

667
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,150
So at that time GPT1 came out in 2018
and what GPT1 said was it set up this

668
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
and what GPT1 said was it set up this
 

669
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,230
and what GPT1 said was it set up this
architecture decoder only and it said if

670
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
architecture decoder only and it said if
 

671
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,629
architecture decoder only and it said if
you just pre-train this way just do next

672
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
you just pre-train this way just do next
 

673
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,790
you just pre-train this way just do next
token prediction instead of BERT style

674
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
token prediction instead of BERT style
 

675
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,310
token prediction instead of BERT style
pre-training

676
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
pre-training
 

677
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,629
pre-training
then you get something that has good

678
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
then you get something that has good
 

679
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,870
then you get something that has good
embeddings these embeddings are also

680
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
embeddings these embeddings are also
 

681
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,430
embeddings these embeddings are also
good they're like BERT quite quality

682
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
good they're like BERT quite quality
 

683
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,829
good they're like BERT quite quality
good embeddings

684
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
good embeddings
 

685
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,509
good embeddings
that was GPT1

686
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
that was GPT1
 

687
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,990
that was GPT1
So GPT1 was taking the perspective this

688
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000
So GPT1 was taking the perspective this
 

689
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,590
So GPT1 was taking the perspective this
is pre-training. We can use this to get

690
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
is pre-training. We can use this to get
 

691
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,350
is pre-training. We can use this to get
something that we could then fine-tune

692
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
something that we could then fine-tune
 

693
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,430
something that we could then fine-tune
for another task or just to use its

694
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
for another task or just to use its
 

695
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,110
for another task or just to use its
embeddings.

696
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
embeddings.
 

697
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,509
embeddings.
Okay.

698
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
Okay.
 

699
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,269
Okay.
GPT1 was released open source.

700
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
GPT1 was released open source.
 

701
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,550
GPT1 was released open source.
Then came GPT2

702
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:38,560
Then came GPT2
 

703
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,750
Then came GPT2
and GPT2 in 2019

704
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
and GPT2 in 2019
 

705
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,629
and GPT2 in 2019
was basically made everything bigger.

706
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:44,639
was basically made everything bigger.
 

707
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,829
was basically made everything bigger.
the embedding got bigger, the number of

708
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
the embedding got bigger, the number of
 

709
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,389
the embedding got bigger, the number of
layers got bigger, the all the parameter

710
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
layers got bigger, the all the parameter
 

711
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,470
layers got bigger, the all the parameter
counts increased

712
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
counts increased
 

713
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,230
counts increased
and it said that suddenly in GPT2

714
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
and it said that suddenly in GPT2
 

715
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,870
and it said that suddenly in GPT2
that many new behaviors seem to emerge.

716
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
that many new behaviors seem to emerge.
 

717
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,389
that many new behaviors seem to emerge.
One was you could actually do this

718
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
One was you could actually do this
 

719
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,670
One was you could actually do this
autogressive completions and when you

720
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
autogressive completions and when you
 

721
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,990
autogressive completions and when you
did it you it resulted in things that

722
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000
did it you it resulted in things that
 

723
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,030
did it you it resulted in things that
were at the time shockingly natural pros

724
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
were at the time shockingly natural pros
 

725
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,550
were at the time shockingly natural pros
or poetry. It could track genre. So you

726
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
or poetry. It could track genre. So you
 

727
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,350
or poetry. It could track genre. So you
could start writing a poem and then say

728
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
could start writing a poem and then say
 

729
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,910
could start writing a poem and then say
complete and it would continue writing a

730
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
complete and it would continue writing a
 

731
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,069
complete and it would continue writing a
poem.

732
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
poem.
 

733
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,710
poem.
And if you started writing a story and

734
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
And if you started writing a story and
 

735
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,069
And if you started writing a story and
there's a very famous example about a

736
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:26,079
there's a very famous example about a
 

737
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,710
there's a very famous example about a
story about unicorns, right? It will

738
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
story about unicorns, right? It will
 

739
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,470
story about unicorns, right? It will
continue writing a story about unicorns.

740
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
continue writing a story about unicorns.
 

741
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,069
continue writing a story about unicorns.
And

742
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:34,079
And
 

743
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,230
And
that was one thing that it had at that

744
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
that was one thing that it had at that
 

745
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,509
that was one thing that it had at that
point. So the autocomplete aspect really

746
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
point. So the autocomplete aspect really
 

747
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,949
point. So the autocomplete aspect really
began to shine at GPT2.

748
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:42,959
began to shine at GPT2.
 

749
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,470
began to shine at GPT2.
The second thing was that

750
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,480
The second thing was that
 

751
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,829
The second thing was that
the paper showed that this model clearly

752
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
the paper showed that this model clearly
 

753
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,629
the paper showed that this model clearly
knows facts about the world. So the

754
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
knows facts about the world. So the
 

755
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,150
knows facts about the world. So the
example was like this.

756
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
example was like this.
 

757
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,189
example was like this.
You add have the prompt be the capital

758
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
You add have the prompt be the capital
 

759
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,829
You add have the prompt be the capital
of France is.

760
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
of France is.
 

761
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,509
of France is.
Okay, that's the prompt. Capital of

762
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
Okay, that's the prompt. Capital of
 

763
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,310
Okay, that's the prompt. Capital of
France is and you say autocomplete

764
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
France is and you say autocomplete
 

765
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,829
France is and you say autocomplete
and it autocompletes with Paris.

766
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
and it autocompletes with Paris.
 

767
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,590
and it autocompletes with Paris.
So that showed that the model knew these

768
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
So that showed that the model knew these
 

769
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,710
So that showed that the model knew these
facts, many many facts.

770
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:14,720
facts, many many facts.
 

771
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,990
facts, many many facts.
So this idea that the model has

772
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
So this idea that the model has
 

773
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,350
So this idea that the model has
knowledge about the facts that can be

774
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
knowledge about the facts that can be
 

775
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,670
knowledge about the facts that can be
elicited with the right kind of prompt.

776
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
elicited with the right kind of prompt.
 

777
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,269
elicited with the right kind of prompt.
This is sometimes called zeroot

778
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
This is sometimes called zeroot
 

779
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,269
This is sometimes called zeroot
learning. Like you don't have to train

780
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
learning. Like you don't have to train
 

781
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,949
learning. Like you don't have to train
it to do this task at all. You take the

782
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
it to do this task at all. You take the
 

783
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,590
it to do this task at all. You take the
model off the shelf and you ask it a

784
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
model off the shelf and you ask it a
 

785
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,110
model off the shelf and you ask it a
question and it does the answer for you.

786
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
question and it does the answer for you.
 

787
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,350
question and it does the answer for you.
Everyone with me?

788
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,360
Everyone with me?
 

789
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,710
Everyone with me?
Okay. So very brief aside, GPT2 when it

790
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
Okay. So very brief aside, GPT2 when it
 

791
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,550
Okay. So very brief aside, GPT2 when it
came out,

792
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
came out,
 

793
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,189
came out,
it was not immediately open sourced. In

794
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
it was not immediately open sourced. In
 

795
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,189
it was not immediately open sourced. In
fact, when this behavior of being able

796
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
fact, when this behavior of being able
 

797
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,870
fact, when this behavior of being able
to generate natural looking text came

798
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:46,880
to generate natural looking text came
 

799
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,150
to generate natural looking text came
out, the people uh within OpenAI that

800
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
out, the people uh within OpenAI that
 

801
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,749
out, the people uh within OpenAI that
were concerned with uh AI safety said we

802
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
were concerned with uh AI safety said we
 

803
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,990
were concerned with uh AI safety said we
should not release this because suddenly

804
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
should not release this because suddenly
 

805
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,269
should not release this because suddenly
you'll get a whole bunch of AI generated

806
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
you'll get a whole bunch of AI generated
 

807
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,389
you'll get a whole bunch of AI generated
text that could be used for

808
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
text that could be used for
 

809
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,150
text that could be used for
disinformation or all kinds of other bad

810
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
disinformation or all kinds of other bad
 

811
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,029
disinformation or all kinds of other bad
things. Other people claimed that the

812
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
things. Other people claimed that the
 

813
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,110
things. Other people claimed that the
concerns were these concerns were a good

814
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
concerns were these concerns were a good
 

815
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,829
concerns were these concerns were a good
way of getting press and so calling

816
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
way of getting press and so calling
 

817
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,189
way of getting press and so calling
causing controversy causing it to be

818
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
causing controversy causing it to be
 

819
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,669
causing controversy causing it to be
more popularized. Whatever it was, there

820
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
more popularized. Whatever it was, there
 

821
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,029
more popularized. Whatever it was, there
was some degree of controversy

822
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
was some degree of controversy
 

823
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,949
was some degree of controversy
associated with GPT2, but eventually it

824
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
associated with GPT2, but eventually it
 

825
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,750
associated with GPT2, but eventually it
was released openly.

826
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
was released openly.
 

827
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,630
was released openly.
Okay, so that was GP29.

828
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
Okay, so that was GP29.
 

829
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,909
Okay, so that was GP29.
Then you had GP3. So GP3 was talked

830
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919
Then you had GP3. So GP3 was talked
 

831
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,829
Then you had GP3. So GP3 was talked
about the architecture of GP3 was shown

832
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
about the architecture of GP3 was shown
 

833
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,669
about the architecture of GP3 was shown
minor variations of architecture largely

834
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
minor variations of architecture largely
 

835
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,750
minor variations of architecture largely
it was just bigger um and

836
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
it was just bigger um and
 

837
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,549
it was just bigger um and
the paper was entitled large language

838
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
the paper was entitled large language
 

839
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,150
the paper was entitled large language
models are few shot learners or

840
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
models are few shot learners or
 

841
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,990
models are few shot learners or
something of that effect and it said

842
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
something of that effect and it said
 

843
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,110
something of that effect and it said
that hey by making the model bigger it

844
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
that hey by making the model bigger it
 

845
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,350
that hey by making the model bigger it
isn't just that it knows facts about the

846
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
isn't just that it knows facts about the
 

847
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,549
isn't just that it knows facts about the
world but we can teach it something in

848
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
world but we can teach it something in
 

849
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,310
world but we can teach it something in
the prompt and have it continue the

850
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
the prompt and have it continue the
 

851
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,830
the prompt and have it continue the
behavior.

852
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
behavior.
 

853
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,430
behavior.
So this is different than the

854
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
So this is different than the
 

855
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,870
So this is different than the
completions you already had here which

856
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
completions you already had here which
 

857
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,190
completions you already had here which
were kind of like genre style. These are

858
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
were kind of like genre style. These are
 

859
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,830
were kind of like genre style. These are
more artificial.

860
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
more artificial.
 

861
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,750
more artificial.
So this idea of incontext learning was

862
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
So this idea of incontext learning was
 

863
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,789
So this idea of incontext learning was
brought out. So just to give you a clean

864
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
brought out. So just to give you a clean
 

865
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,789
brought out. So just to give you a clean
example I a very classic example that

866
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
example I a very classic example that
 

867
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,549
example I a very classic example that
people use for this is for GPD3 you

868
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:14,559
people use for this is for GPD3 you
 

869
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,470
people use for this is for GPD3 you
could do things like this. You could

870
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
could do things like this. You could
 

871
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,190
could do things like this. You could
have the prompt be red colon Ruby

872
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
have the prompt be red colon Ruby
 

873
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,270
have the prompt be red colon Ruby
semicolon blue colon

874
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
semicolon blue colon
 

875
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,909
semicolon blue colon
and tell autocomplete.

876
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
and tell autocomplete.
 

877
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,470
and tell autocomplete.
So this isn't at the time people thought

878
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
So this isn't at the time people thought
 

879
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,710
So this isn't at the time people thought
this isn't very natural like text.

880
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
this isn't very natural like text.
 

881
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,669
this isn't very natural like text.
um but it completes with Sapphire.

882
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
um but it completes with Sapphire.
 

883
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,669
um but it completes with Sapphire.
Whereas if you do red colon raspberry

884
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
Whereas if you do red colon raspberry
 

885
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,230
Whereas if you do red colon raspberry
blue colon it'll complete with

886
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:44,240
blue colon it'll complete with
 

887
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,310
blue colon it'll complete with
blueberry. So does everyone see what's

888
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
blueberry. So does everyone see what's
 

889
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,549
blueberry. So does everyone see what's
happening here? So you're telling it

890
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
happening here? So you're telling it
 

891
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,150
happening here? So you're telling it
you're giving it some examples. We're

892
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
you're giving it some examples. We're
 

893
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,710
you're giving it some examples. We're
doing a problem for this problem which I

894
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
doing a problem for this problem which I
 

895
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,909
doing a problem for this problem which I
haven't told you what it is. I've not

896
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:53,919
haven't told you what it is. I've not
 

897
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,070
haven't told you what it is. I've not
described the problem at all. The answer

898
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
described the problem at all. The answer
 

899
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,549
described the problem at all. The answer
to red is Ruby. What's the answer to

900
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
to red is Ruby. What's the answer to
 

901
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,710
to red is Ruby. What's the answer to
blue?

902
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
blue?
 

903
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,070
blue?
Here's a problem. The answer to red is

904
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
Here's a problem. The answer to red is
 

905
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,470
Here's a problem. The answer to red is
raspberry. What's the answer to blue?

906
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
raspberry. What's the answer to blue?
 

907
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,549
raspberry. What's the answer to blue?
And what it's able to do is just by

908
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
And what it's able to do is just by
 

909
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,549
And what it's able to do is just by
looking at the context learn that what's

910
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
looking at the context learn that what's
 

911
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,230
looking at the context learn that what's
being happening here is we're talking

912
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,240
being happening here is we're talking
 

913
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,710
being happening here is we're talking
about gemstones

914
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
about gemstones
 

915
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,750
about gemstones
and it has in its uh weights the

916
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
and it has in its uh weights the
 

917
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,230
and it has in its uh weights the
knowledge that the blue gemstone is

918
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
knowledge that the blue gemstone is
 

919
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,710
knowledge that the blue gemstone is
sapphire. So the way you would elicit

920
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
sapphire. So the way you would elicit
 

921
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,630
sapphire. So the way you would elicit
this information in this zero shot style

922
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
this information in this zero shot style
 

923
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,950
this information in this zero shot style
would be a prompt that said the blue

924
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:26,960
would be a prompt that said the blue
 

925
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,430
would be a prompt that said the blue
gemstone is

926
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
gemstone is
 

927
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,510
gemstone is
or the famous blue gemstone is and

928
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
or the famous blue gemstone is and
 

929
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,350
or the famous blue gemstone is and
sapphire would come out and the most

930
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
sapphire would come out and the most
 

931
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,029
sapphire would come out and the most
popular blueberry is blueberry.

932
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
popular blueberry is blueberry.
 

933
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,590
popular blueberry is blueberry.
Okay, you have to you have to you have

934
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
Okay, you have to you have to you have
 

935
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,150
Okay, you have to you have to you have
to prompt it a particular way. This is a

936
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
to prompt it a particular way. This is a
 

937
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,470
to prompt it a particular way. This is a
different way of prompting by examples.

938
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
different way of prompting by examples.
 

939
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,510
different way of prompting by examples.
Okay, everyone with me? So this ability

940
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,520
Okay, everyone with me? So this ability
 

941
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,510
Okay, everyone with me? So this ability
is called in context learning. So one of

942
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:53,520
is called in context learning. So one of
 

943
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,430
is called in context learning. So one of
the projects we said was, you know, this

944
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
the projects we said was, you know, this
 

945
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,390
the projects we said was, you know, this
is a very important um ability of large

946
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
is a very important um ability of large
 

947
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,789
is a very important um ability of large
language models. It's considered the

948
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
language models. It's considered the
 

949
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,430
language models. It's considered the
root ability actually from which all of

950
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
root ability actually from which all of
 

951
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,750
root ability actually from which all of
the other nice abilities that you really

952
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
the other nice abilities that you really
 

953
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,310
the other nice abilities that you really
care about grow from. So people care a

954
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320
care about grow from. So people care a
 

955
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,150
care about grow from. So people care a
lot about it. And GP3 was the one that

956
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:10,160
lot about it. And GP3 was the one that
 

957
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,390
lot about it. And GP3 was the one that
kind of showed that this was happening

958
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
kind of showed that this was happening
 

959
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,870
kind of showed that this was happening
cleanly. This sometimes called fshot

960
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
cleanly. This sometimes called fshot
 

961
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,470
cleanly. This sometimes called fshot
learning because you gave it a few

962
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:16,480
learning because you gave it a few
 

963
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,070
learning because you gave it a few
examples.

964
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,080
examples.
 

965
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,950
examples.
Okay. So, pause here for a minute. Any

966
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
Okay. So, pause here for a minute. Any
 

967
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,549
Okay. So, pause here for a minute. Any
questions

968
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:22,559
questions
 

969
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,150
questions
on what is meant by in context learning?

970
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,160
on what is meant by in context learning?
 

971
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,789
on what is meant by in context learning?
Okay. Great. So, now

972
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
Okay. Great. So, now
 

973
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,909
Okay. Great. So, now
I want to talk about like why was this

974
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
I want to talk about like why was this
 

975
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,590
I want to talk about like why was this
considered revolutionary at the time?

976
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
considered revolutionary at the time?
 

977
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,270
considered revolutionary at the time?
And the reason was that

978
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
And the reason was that
 

979
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,549
And the reason was that
before the idea of ICL of incontext

980
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
before the idea of ICL of incontext
 

981
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,510
before the idea of ICL of incontext
learning, the way that everybody solved

982
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
learning, the way that everybody solved
 

983
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,070
learning, the way that everybody solved
a machine learning problem was that you

984
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080
a machine learning problem was that you
 

985
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,390
a machine learning problem was that you
collected a data set.

986
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:54,400
collected a data set.
 

987
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,270
collected a data set.
You then said, "Okay, I want to train a

988
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
You then said, "Okay, I want to train a
 

989
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,669
You then said, "Okay, I want to train a
model on this data set to do

990
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
model on this data set to do
 

991
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,909
model on this data set to do
predictions. I'll hold out some data,

992
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:01,919
predictions. I'll hold out some data,
 

993
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,950
predictions. I'll hold out some data,
all that stuff." And you train a model.

994
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:04,960
all that stuff." And you train a model.
 

995
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,310
all that stuff." And you train a model.
You say okay what features do I use for

996
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,320
You say okay what features do I use for
 

997
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,149
You say okay what features do I use for
the features? You might say I will use

998
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
the features? You might say I will use
 

999
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,470
the features? You might say I will use
the following pre-trained model or

1000
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:12,480
the following pre-trained model or
 

1001
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,789
the following pre-trained model or
embedding to get features. That's how

1002
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,799
embedding to get features. That's how
 

1003
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,230
embedding to get features. That's how
people used to do things.

1004
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
people used to do things.
 

1005
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,390
people used to do things.
Now

1006
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
Now
 

1007
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,470
Now
in context learning lets you solve these

1008
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
in context learning lets you solve these
 

1009
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,510
in context learning lets you solve these
learning problems with a few examples

1010
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
learning problems with a few examples
 

1011
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,029
learning problems with a few examples
without any fine-tuning and no gradient

1012
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
without any fine-tuning and no gradient
 

1013
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,830
without any fine-tuning and no gradient
descent steps at all. You just use the

1014
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:31,840
descent steps at all. You just use the
 

1015
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,310
descent steps at all. You just use the
model. You stuff the examples into

1016
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320
model. You stuff the examples into
 

1017
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,230
model. You stuff the examples into
context

1018
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
context
 

1019
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,630
context
and then you say

1020
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
and then you say
 

1021
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,830
and then you say
go give me the answer. Everyone with me?

1022
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:43,840
go give me the answer. Everyone with me?
 

1023
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,510
go give me the answer. Everyone with me?
So

1024
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
So
 

1025
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,870
So
from GPT3 the idea of thinking about how

1026
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
from GPT3 the idea of thinking about how
 

1027
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,990
from GPT3 the idea of thinking about how
to make a good prompt, how to engineer

1028
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
to make a good prompt, how to engineer
 

1029
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,789
to make a good prompt, how to engineer
context became a big thing. It remains a

1030
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:54,799
context became a big thing. It remains a
 

1031
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,190
context became a big thing. It remains a
big thing. Okay. How to think about the

1032
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
big thing. Okay. How to think about the
 

1033
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,950
big thing. Okay. How to think about the
context and the prompt. But this is

1034
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
context and the prompt. But this is
 

1035
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,029
context and the prompt. But this is
really the point in history when that

1036
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
really the point in history when that
 

1037
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,149
really the point in history when that
happened.

1038
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:04,159

 

1039
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,590

Okay. So now I want to mention one

1040
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
Okay. So now I want to mention one
 

1041
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,549
Okay. So now I want to mention one
challenge to make this happen. We're not

1042
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
challenge to make this happen. We're not
 

1043
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,750
challenge to make this happen. We're not
going to talk that much about this

1044
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:11,760
going to talk that much about this
 

1045
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,470
going to talk that much about this
challenge at this minute, but we will

1046
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
challenge at this minute, but we will
 

1047
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,270
challenge at this minute, but we will
get back to it.

1048
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
get back to it.
 

1049
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,390
get back to it.
To make this work, you have to take all

1050
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
To make this work, you have to take all
 

1051
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,789
To make this work, you have to take all
of your examples, your training data,

1052
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:22,799
of your examples, your training data,
 

1053
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,830
of your examples, your training data,
and they have to fit inside context.

1054
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:25,840
and they have to fit inside context.
 

1055
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,830
and they have to fit inside context.
Does everyone see that? It's just that's

1056
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
Does everyone see that? It's just that's
 

1057
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,190
Does everyone see that? It's just that's
how you it's great. If it's doing in

1058
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
how you it's great. If it's doing in
 

1059
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,710
how you it's great. If it's doing in
context learning, it has to have the

1060
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,720
context learning, it has to have the
 

1061
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,510
context learning, it has to have the
thing it's learning from in the context.

1062
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,520
thing it's learning from in the context.
 

1063
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,350
thing it's learning from in the context.
So if you have a very small number of

1064
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360
So if you have a very small number of
 

1065
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,950
So if you have a very small number of
examples,

1066
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
examples,
 

1067
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,909
examples,
they might fit. And these early models

1068
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
they might fit. And these early models
 

1069
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,549
they might fit. And these early models
were trained with contexts that were

1070
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
were trained with contexts that were
 

1071
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,950
were trained with contexts that were
reasonably short uh by today's

1072
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
reasonably short uh by today's
 

1073
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,669
reasonably short uh by today's
standards, right? They were contexts of,

1074
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:47,679
standards, right? They were contexts of,
 

1075
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,549
standards, right? They were contexts of,
you know, a couple hundred, a thousand,

1076
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
you know, a couple hundred, a thousand,
 

1077
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,669
you know, a couple hundred, a thousand,
2,000. For a long time, 2,000 was the

1078
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
2,000. For a long time, 2,000 was the
 

1079
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,430
2,000. For a long time, 2,000 was the
kind of context length that of tokens

1080
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
kind of context length that of tokens
 

1081
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,430
kind of context length that of tokens
that things could handle. But depending

1082
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:57,440
that things could handle. But depending
 

1083
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,029
that things could handle. But depending
on how many examples you have, 2,000

1084
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
on how many examples you have, 2,000
 

1085
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,029
on how many examples you have, 2,000
isn't that much. And even then there was

1086
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
isn't that much. And even then there was
 

1087
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,789
isn't that much. And even then there was
a question of whether does it really get

1088
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
a question of whether does it really get
 

1089
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,430
a question of whether does it really get
all the value it can from the examples.

1090
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,440
all the value it can from the examples.
 

1091
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,990
all the value it can from the examples.
So lots of work was done at this time

1092
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
So lots of work was done at this time
 

1093
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,510
So lots of work was done at this time
talking about okay you have this in

1094
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
talking about okay you have this in
 

1095
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,270
talking about okay you have this in
context learning ability. You can use it

1096
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,280
context learning ability. You can use it
 

1097
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,669
context learning ability. You can use it
to do these problems. But everything has

1098
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
to do these problems. But everything has
 

1099
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,909
to do these problems. But everything has
to fit in context problem one. Second

1100
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:15,919
to fit in context problem one. Second
 

1101
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,830
to fit in context problem one. Second
problem that people realized is that if

1102
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:17,840
problem that people realized is that if
 

1103
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,270
problem that people realized is that if
you use the embeddings from the model

1104
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,280
you use the embeddings from the model
 

1105
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,710
you use the embeddings from the model
and trained a classifier

1106
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:22,720
and trained a classifier
 

1107
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,990
and trained a classifier
as opposed to having it do it in

1108
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
as opposed to having it do it in
 

1109
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,149
as opposed to having it do it in
context, the train classifier almost

1110
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
context, the train classifier almost
 

1111
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,909
context, the train classifier almost
always did better. Okay, but that's just

1112
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
always did better. Okay, but that's just
 

1113
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,029
always did better. Okay, but that's just
uh what's going on. So this prompted a

1114
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
uh what's going on. So this prompted a
 

1115
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,110
uh what's going on. So this prompted a
huge need uh thinking about how can you

1116
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,120
huge need uh thinking about how can you
 

1117
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,110
huge need uh thinking about how can you
make the context longer. That was one of

1118
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
make the context longer. That was one of
 

1119
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,789
make the context longer. That was one of
the things that made people go to things

1120
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
the things that made people go to things
 

1121
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,470
the things that made people go to things
like rope

1122
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
like rope
 

1123
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,350
like rope
for example because in rope because the

1124
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,360
for example because in rope because the
 

1125
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,870
for example because in rope because the
interpretations of frequencies it was

1126
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
interpretations of frequencies it was
 

1127
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,990
interpretations of frequencies it was
more natural to think about how you

1128
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
more natural to think about how you
 

1129
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,190
more natural to think about how you
could make the context longer

1130
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
could make the context longer
 

1131
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,470
could make the context longer
and nope as well. Um, okay. So,

1132
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:56,480
and nope as well. Um, okay. So,
 

1133
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,549
and nope as well. Um, okay. So,
a whole bunch of lines of active

1134
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:58,559
a whole bunch of lines of active
 

1135
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,310
a whole bunch of lines of active
investigation started after GPT3,

1136
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
investigation started after GPT3,
 

1137
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,070
investigation started after GPT3,
but I want to acknowledge uh the main

1138
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080
but I want to acknowledge uh the main
 

1139
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,830
but I want to acknowledge uh the main
story that I want to get to, which is

1140
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:07,840
story that I want to get to, which is
 

1141
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,750
story that I want to get to, which is
that there's a couple of very natural

1142
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
that there's a couple of very natural
 

1143
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,310
that there's a couple of very natural
questions that happened, which is

1144
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,320
questions that happened, which is
 

1145
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,269
questions that happened, which is
one question is how can you find better

1146
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:17,279
one question is how can you find better
 

1147
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,830
one question is how can you find better
prompts? Clearly these models are now

1148
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:19,840
prompts? Clearly these models are now
 

1149
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,310
prompts? Clearly these models are now
promptable in that you can by picking

1150
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
promptable in that you can by picking
 

1151
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,470
promptable in that you can by picking
the right uh context you can get them to

1152
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,480
the right uh context you can get them to
 

1153
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,710
the right uh context you can get them to
do interesting things. That was already

1154
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:26,720
do interesting things. That was already
 

1155
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,710
do interesting things. That was already
true starting at GPT2 but it came very

1156
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
true starting at GPT2 but it came very
 

1157
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,190
true starting at GPT2 but it came very
true after GPT3.

1158
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
true after GPT3.
 

1159
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,830
true after GPT3.
So then there's this question how do you

1160
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
So then there's this question how do you
 

1161
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,830
So then there's this question how do you
do this? We will come back to this

1162
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840
do this? We will come back to this
 

1163
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,510
do this? We will come back to this
question. It's an important question. We

1164
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,520
question. It's an important question. We
 

1165
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,190
question. It's an important question. We
will come back to it.

1166
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
will come back to it.
 

1167
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,590
will come back to it.
Um the other question that people had

1168
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,600
Um the other question that people had
 

1169
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,590
Um the other question that people had
was

1170
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600
was
 

1171
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,269
was
how can we make models that are more

1172
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:47,279
how can we make models that are more
 

1173
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,110
how can we make models that are more
usefully promptable.

1174
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,120
usefully promptable.
 

1175
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,990
usefully promptable.
Okay. Suddenly you can find the fact

1176
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,000
Okay. Suddenly you can find the fact
 

1177
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,590
Okay. Suddenly you can find the fact
everyone see the kind of evolution of

1178
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
everyone see the kind of evolution of
 

1179
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,909
everyone see the kind of evolution of
this start by saying I can prompt these

1180
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
this start by saying I can prompt these
 

1181
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,590
this start by saying I can prompt these
things and this is useful.

1182
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
things and this is useful.
 

1183
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,590
things and this is useful.
This the question of how can I make

1184
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
This the question of how can I make
 

1185
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,310
This the question of how can I make
these things more useful in this way

1186
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320
these things more useful in this way
 

1187
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,909
these things more useful in this way
this prompting way.

1188
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919

 

1189
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,070

So I'm going to start with B and talk

1190
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
So I'm going to start with B and talk
 

1191
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,310
So I'm going to start with B and talk
about this a little bit. This I think

1192
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,320
about this a little bit. This I think
 

1193
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,590
about this a little bit. This I think
people should be on board with the

1194
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
people should be on board with the
 

1195
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,950
people should be on board with the
history. We'll come back to a lot of the

1196
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:16,960
history. We'll come back to a lot of the
 

1197
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,390
history. We'll come back to a lot of the
stuff technically in a in a moment. So

1198
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400
stuff technically in a in a moment. So
 

1199
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,990
stuff technically in a in a moment. So
there was a very critical paper that

1200
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,000
there was a very critical paper that
 

1201
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,830
there was a very critical paper that
came out in 2021. Notice everything is

1202
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:23,840
came out in 2021. Notice everything is
 

1203
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,350
came out in 2021. Notice everything is
like in one year, right? Um which is

1204
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
like in one year, right? Um which is
 

1205
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,029
like in one year, right? Um which is
called the instruct GPT paper.

1206
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
called the instruct GPT paper.
 

1207
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,470
called the instruct GPT paper.
and instruct GPT was a paper. It was a

1208
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
and instruct GPT was a paper. It was a
 

1209
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,549
and instruct GPT was a paper. It was a
collaborative effort of the research

1210
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
collaborative effort of the research
 

1211
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,029
collaborative effort of the research
teams at uh Google and OpenAI

1212
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:41,039
teams at uh Google and OpenAI
 

1213
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,669
teams at uh Google and OpenAI
and what they wanted to say is how can I

1214
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:43,679
and what they wanted to say is how can I
 

1215
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,149
and what they wanted to say is how can I
make something more usefully promptable

1216
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:46,159
make something more usefully promptable
 

1217
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,830
make something more usefully promptable
which they viewed it as instruction

1218
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840
which they viewed it as instruction
 

1219
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,990
which they viewed it as instruction
following.

1220
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,000
following.
 

1221
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,269
following.
So if you think about it, this kind of

1222
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
So if you think about it, this kind of
 

1223
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,750
So if you think about it, this kind of
uh analogy

1224
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:57,760

 

1225
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,510

is a kind of implicit instruction

1226
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,520
is a kind of implicit instruction
 

1227
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,909
is a kind of implicit instruction
and the autocomplete above is also a

1228
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:05,919
and the autocomplete above is also a
 

1229
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,590
and the autocomplete above is also a
kind of implicit instruction like I'm

1230
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:09,600
kind of implicit instruction like I'm
 

1231
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,630
kind of implicit instruction like I'm
telling you something just complete

1232
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:10,640
telling you something just complete
 

1233
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,789
telling you something just complete
this. So the idea was maybe we can make

1234
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:12,799
this. So the idea was maybe we can make
 

1235
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,590
this. So the idea was maybe we can make
it actually follow instructions.

1236
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
it actually follow instructions.
 

1237
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,990
it actually follow instructions.
So if you take a model like GPT3 or any

1238
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,000
So if you take a model like GPT3 or any
 

1239
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,350
So if you take a model like GPT3 or any
pre-trained model and you ask it, you

1240
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,360
pre-trained model and you ask it, you
 

1241
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,149
pre-trained model and you ask it, you
say the prompt is write me a poem about

1242
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:24,159
say the prompt is write me a poem about
 

1243
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,710
say the prompt is write me a poem about
a cat. Okay, if that's your prompt,

1244
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:26,720
a cat. Okay, if that's your prompt,
 

1245
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,430
a cat. Okay, if that's your prompt,
write me a poem about a cat. The

1246
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,440
write me a poem about a cat. The
 

1247
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,310
write me a poem about a cat. The
autocomplete answer is not going to be a

1248
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
autocomplete answer is not going to be a
 

1249
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,750
autocomplete answer is not going to be a
poem about a cat.

1250
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
poem about a cat.
 

1251
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,269
poem about a cat.
It'll almost never be that.

1252
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:39,279
It'll almost never be that.
 

1253
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,070
It'll almost never be that.
So they the idea was maybe we can make

1254
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
So they the idea was maybe we can make
 

1255
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,590
So they the idea was maybe we can make
it so that if you tell it write me a

1256
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:45,600
it so that if you tell it write me a
 

1257
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,070
it so that if you tell it write me a
poem about a cat it will give you a poem

1258
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,080
poem about a cat it will give you a poem
 

1259
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,310
poem about a cat it will give you a poem
about a cat.

1260
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
about a cat.
 

1261
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,710
about a cat.
So everyone of you who seen so think

1262
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:52,720
So everyone of you who seen so think
 

1263
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,669
So everyone of you who seen so think
about this 2021 fall 2022 is when chat

1264
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:55,679
about this 2021 fall 2022 is when chat
 

1265
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,149
about this 2021 fall 2022 is when chat
GPT came out.

1266
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:58,159
GPT came out.
 

1267
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,669
GPT came out.
Okay. So after this paper was late 2021

1268
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:01,679
Okay. So after this paper was late 2021
 

1269
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,470
Okay. So after this paper was late 2021
um essentially became an all hands-on

1270
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:04,480
um essentially became an all hands-on
 

1271
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,430
um essentially became an all hands-on
deck effort in uh open AI to

1272
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
deck effort in uh open AI to
 

1273
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,029
deck effort in uh open AI to
commercialize that technology.

1274
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
commercialize that technology.
 

1275
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,110
commercialize that technology.
uh so this paper uh instruct GPT is

1276
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,120
uh so this paper uh instruct GPT is
 

1277
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,549
uh so this paper uh instruct GPT is
actually is actually another very very

1278
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
actually is actually another very very
 

1279
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,950
actually is actually another very very
critical paper

1280
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:18,960
critical paper
 

1281
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,029
critical paper
and

1282
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:21,039
and
 

1283
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,110
and
before I move forward I want to

1284
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,120
before I move forward I want to
 

1285
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,669
before I move forward I want to
acknowledge that there's many aspects of

1286
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:25,679
acknowledge that there's many aspects of
 

1287
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,430
acknowledge that there's many aspects of
this paper that are

1288
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
this paper that are
 

1289
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,350
this paper that are
were very important and interesting at

1290
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
were very important and interesting at
 

1291
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,870
were very important and interesting at
the time remain important and

1292
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:32,880
the time remain important and
 

1293
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,950
the time remain important and
interesting but it turns out you'll see

1294
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:34,960
interesting but it turns out you'll see
 

1295
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,750
interesting but it turns out you'll see
in a moment that you didn't need to do

1296
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760
in a moment that you didn't need to do
 

1297
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,190
in a moment that you didn't need to do
all of this in order to get the effect.

1298
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200
all of this in order to get the effect.
 

1299
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,390
all of this in order to get the effect.
Okay, so I'll tell you what you actually

1300
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:42,400
Okay, so I'll tell you what you actually
 

1301
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,470
Okay, so I'll tell you what you actually
need to do in a moment but then but I do

1302
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:44,480
need to do in a moment but then but I do
 

1303
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,310
need to do in a moment but then but I do
want to acknowledge this. So this paper

1304
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
want to acknowledge this. So this paper
 

1305
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,110
want to acknowledge this. So this paper
instruct GPT what it did was it used a

1306
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,120
instruct GPT what it did was it used a
 

1307
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,029
instruct GPT what it did was it used a
combination of techniques many

1308
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
combination of techniques many
 

1309
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,909
combination of techniques many
techniques including a very key idea

1310
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:55,919
techniques including a very key idea
 

1311
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,990
techniques including a very key idea
called reinforcement learning with human

1312
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,000
called reinforcement learning with human
 

1313
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,590
called reinforcement learning with human
feedback

1314
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
feedback
 

1315
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,110
feedback
which we will talk about later because

1316
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120
which we will talk about later because
 

1317
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,870
which we will talk about later because
we need some more technical tools before

1318
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:02,880
we need some more technical tools before
 

1319
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,630
we need some more technical tools before
we can talk about human reinforcement

1320
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:04,640
we can talk about human reinforcement
 

1321
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,950
we can talk about human reinforcement
learning with human feedback. But what

1322
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:06,960
learning with human feedback. But what
 

1323
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,669
learning with human feedback. But what
they said was we're basically at a very

1324
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
they said was we're basically at a very
 

1325
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,389
they said was we're basically at a very
high level. It's that the model isn't

1326
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:12,399
high level. It's that the model isn't
 

1327
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,990
high level. It's that the model isn't
very good at doing this task

1328
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
very good at doing this task
 

1329
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,950
very good at doing this task
to start with, but maybe we can reward

1330
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:18,960
to start with, but maybe we can reward
 

1331
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,669
to start with, but maybe we can reward
it when it does it well. And by

1332
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679
it when it does it well. And by
 

1333
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,510
it when it does it well. And by
rewarding it when it does it well, it'll

1334
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:23,520
rewarding it when it does it well, it'll
 

1335
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,510
rewarding it when it does it well, it'll
get better and better at it. And then

1336
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,520
get better and better at it. And then
 

1337
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,269
get better and better at it. And then
with enough of these rounds of rewarding

1338
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:27,279
with enough of these rounds of rewarding
 

1339
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,389
with enough of these rounds of rewarding
it, it'll be able to do the task. But

1340
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
it, it'll be able to do the task. But
 

1341
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,230
it, it'll be able to do the task. But
it's too expensive to have a human

1342
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,240
it's too expensive to have a human
 

1343
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,190
it's too expensive to have a human
reward it every time. So we'll train a

1344
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
reward it every time. So we'll train a
 

1345
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,669
reward it every time. So we'll train a
machine learning model to act like the

1346
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
machine learning model to act like the
 

1347
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,310
machine learning model to act like the
human and the machine learning model

1348
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
human and the machine learning model
 

1349
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,669
human and the machine learning model
will reward the other machine learning

1350
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:41,679
will reward the other machine learning
 

1351
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,950
will reward the other machine learning
model until it gets good enough and have

1352
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:44,960
model until it gets good enough and have
 

1353
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,950
model until it gets good enough and have
enough human supervision in all this so

1354
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:46,960
enough human supervision in all this so
 

1355
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,110
enough human supervision in all this so
that it gets better and better. Very

1356
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
that it gets better and better. Very
 

1357
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,710
that it gets better and better. Very
short form of what happened in that

1358
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:50,720
short form of what happened in that
 

1359
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,350
short form of what happened in that
paper. We'll talk about all that later

1360
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,360
paper. We'll talk about all that later
 

1361
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,950
paper. We'll talk about all that later
because we technically we're not able to

1362
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
because we technically we're not able to
 

1363
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,310
because we technically we're not able to
express what all the technical tools

1364
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
express what all the technical tools
 

1365
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,710
express what all the technical tools
there are.

1366
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:58,720
there are.
 

1367
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,630
there are.
So, instruct GPT and then the release of

1368
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
So, instruct GPT and then the release of
 

1369
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,149
So, instruct GPT and then the release of
uh of chat GPT in fall 22 was you know

1370
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
uh of chat GPT in fall 22 was you know
 

1371
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,590
uh of chat GPT in fall 22 was you know
huge impact um on the community. But

1372
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:11,600
huge impact um on the community. But
 

1373
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,310
huge impact um on the community. But
people were also very dismayed in that

1374
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,320
people were also very dismayed in that
 

1375
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,909
people were also very dismayed in that
they said the amount of effort both in

1376
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:17,919
they said the amount of effort both in
 

1377
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,070
they said the amount of effort both in
terms of human raiders paying people to

1378
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
terms of human raiders paying people to
 

1379
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,750
terms of human raiders paying people to
do this job and the size of the models

1380
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:23,760
do this job and the size of the models
 

1381
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,990
do this job and the size of the models
and the amount of compute needed to

1382
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
and the amount of compute needed to
 

1383
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,149
and the amount of compute needed to
train was viewed as being completely out

1384
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:28,159
train was viewed as being completely out
 

1385
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,389
train was viewed as being completely out
of reach of ordinary people

1386
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:32,399
of reach of ordinary people
 

1387
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,430
of reach of ordinary people
until people

1388
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,440
until people
 

1389
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,029
until people
figured out that there's actually a way

1390
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:39,039
figured out that there's actually a way
 

1391
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,870
figured out that there's actually a way
to do because that's um easier.

1392
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
to do because that's um easier.
 

1393
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,549
to do because that's um easier.
Okay,

1394
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:44,559
Okay,
 

1395
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,310
Okay,
so

1396
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,320
so
 

1397
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,870
so
core to all of this

1398
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:48,880
core to all of this
 

1399
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,789
core to all of this
is

1400
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:50,799
is
 

1401
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,029
is
fine-tuning a model of this type

1402
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,039
fine-tuning a model of this type
 

1403
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,310
fine-tuning a model of this type
and you can think about it as

1404
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,320
and you can think about it as
 

1405
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,789
and you can think about it as
fine-tuning for instruction following or

1406
00:29:58,789 --> 00:29:58,799
fine-tuning for instruction following or
 

1407
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,990
fine-tuning for instruction following or
for answering questions. Okay, both are

1408
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
for answering questions. Okay, both are
 

1409
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,549
for answering questions. Okay, both are
the same category.

1410
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:04,559
the same category.
 

1411
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,389
the same category.
So suppose you wanted to fine-tune a

1412
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:06,399
So suppose you wanted to fine-tune a
 

1413
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,470
So suppose you wanted to fine-tune a
model and you already have it's already

1414
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
model and you already have it's already
 

1415
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,430
model and you already have it's already
been pre-trained on a whole bunch of

1416
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,440
been pre-trained on a whole bunch of
 

1417
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,950
been pre-trained on a whole bunch of
data. You want to make it good at

1418
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:10,960
data. You want to make it good at
 

1419
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,389
data. You want to make it good at
answering questions or following

1420
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
answering questions or following
 

1421
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,470
answering questions or following
instructions. Basically responding to a

1422
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,480
instructions. Basically responding to a
 

1423
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,549
instructions. Basically responding to a
prompt in a particular way.

1424
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
prompt in a particular way.
 

1425
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,510
prompt in a particular way.
Let's assume you have all the data you

1426
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,520
Let's assume you have all the data you
 

1427
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,789
Let's assume you have all the data you
would ever want. Let's make that

1428
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:22,799
would ever want. Let's make that
 

1429
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,149
would ever want. Let's make that
assumption first. You have all the data

1430
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:24,159
assumption first. You have all the data
 

1431
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,149
assumption first. You have all the data
you would ever want. What kind of data

1432
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:26,159
you would ever want. What kind of data
 

1433
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,269
you would ever want. What kind of data
would you want?

1434
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
would you want?
 

1435
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,950
would you want?
Anyone want to get if you want make

1436
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
Anyone want to get if you want make
 

1437
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,510
Anyone want to get if you want make
something good at answering questions?

1438
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:33,520
something good at answering questions?
 

1439
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,990
something good at answering questions?
What kind of data would you want as

1440
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
What kind of data would you want as
 

1441
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,669
What kind of data would you want as
training data to make something good at

1442
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:37,679
training data to make something good at
 

1443
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,750
training data to make something good at
answering questions?

1444
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:39,760
answering questions?
 

1445
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,510
answering questions?
>> Yeah,

1446
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,520
>> Yeah,
 

1447
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:41,990
>> Yeah,
go ahead.

1448
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,000
go ahead.
 

1449
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,350
go ahead.
>> Question pairs.

1450
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,360
>> Question pairs.
 

1451
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,110
>> Question pairs.
>> Question answer pairs, right? Does

1452
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,120
>> Question answer pairs, right? Does
 

1453
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,669
>> Question answer pairs, right? Does
everyone see that question? Here's the

1454
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:47,679
everyone see that question? Here's the
 

1455
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,310
everyone see that question? Here's the
right answer. So, let's assume we have

1456
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,320
right answer. So, let's assume we have
 

1457
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,950
right answer. So, let's assume we have
that question answer pairs. How do you

1458
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:52,960
that question answer pairs. How do you
 

1459
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,029
that question answer pairs. How do you
tune a model to get better at answering

1460
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
tune a model to get better at answering
 

1461
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,789
tune a model to get better at answering
questions? You're answering question

1462
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:56,799
questions? You're answering question
 

1463
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,830
questions? You're answering question
answer pairs. And the answer is well

1464
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:01,840
answer pairs. And the answer is well
 

1465
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,870
answer pairs. And the answer is well
you set up exactly what you would do at

1466
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:04,880
you set up exactly what you would do at
 

1467
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,990
you set up exactly what you would do at
inference time

1468
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
inference time
 

1469
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,430
inference time
and you follow a teaching forcing

1470
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
and you follow a teaching forcing
 

1471
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,430
and you follow a teaching forcing
strategy. So remember the inference time

1472
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:11,440
strategy. So remember the inference time
 

1473
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,430
strategy. So remember the inference time
picture,

1474
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:13,440
picture,
 

1475
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,470
picture,
right? Inference time picture is you

1476
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,480
right? Inference time picture is you
 

1477
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,750
right? Inference time picture is you
have a start, you have a prompt,

1478
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:19,760
have a start, you have a prompt,
 

1479
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,470
have a start, you have a prompt,
you don't care what happens at the part

1480
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:22,480
you don't care what happens at the part
 

1481
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,070
you don't care what happens at the part
of the prompt because that's coming from

1482
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,080
of the prompt because that's coming from
 

1483
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,830
of the prompt because that's coming from
something else. Then you have the last

1484
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:27,840
something else. Then you have the last
 

1485
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,110
something else. Then you have the last
token of the prompt

1486
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,120
token of the prompt
 

1487
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,990
token of the prompt
and then something. Okay, so before up

1488
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:34,000
and then something. Okay, so before up
 

1489
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,509
and then something. Okay, so before up
here what we had was a sampler.

1490
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:37,519
here what we had was a sampler.
 

1491
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,909
here what we had was a sampler.
But now I have a question answer pair. I

1492
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
But now I have a question answer pair. I
 

1493
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,830
But now I have a question answer pair. I
don't need to sample.

1494
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:41,840
don't need to sample.
 

1495
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,190
don't need to sample.
Does everyone see that? I I know what

1496
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,200
Does everyone see that? I I know what
 

1497
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,230
Does everyone see that? I I know what
the answer is. I want to follow the

1498
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,240
the answer is. I want to follow the
 

1499
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,310
the answer is. I want to follow the
teaching for forcing strategy. So, I'm

1500
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,320
teaching for forcing strategy. So, I'm
 

1501
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,669
teaching for forcing strategy. So, I'm
going to do the exact thing I did at

1502
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:47,679
going to do the exact thing I did at
 

1503
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,269
going to do the exact thing I did at
pre-training,

1504
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
pre-training,
 

1505
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,470
pre-training,
which is I'm going to stick a cross

1506
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:50,480
which is I'm going to stick a cross
 

1507
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,549
which is I'm going to stick a cross
entropy loss here on top

1508
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:54,559
entropy loss here on top
 

1509
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,630
entropy loss here on top
and I'm going to give it the right

1510
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:56,640
and I'm going to give it the right
 

1511
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,990
and I'm going to give it the right
answer

1512
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,000

 

1513
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,789

to compare to.

1514
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:02,799
to compare to.
 

1515
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,070
to compare to.
Okay, does everyone understand this

1516
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
Okay, does everyone understand this
 

1517
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,509
Okay, does everyone understand this
picture?

1518
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:09,519

 

1519
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,750

Very important.

1520
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:13,760

 

1521
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,509

There's no loss on the prompt.

1522
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519

 

1523
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,230

No loss on the prompt. Why is there no

1524
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,240
No loss on the prompt. Why is there no
 

1525
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,950
No loss on the prompt. Why is there no
loss on the prompt? Because we're not

1526
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:24,960
loss on the prompt? Because we're not
 

1527
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,990
loss on the prompt? Because we're not
trying to make it make prompts.

1528
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,000
trying to make it make prompts.
 

1529
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,110
trying to make it make prompts.
We're trying to make it answer

1530
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,120
We're trying to make it answer
 

1531
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,710
We're trying to make it answer
questions. The prompt is just the input.

1532
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:34,720

 

1533
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,190

Okay. So, this is the key distinction

1534
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,200
Okay. So, this is the key distinction
 

1535
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,590
Okay. So, this is the key distinction
when you're doing this kind of uh

1536
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
when you're doing this kind of uh
 

1537
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,630
when you're doing this kind of uh
fine-tuning.

1538
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:42,640

 

1539
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,149

You want to get good at doing the task

1540
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159
You want to get good at doing the task
 

1541
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,070
You want to get good at doing the task
that you want to do, which is give

1542
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,080
that you want to do, which is give
 

1543
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,870
that you want to do, which is give
answers, not the question. At

1544
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:48,880
answers, not the question. At
 

1545
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,789
answers, not the question. At
pre-training,

1546
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
pre-training,
 

1547
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,870
pre-training,
if it saw things, it's it was had a loss

1548
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:52,880
if it saw things, it's it was had a loss
 

1549
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,350
if it saw things, it's it was had a loss
of next token prediction on everything

1550
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:55,360
of next token prediction on everything
 

1551
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,190
of next token prediction on everything
that it saw because it wants to be able

1552
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
that it saw because it wants to be able
 

1553
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,110
that it saw because it wants to be able
to replicate all the patterns in the

1554
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,120
to replicate all the patterns in the
 

1555
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,630
to replicate all the patterns in the
data. So, there's a difference.

1556
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
data. So, there's a difference.
 

1557
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,950
data. So, there's a difference.
Okay,

1558
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:04,960
Okay,
 

1559
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,110
Okay,
everyone with me? Good.

1560
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,120
everyone with me? Good.
 

1561
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,190
everyone with me? Good.
Some people got this a little bit wrong

1562
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,200
Some people got this a little bit wrong
 

1563
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,190
Some people got this a little bit wrong
when they did it in early experiments.

1564
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,200
when they did it in early experiments.
 

1565
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,110
when they did it in early experiments.
They tried to do pre-training on the

1566
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,120
They tried to do pre-training on the
 

1567
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,909
They tried to do pre-training on the
entire question answer pair and they

1568
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:17,919
entire question answer pair and they
 

1569
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,909
entire question answer pair and they
would find weird behaviors like you ask

1570
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:19,919
would find weird behaviors like you ask
 

1571
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,389
would find weird behaviors like you ask
it a question and it like asks you a

1572
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:22,399
it a question and it like asks you a
 

1573
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,070
it a question and it like asks you a
question. It's like a follow on

1574
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,080
question. It's like a follow on
 

1575
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,070
question. It's like a follow on
question,

1576
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
question,
 

1577
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,470
question,
right? Um so this was like in hindsight

1578
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,480
right? Um so this was like in hindsight
 

1579
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,070
right? Um so this was like in hindsight
very clear took some time for people to

1580
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,080
very clear took some time for people to
 

1581
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,909
very clear took some time for people to
realize that you you should do this.

1582
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:33,919
realize that you you should do this.
 

1583
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,830
realize that you you should do this.
Okay, as as many things are research

1584
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:35,840
Okay, as as many things are research
 

1585
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,310
Okay, as as many things are research
wise.

1586
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,320
wise.
 

1587
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,669
wise.
Okay, so why does this work? This works

1588
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
Okay, so why does this work? This works
 

1589
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,590
Okay, so why does this work? This works
because

1590
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:43,600
because
 

1591
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,470
because
these cross entropy losses,

1592
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:46,480
these cross entropy losses,
 

1593
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,190
these cross entropy losses,
they generate gradients.

1594
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200
they generate gradients.
 

1595
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,509
they generate gradients.
Those gradients flow back, hit the DM

1596
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:51,519
Those gradients flow back, hit the DM
 

1597
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,909
Those gradients flow back, hit the DM
better, they hit all these layers going

1598
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919
better, they hit all these layers going
 

1599
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,669
better, they hit all these layers going
down,

1600
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:55,679
down,
 

1601
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,110
down,
right? And then via the attention this

1602
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,120
right? And then via the attention this
 

1603
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,630
right? And then via the attention this
loss then goes back

1604
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
loss then goes back
 

1605
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,070
loss then goes back
to all of these things. Okay, loss goes

1606
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
to all of these things. Okay, loss goes
 

1607
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,990
to all of these things. Okay, loss goes
down goes back to everything and so on.

1608
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,000
down goes back to everything and so on.
 

1609
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,349
down goes back to everything and so on.
All the losses the gradients flow

1610
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:09,359
All the losses the gradients flow
 

1611
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,430
All the losses the gradients flow
through the entire network

1612
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:11,440
through the entire network
 

1613
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,310
through the entire network
just as they were during pre-training.

1614
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,320
just as they were during pre-training.
 

1615
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,869
just as they were during pre-training.
So you can do this kind of fine tuning.

1616
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:16,879
So you can do this kind of fine tuning.
 

1617
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,190
So you can do this kind of fine tuning.
This is called supervised fine tuning

1618
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
This is called supervised fine tuning
 

1619
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,470
This is called supervised fine tuning
generally.

1620
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:22,480

 

1621
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:38,550

Maybe I'll write that one down.

1622
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:38,560

 

1623
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:45,190

sometimes shortened to SFT.

1624
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200

 

1625
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,310

So this is the

1626
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:48,320
So this is the
 

1627
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,589
So this is the
story. But what happened?

1628
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:51,599
story. But what happened?
 

1629
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,669
story. But what happened?
What actually enabled this uh to work

1630
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:55,679
What actually enabled this uh to work
 

1631
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:04,630
What actually enabled this uh to work
was in 2023

1632
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640

 

1633
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:12,390

llama model released.

1634
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,400

 

1635
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,349

So in 2023 what happened was that so

1636
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:15,359
So in 2023 what happened was that so
 

1637
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,870
So in 2023 what happened was that so
this is this is already a part of the

1638
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:16,880
this is this is already a part of the
 

1639
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,510
this is this is already a part of the
technique used to train as one part of

1640
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,520
technique used to train as one part of
 

1641
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,589
technique used to train as one part of
instruct GPD. Okay, there were some

1642
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
instruct GPD. Okay, there were some
 

1643
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,910
instruct GPD. Okay, there were some
examples of human question answer pairs.

1644
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920
examples of human question answer pairs.
 

1645
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,190
examples of human question answer pairs.
The llama model released in 2023 and in

1646
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200
The llama model released in 2023 and in
 

1647
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,589
The llama model released in 2023 and in
by 2023 you also had GPT4 and GPT3.5

1648
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:33,599
by 2023 you also had GPT4 and GPT3.5
 

1649
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,270
by 2023 you also had GPT4 and GPT3.5
were available on chat GPT and people

1650
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,280
were available on chat GPT and people
 

1651
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,150
were available on chat GPT and people
made websites on Reddit and other places

1652
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,160
made websites on Reddit and other places
 

1653
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,069
made websites on Reddit and other places
where they would collect and share

1654
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:42,079
where they would collect and share
 

1655
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,670
where they would collect and share
interesting prompts that they gave to uh

1656
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:45,680
interesting prompts that they gave to uh
 

1657
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,829
interesting prompts that they gave to uh
chat GPT. I was like, "Oh, I asked it to

1658
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:47,839
chat GPT. I was like, "Oh, I asked it to
 

1659
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,270
chat GPT. I was like, "Oh, I asked it to
write this story. Here's my prompt.

1660
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
write this story. Here's my prompt.
 

1661
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,270
write this story. Here's my prompt.
Here's the story." Right. Oh, I asked it

1662
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:51,280
Here's the story." Right. Oh, I asked it
 

1663
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,510
Here's the story." Right. Oh, I asked it
to give me a recipe for this. Here's a

1664
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:53,520
to give me a recipe for this. Here's a
 

1665
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,950
to give me a recipe for this. Here's a
question. Here's a recipe. And people

1666
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:56,960
question. Here's a recipe. And people
 

1667
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,990
question. Here's a recipe. And people
went and scraped Reddit and Twitter and

1668
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
went and scraped Reddit and Twitter and
 

1669
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,790
went and scraped Reddit and Twitter and
collected data sets of the answers that

1670
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:04,800
collected data sets of the answers that
 

1671
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,310
collected data sets of the answers that
it would give to these kind of prompts.

1672
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,320
it would give to these kind of prompts.
 

1673
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,270
it would give to these kind of prompts.
Right? Everyone's with me?

1674
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280
Right? Everyone's with me?
 

1675
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,230
Right? Everyone's with me?
And in 2023, the llama model gets

1676
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,240
And in 2023, the llama model gets
 

1677
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,550
And in 2023, the llama model gets
released. And the law model when they

1678
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,560
released. And the law model when they
 

1679
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,270
released. And the law model when they
released the law model meta they

1680
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
released the law model meta they
 

1681
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,589
released the law model meta they
released it in two versions. They

1682
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:21,599
released it in two versions. They
 

1683
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,589
released it in two versions. They
released one version which was just the

1684
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:23,599
released one version which was just the
 

1685
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,390
released one version which was just the
pre-trained version and they released a

1686
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,400
pre-trained version and they released a
 

1687
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,670
pre-trained version and they released a
second version that was llama after they

1688
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:29,680
second version that was llama after they
 

1689
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,510
second version that was llama after they
had done all of the expensive effort of

1690
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:31,520
had done all of the expensive effort of
 

1691
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,589
had done all of the expensive effort of
instruction fine-tuning.

1692
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599
instruction fine-tuning.
 

1693
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,349
instruction fine-tuning.
So both models released. Um

1694
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:37,359
So both models released. Um
 

1695
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,270
So both models released. Um
so people said hey we can experiment on

1696
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,280
so people said hey we can experiment on
 

1697
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,750
so people said hey we can experiment on
the pre-trained llama model

1698
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:45,760
the pre-trained llama model
 

1699
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,349
the pre-trained llama model
and

1700
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:47,359
and
 

1701
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,030
and
a very important piece of work came out

1702
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,040
a very important piece of work came out
 

1703
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,030
a very important piece of work came out
in 2023 which was called alpaca.

1704
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,040
in 2023 which was called alpaca.
 

1705
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,630
in 2023 which was called alpaca.
So alpaca a kind of llama right and what

1706
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:56,640
So alpaca a kind of llama right and what
 

1707
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,710
So alpaca a kind of llama right and what
they did in alpaca this is work out of

1708
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:58,720
they did in alpaca this is work out of
 

1709
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,750
they did in alpaca this is work out of
uh Stanford they said we're going to

1710
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:01,760
uh Stanford they said we're going to
 

1711
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,430
uh Stanford they said we're going to
take those collected data sets

1712
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,440
take those collected data sets
 

1713
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,990
take those collected data sets
filter them a little bit and we're just

1714
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,000
filter them a little bit and we're just
 

1715
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,790
filter them a little bit and we're just
going to use those data sets only this

1716
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:10,800
going to use those data sets only this
 

1717
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,829
going to use those data sets only this
is all the Reddit scrapes right and

1718
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:13,839
is all the Reddit scrapes right and
 

1719
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,829
is all the Reddit scrapes right and
curated a little bit and we're going to

1720
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
curated a little bit and we're going to
 

1721
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,150
curated a little bit and we're going to
just do an SFT of the pre-training only

1722
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
just do an SFT of the pre-training only
 

1723
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,990
just do an SFT of the pre-training only
llama

1724
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,000

 

1725
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,230

So let me mark make sure this led to

1726
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:26,240
So let me mark make sure this led to
 

1727
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,870
So let me mark make sure this led to
alpaka

1728
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:30,880

 

1729
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,150

and lo and behold

1730
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,160
and lo and behold
 

1731
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,630
and lo and behold
just fine-tuning llama on GPT4s and

1732
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640
just fine-tuning llama on GPT4s and
 

1733
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,589
just fine-tuning llama on GPT4s and
GPT3.5's answers I think I think they

1734
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:41,599
GPT3.5's answers I think I think they
 

1735
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,790
GPT3.5's answers I think I think they
finally uh collected it to just GPT3.5

1736
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:44,800
finally uh collected it to just GPT3.5
 

1737
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,030
finally uh collected it to just GPT3.5
answers for having a better experiment.

1738
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,040
answers for having a better experiment.
 

1739
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,430
answers for having a better experiment.
Um, GP3.5 answers.

1740
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:51,440
Um, GP3.5 answers.
 

1741
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,670
Um, GP3.5 answers.
Suddenly, Llama could follow

1742
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:53,680
Suddenly, Llama could follow
 

1743
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,270
Suddenly, Llama could follow
instructions.

1744
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:57,280

 

1745
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,470

Everyone see that? So it turned out to

1746
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:00,480
Everyone see that? So it turned out to
 

1747
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,910
Everyone see that? So it turned out to
get a model to actually follow

1748
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:01,920
get a model to actually follow
 

1749
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,270
get a model to actually follow
instructions, you don't need to actually

1750
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,280
instructions, you don't need to actually
 

1751
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,150
instructions, you don't need to actually
give it all of the RL with human

1752
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,160
give it all of the RL with human
 

1753
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,870
give it all of the RL with human
feedback and all having a reward model

1754
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:12,880
feedback and all having a reward model
 

1755
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,790
feedback and all having a reward model
that's trained with humans and

1756
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:14,800
that's trained with humans and
 

1757
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,950
that's trained with humans and
comparisons and all the machinery that

1758
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:16,960
comparisons and all the machinery that
 

1759
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,230
comparisons and all the machinery that
was part of instruct GPT. All you needed

1760
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,240
was part of instruct GPT. All you needed
 

1761
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,670
was part of instruct GPT. All you needed
was a whole bunch of data that was

1762
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:23,680
was a whole bunch of data that was
 

1763
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,670
was a whole bunch of data that was
instruction following. And then people

1764
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,680
instruction following. And then people
 

1765
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,510
instruction following. And then people
stepped back and understood, oh, now we

1766
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:27,520
stepped back and understood, oh, now we
 

1767
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,589
stepped back and understood, oh, now we
know what the problem was. The problem

1768
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:29,599
know what the problem was. The problem
 

1769
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,589
know what the problem was. The problem
was is that the large corpus of

1770
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:31,599
was is that the large corpus of
 

1771
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,589
was is that the large corpus of
Wikipedia and text that's out there

1772
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:35,599
Wikipedia and text that's out there
 

1773
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,910
Wikipedia and text that's out there
doesn't have instruction following well

1774
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:37,920
doesn't have instruction following well
 

1775
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,829
doesn't have instruction following well
represented because it's not normal pros

1776
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:41,839
represented because it's not normal pros
 

1777
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,710
represented because it's not normal pros
like you don't maybe in sometimes in a

1778
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:44,720
like you don't maybe in sometimes in a
 

1779
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,790
like you don't maybe in sometimes in a
novel someone says hey do this and then

1780
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:46,800
novel someone says hey do this and then
 

1781
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,390
novel someone says hey do this and then
someone does this but it's not like a

1782
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:48,400
someone does this but it's not like a
 

1783
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,430
someone does this but it's not like a
common thing but it's a really common

1784
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,440
common thing but it's a really common
 

1785
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,910
common thing but it's a really common
thing for what you want. So there's a

1786
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:53,920
thing for what you want. So there's a
 

1787
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,910
thing for what you want. So there's a
huge mismatch in distributions.

1788
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:57,920
huge mismatch in distributions.
 

1789
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,990
huge mismatch in distributions.
So getting the right kind of data

1790
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,000
So getting the right kind of data
 

1791
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,510
So getting the right kind of data
distribution was critical.

1792
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,520
distribution was critical.
 

1793
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,030
distribution was critical.
Um

1794
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,040
Um
 

1795
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:15,030
Um
so this showed

1796
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,040

 

1797
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,589

instruction

1798
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:17,599
instruction
 

1799
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,150
instruction
following

1800
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,160
following
 

1801
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,510
following
examples.

1802
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:23,520

 

1803
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,550

are key.

1804
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:26,560
are key.
 

1805
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,270
are key.
Now the important thing here is that

1806
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:29,280
Now the important thing here is that
 

1807
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,950
Now the important thing here is that
alpaca

1808
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:30,960
alpaca
 

1809
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,069
alpaca
does definitely generalized, right? What

1810
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:34,079
does definitely generalized, right? What
 

1811
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,030
does definitely generalized, right? What
do we generalized? So maybe it was asked

1812
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,040
do we generalized? So maybe it was asked
 

1813
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,950
do we generalized? So maybe it was asked
in the training training data set, give

1814
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:38,960
in the training training data set, give
 

1815
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,710
in the training training data set, give
me a recipe for something.

1816
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:42,720
me a recipe for something.
 

1817
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,870
me a recipe for something.
You could ask it for a totally different

1818
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:44,880
You could ask it for a totally different
 

1819
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,030
You could ask it for a totally different
recipe and it would follow the

1820
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,040
recipe and it would follow the
 

1821
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,870
recipe and it would follow the
instructions and give you a recipe for

1822
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:48,880
instructions and give you a recipe for
 

1823
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,190
instructions and give you a recipe for
something totally different. It wasn't

1824
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:51,200
something totally different. It wasn't
 

1825
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,030
something totally different. It wasn't
that it just knew how to replicate the

1826
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,040
that it just knew how to replicate the
 

1827
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,349
that it just knew how to replicate the
examples that it was taught. It had

1828
00:39:57,349 --> 00:39:57,359
examples that it was taught. It had
 

1829
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,190
examples that it was taught. It had
captured the idea of instruction

1830
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
captured the idea of instruction
 

1831
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,190
captured the idea of instruction
following itself.

1832
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,200

 

1833
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,190

So alpaca one cannot like the importance

1834
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,200
So alpaca one cannot like the importance
 

1835
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,430
So alpaca one cannot like the importance
of llama in the history is kind of very

1836
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:09,440
of llama in the history is kind of very
 

1837
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,870
of llama in the history is kind of very
important because the first very large

1838
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:10,880
important because the first very large
 

1839
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,550
important because the first very large
model that was open that had both the

1840
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
model that was open that had both the
 

1841
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,030
model that was open that had both the
pre-training GPT3 was not open still is

1842
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,040
pre-training GPT3 was not open still is
 

1843
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,589
pre-training GPT3 was not open still is
not open. Um

1844
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:17,599
not open. Um
 

1845
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:27,829
not open. Um
yeah question. How do you know?

1846
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:27,839

 

1847
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,589

>> That's a great question. So the alpaca

1848
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:31,599
>> That's a great question. So the alpaca
 

1849
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,430
>> That's a great question. So the alpaca
data set was scraped out of this very um

1850
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:35,440
data set was scraped out of this very um
 

1851
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,829
data set was scraped out of this very um
powerful model GP 3.5 which had all the

1852
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:37,839
powerful model GP 3.5 which had all the
 

1853
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,630
powerful model GP 3.5 which had all the
work that was done and so it might have

1854
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
work that was done and so it might have
 

1855
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,710
work that was done and so it might have
hallucinations and bugs in it. So when

1856
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:42,720
hallucinations and bugs in it. So when
 

1857
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,630
hallucinations and bugs in it. So when
people cured the alpaca data set they

1858
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
people cured the alpaca data set they
 

1859
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,870
people cured the alpaca data set they
actually chose high quality examples.

1860
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:46,880
actually chose high quality examples.
 

1861
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,109
actually chose high quality examples.
Okay. So they had they had they went and

1862
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:49,119
Okay. So they had they had they went and
 

1863
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,870
Okay. So they had they had they went and
chose high quality examples. None of

1864
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:50,880
chose high quality examples. None of
 

1865
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,190
chose high quality examples. None of
this doesn't cure the problem of

1866
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,200
this doesn't cure the problem of
 

1867
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,710
this doesn't cure the problem of
hallucinations. Those are those are

1868
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:54,720
hallucinations. Those are those are
 

1869
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,790
hallucinations. Those are those are
there still today, right? They're always

1870
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:56,800
there still today, right? They're always
 

1871
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,550
there still today, right? They're always
there. Um but you bring up a very

1872
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:00,560
there. Um but you bring up a very
 

1873
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,910
there. Um but you bring up a very
important point which is there was a key

1874
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:03,920
important point which is there was a key
 

1875
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,550
important point which is there was a key
question here which was did this work

1876
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
question here which was did this work
 

1877
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,069
question here which was did this work
because these these generations were

1878
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:12,079
because these these generations were
 

1879
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,309
because these these generations were
actually out of a synthetic system?

1880
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:16,319
actually out of a synthetic system?
 

1881
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,829
actually out of a synthetic system?
Like what was happening here? Was it

1882
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:17,839
Like what was happening here? Was it
 

1883
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:18,950
Like what was happening here? Was it
happening because there's a kind of

1884
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:18,960
happening because there's a kind of
 

1885
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,470
happening because there's a kind of
alignment happening between Llama's data

1886
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:22,480
alignment happening between Llama's data
 

1887
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,270
alignment happening between Llama's data
set which I don't think they released

1888
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:25,280
set which I don't think they released
 

1889
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,870
set which I don't think they released
the exact full nature of their training

1890
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:26,880
the exact full nature of their training
 

1891
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,030
the exact full nature of their training
data set but it probably had the same

1892
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,040
data set but it probably had the same
 

1893
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,750
data set but it probably had the same
kind of stuff that GPT355 was trained

1894
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:31,760
kind of stuff that GPT355 was trained
 

1895
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,990
kind of stuff that GPT355 was trained
on. It's different architecture but had

1896
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,000
on. It's different architecture but had
 

1897
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,750
on. It's different architecture but had
similar stuff. It definitely had

1898
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:35,760
similar stuff. It definitely had
 

1899
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,190
similar stuff. It definitely had
different human raiders because OpenAI

1900
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,200
different human raiders because OpenAI
 

1901
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,309
different human raiders because OpenAI
didn't release their human raiders. So

1902
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:38,319
didn't release their human raiders. So
 

1903
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,349
didn't release their human raiders. So
their reward model is definitely

1904
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:39,359
their reward model is definitely
 

1905
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,670
their reward model is definitely

different but there's some amount of
 

1907
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,670
different but there's some amount of
overlap in the training set quite

1908
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
overlap in the training set quite
 

1909
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,589
overlap in the training set quite
substantial. for example, we know both

1910
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:45,599
substantial. for example, we know both
 

1911
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,550
substantial. for example, we know both
of them have very heavy emphasis on like

1912
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,560
of them have very heavy emphasis on like

1914
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:50,880

1915
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,550

like this, right? Because high quality

1916
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:52,560

stuff that's out there.
 

1919
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,589
stuff that's out there.
And so there was this question of

1920
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:57,599
And so there was this question of
 

1921
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,670
And so there was this question of
was this working because you had enough

1922
00:41:59,670 --> 00:41:59,680
was this working because you had enough
 

1923
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,069
was this working because you had enough
instruction following examples

1924
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:02,079
instruction following examples
 

1925
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,150
instruction following examples
or was it working because you had

1926
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,160
or was it working because you had
 

1927
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,990
or was it working because you had
instruction following examples from a

1928
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,000
instruction following examples from a
 

1929
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,069
instruction following examples from a
model that was trained this way. Does

1930
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
model that was trained this way. Does

everyone see the qu the thing? There's
 

1933
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,309

So amazingly

1974
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:07,760
So amazingly
 

1975
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,829
So amazingly
this was solved in the most creative and

1976
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:09,839
this was solved in the most creative and
 

1977
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,069
this was solved in the most creative and
interesting way as a story. I really

1978
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:12,079
interesting way as a story. I really
 

1979
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,990
interesting way as a story. I really
like the story is that data bricks made

1980
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,000
like the story is that data bricks made
 

1981
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,550
like the story is that data bricks made
released dolly. So the problem here was

1982
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:18,560
released dolly. So the problem here was
 

1983
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,309
released dolly. So the problem here was
actually due to copyright and licensing.

1984
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:22,319
actually due to copyright and licensing.
 

1985
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,829
actually due to copyright and licensing.
So usually we don't talk about history

1986
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:23,839
So usually we don't talk about history
 

1987
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,430
So usually we don't talk about history
but here the history is interesting and

1988
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:25,440
but here the history is interesting and
 

1989
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,870
but here the history is interesting and
it's good for people who didn't live

1990
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
it's good for people who didn't live
 

1991
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,670
it's good for people who didn't live
through it to know it a little bit. So

1992
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:31,680
through it to know it a little bit. So
 

1993
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,589
through it to know it a little bit. So
data brick said look there's a problem.

1994
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:33,599
data brick said look there's a problem.

Okay,

2002
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:44,400
Okay,
 

2003
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,990
Okay,
there's a separate question. The

2004
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,000
there's a separate question. The
 

2005
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,230
there's a separate question. The
copyright office had issued a ruling

2006
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,240
copyright office had issued a ruling
 

2007
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,230
copyright office had issued a ruling
that said all AI generated text is not

2008
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
that said all AI generated text is not
 

2009
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,710
that said all AI generated text is not
copyrighted. So what does a license mean

2010
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:52,720
copyrighted. So what does a license mean
 

2011
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,790
copyrighted. So what does a license mean
on something that has no copyright?

2012
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:54,800
on something that has no copyright?
 

2013
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,790
on something that has no copyright?
Okay, se separate question. So people

2014
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:56,800
Okay, se separate question. So people
 

2015
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,190
Okay, se separate question. So people
weren't that worried, but data bricks is

2016
00:43:59,190 --> 00:43:59,200
weren't that worried, but data bricks is
 

2017
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,109
weren't that worried, but data bricks is
a company. They have a large valuation,

2018
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
a company. They have a large valuation,
 

2019
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,710
a company. They have a large valuation,
you know, that kind of matters for them.

2020
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:02,720
you know, that kind of matters for them.
 

2021
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,109
you know, that kind of matters for them.
So they're like, would it be cool if we

2022
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:05,119
So they're like, would it be cool if we
 

2023
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,190
So they're like, would it be cool if we
could do this without using

2024
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,200
could do this without using
 

2025
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,510
could do this without using
instructionated things? So the size of

2026
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:09,520
instructionated things? So the size of
 

2027
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,270
instructionated things? So the size of
the alpaca data set is in the tens of

2028
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:11,280
the alpaca data set is in the tens of
 

2029
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,870
the alpaca data set is in the tens of
thousands.

2030
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:12,880
thousands.
 

2031
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,069
thousands.
So the question was, can you get a human

2032
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:16,079
So the question was, can you get a human
 

2033
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,550
So the question was, can you get a human
generated fresh data set of just

2034
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:18,560
generated fresh data set of just
 

2035
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,030
generated fresh data set of just
instruction following?

2036
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,040
instruction following?
 

2037
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,109
instruction following?
And data bricks said, hey employees, if

00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,550
was just examples of instruction
following that you needed and it wasn't

2066
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:58,560
following that you needed and it wasn't
 

2067
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,109
following that you needed and it wasn't
a GPT ism because they lo data was you

2068
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:01,119
a GPT ism because they lo data was you
 

2069
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,550
a GPT ism because they lo data was you
knew exactly what the training data set

2070
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,560
knew exactly what the training data set
 

2071
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,589
knew exactly what the training data set
was because it was open and released.

2072
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:05,599
was because it was open and released.
 

2073
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,589
was because it was open and released.
So

2074
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:07,599
So
 

2075
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,069
So
this showed

2076
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:12,079

 

2077
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,150

it was enough examples

2078
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:18,160

 

2079
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,510

that mattered.

2080
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520

 

2081
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,470

Okay. So

2082
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:30,480

 

2083
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,030

after these results came out and this

2084
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,040
after these results came out and this
 

2085
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,870
after these results came out and this
SFT, this launched an entire

2086
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
SFT, this launched an entire
 

2087
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,870
SFT, this launched an entire
sea of lots of people doing all kinds of

2088
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:40,880
sea of lots of people doing all kinds of
 

2089
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,190
sea of lots of people doing all kinds of
fine-tunes, collecting data sets, trying

2090
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:43,200
fine-tunes, collecting data sets, trying
 

2091
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,790
fine-tunes, collecting data sets, trying
to get models to take certain do better

2092
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:46,800
to get models to take certain do better
 

2093
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,390
to get models to take certain do better
in certain genres, do better with

2094
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:48,400
in certain genres, do better with
 

2095
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,870
in certain genres, do better with
certain kinds of instructions and so on.

2096
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
certain kinds of instructions and so on.
 

2097
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,470
certain kinds of instructions and so on.
So huge amount of people work on this

2098
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:54,480
So huge amount of people work on this
 

2099
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,550
So huge amount of people work on this
problem, many of whom are just hobbyists

2100
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:56,560
problem, many of whom are just hobbyists
 

2101
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,390
problem, many of whom are just hobbyists
because there's code released that made

2102
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:58,400
because there's code released that made
 

2103
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,390
because there's code released that made
it easy for people to do this. People

2104
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,400
it easy for people to do this. People
 

2105
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,430
it easy for people to do this. People
got code like this to run on collab and

2106
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:03,440
got code like this to run on collab and
 

2107
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,550
got code like this to run on collab and
like just a whole so if you go on

2108
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:06,560
like just a whole so if you go on
 

2109
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,750
like just a whole so if you go on
hugging face you can see thousands upon

2110
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,760
hugging face you can see thousands upon
 

2111
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,630
hugging face you can see thousands upon
thousands of fine tunes that do all

2112
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,640
thousands of fine tunes that do all
 

2113
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,309
thousands of fine tunes that do all
kinds of like small crazy things.

2114
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:18,319

 

2115
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,750

Okay, so this is a basic technique

2116
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:19,760
Okay, so this is a basic technique
 

2117
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,230
Okay, so this is a basic technique
though. This is what you're doing. Now

2118
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:22,240
though. This is what you're doing. Now
 

2119
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,510
though. This is what you're doing. Now
there's more nuance

2120
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,520
there's more nuance
 

2121
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,910
there's more nuance
um which we'll talk about later that

2122
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:29,920
um which we'll talk about later that
 

2123
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,790
um which we'll talk about later that
this work showed that this is the key to

2124
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
this work showed that this is the key to
 

2125
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,710
this work showed that this is the key to
get instruction following but to get

2126
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:34,720
get instruction following but to get
 

2127
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,589
get instruction following but to get
really good instruction following

2128
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:37,599
really good instruction following
 

2129
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,069
really good instruction following
needs more. Okay. And that's we'll talk

2130
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:40,079
needs more. Okay. And that's we'll talk
 

2131
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,150
needs more. Okay. And that's we'll talk
about when we talk about RLHF but we

2132
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,160
about when we talk about RLHF but we
 

2133
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,589
about when we talk about RLHF but we
need more tools before we can get there.

2134
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:45,599
need more tools before we can get there.
 

2135
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,430
need more tools before we can get there.
Okay, so

2136
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,440

 

2137
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,390

now step back. Let's talk about

2138
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:52,400
now step back. Let's talk about
 

2139
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,470
now step back. Let's talk about
fine-tuning. So fair trade models, how

2140
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,480
fine-tuning. So fair trade models, how
 

2141
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,510
fine-tuning. So fair trade models, how
can you use them? Now in our world, so

2142
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:57,520
can you use them? Now in our world, so
 

2143
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,230
can you use them? Now in our world, so
when we started the class, we talked

2144
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:00,240
when we started the class, we talked
 

2145
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,349
when we started the class, we talked
about kind of these two approaches of

2146
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:03,359
about kind of these two approaches of
 

2147
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,589
about kind of these two approaches of
how you do a fine tune.

2148
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:05,599
how you do a fine tune.
 

2149
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,990
how you do a fine tune.
An approach here which said, hey, I'm

2150
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,000
An approach here which said, hey, I'm
 

2151
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,030
An approach here which said, hey, I'm
going to treat the model, the

2152
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:09,040
going to treat the model, the
 

2153
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,309
going to treat the model, the
pre-trained model, freeze it, and just

2154
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:12,319
pre-trained model, freeze it, and just
 

2155
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,349
pre-trained model, freeze it, and just
use it as a feature generator. I'll take

2156
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:15,359
use it as a feature generator. I'll take
 

2157
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,109
use it as a feature generator. I'll take
its features and do classical ML to my

2158
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:19,119
its features and do classical ML to my
 

2159
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,190
its features and do classical ML to my
problem.

2160
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,200
problem.
 

2161
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,550
problem.
Okay, this is also sometimes called

2162
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:22,560
Okay, this is also sometimes called
 

2163
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,790
Okay, this is also sometimes called
linear probing

2164
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:24,800
linear probing
 

2165
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,550
linear probing
because oftentimes the classical ML

2166
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:26,560
because oftentimes the classical ML
 

2167
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,829
because oftentimes the classical ML
technique you're going to do is just

2168
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:27,839
technique you're going to do is just
 

2169
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,390
technique you're going to do is just
going to use a linear classifier

2170
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:30,400
going to use a linear classifier
 

2171
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,510
going to use a linear classifier
or basic linear model

2172
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:33,520
or basic linear model
 

2173
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,309
or basic linear model
and you can choose where to look for the

2174
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:36,319
and you can choose where to look for the
 

2175
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,150
and you can choose where to look for the
probe. So for example in BERT

2176
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
probe. So for example in BERT
 

2177
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,150
probe. So for example in BERT
you can look at the embeddings at the

2178
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,160
you can look at the embeddings at the
 

2179
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,349
you can look at the embeddings at the
last layer. totally normal thing to do.

2180
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:45,359
last layer. totally normal thing to do.
 

2181
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,710
last layer. totally normal thing to do.
You could also look at the embeddings at

2182
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,720
You could also look at the embeddings at
 

2183
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,710
You could also look at the embeddings at
the layer before the last layer. You

2184
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:48,720
the layer before the last layer. You
 

2185
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,150
the layer before the last layer. You
could also look at the embeddings in the

2186
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:50,160
could also look at the embeddings in the
 

2187
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,150
could also look at the embeddings in the
layer before that. You could choose to

2188
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:52,160
layer before that. You could choose to
 

2189
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,230
layer before that. You could choose to
average the embeddings across the top 10

2190
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:54,240
average the embeddings across the top 10
 

2191
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,950
average the embeddings across the top 10
layers. Lots of such choices exist and

2192
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:56,960
layers. Lots of such choices exist and
 

2193
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,390
layers. Lots of such choices exist and
work better and worse in certain cases.

2194
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,400
work better and worse in certain cases.
 

2195
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,990
work better and worse in certain cases.
So lots of creativity can happen as

2196
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:00,000
So lots of creativity can happen as
 

2197
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,589
So lots of creativity can happen as
using a feature extractor, but you

2198
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:01,599
using a feature extractor, but you
 

2199
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,109
using a feature extractor, but you
freeze the model. You never touch the

2200
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:03,119
freeze the model. You never touch the
 

2201
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,589
freeze the model. You never touch the
pre-trained model. So we talked about

2202
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:05,599
pre-trained model. So we talked about
 

2203
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,670
pre-trained model. So we talked about
stuff like this before. And then we

2204
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
stuff like this before. And then we
 

2205
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,069
stuff like this before. And then we
talked about doing a full fine tune. You

2206
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:10,079
talked about doing a full fine tune. You
 

2207
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,990
talked about doing a full fine tune. You
take the entire model and you fully

2208
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,000
take the entire model and you fully
 

2209
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,510
take the entire model and you fully
fine-tune it. you let all the weights

2210
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:13,520
fine-tune it. you let all the weights
 

2211
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,390
fine-tune it. you let all the weights
move and adjust for your new task.

2212
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,400
move and adjust for your new task.
 

2213
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,309
move and adjust for your new task.
With GPT3,

2214
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:18,319
With GPT3,
 

2215
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,190
With GPT3,
you had this pure prompting strategy

2216
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:21,200
you had this pure prompting strategy
 

2217
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,030
you had this pure prompting strategy
also.

2218
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:25,040

 

2219
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,670

So now what we're going to talk about is

2220
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:27,680
So now what we're going to talk about is
 

2221
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,069
So now what we're going to talk about is
how to go beyond these three basic

2222
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:30,079
how to go beyond these three basic
 

2223
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,990
how to go beyond these three basic
things.

2224
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,000
things.
 

2225
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,910
things.
And a way to think about it is we're

2226
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:33,920
And a way to think about it is we're
 

2227
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,829
And a way to think about it is we're
going to think about first uh 0.5.

2228
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:39,839

 

2229
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,309

Okay?

2230
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:42,319
Okay?
 

2231
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,710
Okay?
And then we're gonna talk about how to

2232
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:46,720
And then we're gonna talk about how to
 

2233
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,829
And then we're gonna talk about how to
do a 1.5.

2234
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:49,839
do a 1.5.
 

2235
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,870
do a 1.5.
Okay. After we see what happens with

2236
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:52,880
Okay. After we see what happens with
 

2237
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,390
Okay. After we see what happens with
0.5.

2238
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400

 

2239
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,190

So pause here

2240
00:48:59,190 --> 00:48:59,200
So pause here
 

2241
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,990
So pause here
everyone see the big picture. So now in

2242
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,000
everyone see the big picture. So now in
 

2243
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,470
everyone see the big picture. So now in
the history of what's going on, we have

2244
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:04,480
the history of what's going on, we have
 

2245
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,030
the history of what's going on, we have
models that are pre-trained on lots of

2246
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:07,040
models that are pre-trained on lots of
 

2247
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,069
models that are pre-trained on lots of
data. It turns out that if you want to

2248
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:10,079
data. It turns out that if you want to
 

2249
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,589
data. It turns out that if you want to
get them to be good at something, you

2250
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:11,599
get them to be good at something, you
 

2251
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,270
get them to be good at something, you
give lots of examples of that and

2252
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:13,280
give lots of examples of that and
 

2253
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,109
give lots of examples of that and
fine-tune them, they can get good at it.

2254
00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:15,119
fine-tune them, they can get good at it.
 

2255
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,710
fine-tune them, they can get good at it.
That's all this in this full fine-tuned

2256
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:16,720
That's all this in this full fine-tuned
 

2257
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,790
That's all this in this full fine-tuned
strategy.

2258
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:18,800
strategy.
 

2259
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,069
strategy.
Once they're good at that, you could

2260
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:20,079
Once they're good at that, you could
 

2261
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,309
Once they're good at that, you could
then use it a pure prompting strategy or

2262
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:22,319
then use it a pure prompting strategy or
 

2263
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:27,430
then use it a pure prompting strategy or
you could again use it as an embedding.

2264
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:27,440

 

2265
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,150

Okay, so

2266
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:30,160
Okay, so
 

2267
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,150
Okay, so
return to our question A from above. How

2268
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,160
return to our question A from above. How
 

2269
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,150
return to our question A from above. How
do we get better prompts? Look at the

2270
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:34,160
do we get better prompts? Look at the
 

2271
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,190
do we get better prompts? Look at the
pure prompting strategy.

2272
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:37,200
pure prompting strategy.
 

2273
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,950
pure prompting strategy.
So

2274
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:38,960
So
 

2275
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,230
So
again the history of this is

2276
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:40,240
again the history of this is
 

2277
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,390
again the history of this is
interesting. When people started off and

2278
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,400
interesting. When people started off and
 

2279
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,870
interesting. When people started off and
it turned out that prompting mattered

2280
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:44,880
it turned out that prompting mattered
 

2281
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,950
it turned out that prompting mattered
people did all kinds of chat was

2282
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:46,960
people did all kinds of chat was
 

2283
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,710
people did all kinds of chat was
released and you had a whole group of

2284
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:48,720
released and you had a whole group of
 

2285
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,510
released and you had a whole group of
people online just ordinary people

2286
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:51,520
people online just ordinary people
 

2287
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,870
people online just ordinary people
playing with this that are not

2288
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:52,880
playing with this that are not
 

2289
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,750
playing with this that are not
researchers and they were reporting

2290
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:55,760
researchers and they were reporting
 

2291
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,069
researchers and they were reporting
their findings on Reddit and Twitter and

2292
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
their findings on Reddit and Twitter and
 

2293
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,309
their findings on Reddit and Twitter and
all these other places. And you had all

2294
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:00,319
all these other places. And you had all
 

2295
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,870
all these other places. And you had all
people people saying,"Wait, it turns out

2296
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:02,880
people people saying,"Wait, it turns out
 

2297
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,990
people people saying,"Wait, it turns out
if I tell it, you know, if I'm mean to

2298
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
if I tell it, you know, if I'm mean to
 

2299
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,150
if I tell it, you know, if I'm mean to
it, it sometimes helps, right? If I'm

2300
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:08,160
it, it sometimes helps, right? If I'm
 

2301
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,309
it, it sometimes helps, right? If I'm
rude to it, it helps. Or if I flatter

2302
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:10,319
rude to it, it helps. Or if I flatter
 

2303
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,950
rude to it, it helps. Or if I flatter
it, it helps, right? All kinds of like

2304
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
it, it helps, right? All kinds of like
 

2305
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,910
it, it helps, right? All kinds of like
weird behaviors were being reported. And

2306
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:15,920
weird behaviors were being reported. And
 

2307
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,589
weird behaviors were being reported. And
so, how to get better prompts was uh

2308
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
so, how to get better prompts was uh
 

2309
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,230
so, how to get better prompts was uh
became a kind of a craft skill that

2310
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:22,240
became a kind of a craft skill that
 

2311
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,990
became a kind of a craft skill that
people had to figure out and learn.

2312
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,000
people had to figure out and learn.
 

2313
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,829
people had to figure out and learn.
And

2314
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
And
 

2315
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,390
And
then of course people's like okay how

2316
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:30,400
then of course people's like okay how
 

2317
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,990
then of course people's like okay how
can we do this more systematically? Can

2318
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:32,000
can we do this more systematically? Can
 

2319
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,390
can we do this more systematically? Can
we do it more systematically? So here

2320
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:34,400
we do it more systematically? So here
 

2321
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,030
we do it more systematically? So here
before I talk about 0.5 I want to talk

2322
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:37,040
before I talk about 0.5 I want to talk
 

2323
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,470
before I talk about 0.5 I want to talk
about something which is not in scope

2324
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:38,480
about something which is not in scope
 

2325
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,670
about something which is not in scope
for the class but you should know about.

2326
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:41,680
for the class but you should know about.
 

2327
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,510
for the class but you should know about.
So, this is an aside.

2328
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520

 

2329
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,030

If you actually want to do a better

2330
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,040
If you actually want to do a better
 

2331
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,470
If you actually want to do a better
prompt and you have only API access to

2332
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:52,480
prompt and you have only API access to
 

2333
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,990
prompt and you have only API access to
the model, which means you can't

2334
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:54,000
the model, which means you can't
 

2335
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,670
the model, which means you can't
actually look at the model, look at its

2336
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:55,680
actually look at the model, look at its
 

2337
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,750
actually look at the model, look at its
weights or what's going on inside of it.

2338
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:57,760
weights or what's going on inside of it.
 

2339
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,069
weights or what's going on inside of it.
You just have you only have the model

2340
00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:00,079
You just have you only have the model
 

2341
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,950
You just have you only have the model
itself,

2342
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
itself,
 

2343
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,349
itself,
then there are actually tools out there

2344
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:05,359
then there are actually tools out there
 

2345
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,349
then there are actually tools out there
that will help you systematically get

2346
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:07,359
that will help you systematically get
 

2347
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,349
that will help you systematically get
better prompts.

2348
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:09,359
better prompts.
 

2349
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,349
better prompts.
So one of the most popular kind of

2350
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
So one of the most popular kind of
 

2351
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,950
So one of the most popular kind of
packages families is something called

2352
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:12,960
packages families is something called
 

2353
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,630
packages families is something called
DSPY.

2354
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:14,640
DSPY.
 

2355
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,670
DSPY.
Has anyone here used it? Few of you, a

2356
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:17,680
Has anyone here used it? Few of you, a
 

2357
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,390
Has anyone here used it? Few of you, a
couple of you. Yeah. So you want to use

2358
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:20,400
couple of you. Yeah. So you want to use
 

2359
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,430
couple of you. Yeah. So you want to use
this because it has it always

2360
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:21,440
this because it has it always
 

2361
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,990
this because it has it always
incorporates new algorithms into it. So

2362
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,000
incorporates new algorithms into it. So
 

2363
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,190
incorporates new algorithms into it. So
just in terms of like if you want to

2364
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
just in terms of like if you want to
 

2365
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,870
just in terms of like if you want to
know like time frame, there's a new

2366
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:26,880
know like time frame, there's a new
 

2367
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,069
know like time frame, there's a new
algorithm that came out this summer

2368
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
algorithm that came out this summer
 

2369
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,349
algorithm that came out this summer
called GPA. It's a Berkeley algorithm

2370
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:33,359
called GPA. It's a Berkeley algorithm
 

2371
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,549
called GPA. It's a Berkeley algorithm
and what it does is it actually it does

2372
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:36,559
and what it does is it actually it does
 

2373
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,750
and what it does is it actually it does
like an optimization of prompts and it

2374
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:39,760
like an optimization of prompts and it
 

2375
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,710
like an optimization of prompts and it
actually uses an LM inside the

2376
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:42,720
actually uses an LM inside the
 

2377
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,030
actually uses an LM inside the
optimization. So it asks an LM to

2378
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
optimization. So it asks an LM to
 

2379
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,750
optimization. So it asks an LM to
generate prompts and ask LMS to modify

2380
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:47,760
generate prompts and ask LMS to modify
 

2381
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,069
generate prompts and ask LMS to modify
prompts based on what it observes from

2382
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
prompts based on what it observes from
 

2383
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,710
prompts based on what it observes from
the behaviors of other prompts.

2384
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:52,720
the behaviors of other prompts.
 

2385
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,710
the behaviors of other prompts.
So just keeps running.

2386
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:54,720
So just keeps running.
 

2387
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:00,549
So just keeps running.
So this idea of using an LLM to

2388
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:00,559
So this idea of using an LLM to
 

2389
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,230
So this idea of using an LLM to
uh

2390
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:02,240
uh
 

2391
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,390
uh
reflect on what's happening and suggest

2392
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:04,400
reflect on what's happening and suggest
 

2393
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,670
reflect on what's happening and suggest
a correction. Another group of uh people

2394
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:07,680
a correction. Another group of uh people
 

2395
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,549
a correction. Another group of uh people
you look up text grad

2396
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:10,559
you look up text grad
 

2397
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,710
you look up text grad
text grad means what if your gradient

2398
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:12,720
text grad means what if your gradient
 

2399
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,190
text grad means what if your gradient
was text.

2400
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:15,200
was text.
 

2401
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,790
was text.
So let me back that up. So you think

2402
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:16,800
So let me back that up. So you think
 

2403
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,470
So let me back that up. So you think
about machine learning you think about

2404
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:18,480
about machine learning you think about
 

2405
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,910
about machine learning you think about
you have something you want to make a

2406
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:19,920
you have something you want to make a
 

2407
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,069
you have something you want to make a
change. The direction of change is

2408
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:22,079
change. The direction of change is
 

2409
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,030
change. The direction of change is
gradients are like vectors and then you

2410
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,040
gradients are like vectors and then you
 

2411
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,870
gradients are like vectors and then you
go through and you apply that change

2412
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:26,880
go through and you apply that change
 

2413
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,750
go through and you apply that change
through everything. The idea here was

2414
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:29,760
through everything. The idea here was
 

2415
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,470
through everything. The idea here was
what if your delta

2416
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:32,480
what if your delta
 

2417
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,510
what if your delta
was text like that was pretty good

2418
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:35,520
was text like that was pretty good
 

2419
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,710
was text like that was pretty good
except you should do this.

2420
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:38,720
except you should do this.
 

2421
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,710
except you should do this.
How can you back prop text

2422
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,720
How can you back prop text
 

2423
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,630
How can you back prop text
through a prompt to get a better prompt?

2424
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:46,640
through a prompt to get a better prompt?
 

2425
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,430
through a prompt to get a better prompt?
So textual gradients. So the techniques

2426
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:49,440
So textual gradients. So the techniques
 

2427
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,670
So textual gradients. So the techniques
that are used here are all based are

2428
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:51,680
that are used here are all based are
 

2429
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,670
that are used here are all based are
based on approaches to optimization that

2430
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:53,680
based on approaches to optimization that
 

2431
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,390
based on approaches to optimization that
don't require actual gradients.

2432
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
don't require actual gradients.
 

2433
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,470
don't require actual gradients.
So there's Beijian style optimization

2434
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:58,480
So there's Beijian style optimization
 

2435
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,950
So there's Beijian style optimization
which we don't talk about in this class.

2436
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:00,960
which we don't talk about in this class.
 

2437
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,190
which we don't talk about in this class.
There's also genetic algorithms which is

2438
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:03,200
There's also genetic algorithms which is
 

2439
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,870
There's also genetic algorithms which is
another way of doing optimization that

2440
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:04,880
another way of doing optimization that
 

2441
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,270
another way of doing optimization that
don't require um gradients and it's

2442
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:07,280
don't require um gradients and it's
 

2443
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,030
don't require um gradients and it's
basically exploring the comtorial space

2444
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:09,040
basically exploring the comtorial space
 

2445
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,430
basically exploring the comtorial space
of like prompts in a efficient manner.

2446
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:13,440
of like prompts in a efficient manner.
 

2447
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,589
of like prompts in a efficient manner.
So if you just want to do pure prompting

2448
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:15,599
So if you just want to do pure prompting
 

2449
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,190
So if you just want to do pure prompting
you can do stuff like this. I'm not

2450
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
you can do stuff like this. I'm not
 

2451
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,430
you can do stuff like this. I'm not
going to talk about this anymore.

2452
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:19,440
going to talk about this anymore.
 

2453
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,670
going to talk about this anymore.
Okay. So, and this is not in scope of

2454
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:21,680
Okay. So, and this is not in scope of
 

2455
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,390
Okay. So, and this is not in scope of
the class

2456
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:24,400
the class
 

2457
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,589
the class
because we kind of live in gradient

2458
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:25,599
because we kind of live in gradient
 

2459
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,069
because we kind of live in gradient
land.

2460
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
land.
 

2461
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,870
land.
Okay. So, let's assume we have the

2462
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:30,880
Okay. So, let's assume we have the
 

2463
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,990
Okay. So, let's assume we have the
model. Okay. So, we actually have the

2464
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:34,000
model. Okay. So, we actually have the
 

2465
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,630
model. Okay. So, we actually have the
model.

2466
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:36,640
model.
 

2467
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,990
model.
So, here's my model.

2468
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:40,000
So, here's my model.
 

2469
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,470
So, here's my model.
And the problem is I don't have the

2470
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:42,480
And the problem is I don't have the
 

2471
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,870
And the problem is I don't have the
prompt.

2472
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:44,880
prompt.
 

2473
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,230
prompt.
I want to get a good prompt. Does

2474
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:46,240
I want to get a good prompt. Does
 

2475
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,510
I want to get a good prompt. Does
everyone see like can I see everyone see

2476
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
everyone see like can I see everyone see
 

2477
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,390
everyone see like can I see everyone see
like the picture here what I'm trying to

2478
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:50,400
like the picture here what I'm trying to
 

2479
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:57,109
like the picture here what I'm trying to
do. So

2480
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:57,119

 

2481
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,069

we need this

2482
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:02,079

 

2483
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:13,190

we have only uh this is needed.

2484
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:13,200

 

2485
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,990

How can I do this if I have access to

2486
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:16,000
How can I do this if I have access to
 

2487
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,309
How can I do this if I have access to
the model?

2488
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
the model?
 

2489
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,150
the model?
So,

2490
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,160
So,
 

2491
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,190
So,
anyone have a suggestion?

2492
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:23,200
anyone have a suggestion?
 

2493
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,309
anyone have a suggestion?
Like I know the behavior I want. Okay.

2494
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:26,319
Like I know the behavior I want. Okay.
 

2495
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,069
Like I know the behavior I want. Okay.
So, let me make make it a little bit

2496
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:28,079
So, let me make make it a little bit
 

2497
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,750
So, let me make make it a little bit
clear. So, we're thinking of an example

2498
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:31,760
clear. So, we're thinking of an example
 

2499
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,230
clear. So, we're thinking of an example
where

2500
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,240
where
 

2501
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,109
where
there's something we want to do

2502
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:37,119
there's something we want to do
 

2503
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,910
there's something we want to do
and we have a question and an answer,

2504
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:41,920
and we have a question and an answer,
 

2505
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,990
and we have a question and an answer,
but we need a prompt that's more than

2506
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:44,000
but we need a prompt that's more than
 

2507
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,750
but we need a prompt that's more than
just the question. There's like a

2508
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:45,760
just the question. There's like a
 

2509
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,030
just the question. There's like a
context for the question that we as a

2510
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:49,040
context for the question that we as a
 

2511
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,510
context for the question that we as a
human understand, but the model needs to

2512
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:51,520
human understand, but the model needs to
 

2513
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,670
human understand, but the model needs to
be told what the context is someway.

2514
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:53,680
be told what the context is someway.
 

2515
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,109
be told what the context is someway.
Does everyone see the picture? So in a

2516
00:54:55,109 --> 00:54:55,119
Does everyone see the picture? So in a
 

2517
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,190
Does everyone see the picture? So in a
in a normal

2518
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,200
in a normal
 

2519
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,270
in a normal
handcrafted prompt engineering, it would

2520
00:54:59,270 --> 00:54:59,280
handcrafted prompt engineering, it would
 

2521
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,589
handcrafted prompt engineering, it would
be the kind of text that's like, "You're

2522
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:01,599
be the kind of text that's like, "You're
 

2523
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,990
be the kind of text that's like, "You're
a machine learning expert. It's really

2524
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,000
a machine learning expert. It's really
 

2525
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,829
a machine learning expert. It's really
important that you do this job. I'll be

2526
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:05,839
important that you do this job. I'll be
 

2527
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,589
important that you do this job. I'll be
mad if you don't and if you don't,

2528
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:07,599
mad if you don't and if you don't,

kittens will die." You know, stuff like
this kind of stuff that people do. If

2532
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,280
this kind of stuff that people do. If
 

2533
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,549
this kind of stuff that people do. If
people have seen this kind of stuff that

2534
00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:12,559
people have seen this kind of stuff that
 

2535
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,790
people have seen this kind of stuff that
people post, right? You have like bunch

2536
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:14,800
people post, right? You have like bunch
 

2537
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,190
people post, right? You have like bunch
of text that people write that kind of

2538
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:17,200
of text that people write that kind of
 

2539
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,950
of text that people write that kind of
has some parts that are important in

2540
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
has some parts that are important in
 

2541
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,990
has some parts that are important in
terms and some part that seem weird and

2542
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,000
terms and some part that seem weird and
 

2543
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,150
terms and some part that seem weird and
then after that it says and said then

2544
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:24,160
then after that it says and said then
 

2545
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,150
then after that it says and said then
some more context oh and what I'm trying

2546
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:26,160
some more context oh and what I'm trying
 

2547
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,470
some more context oh and what I'm trying
to work on is all these questions have

2548
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:28,480
to work on is all these questions have
 

2549
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,349
to work on is all these questions have
to do with my database system for which

2550
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:31,359
to do with my database system for which
 

2551
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,150
to do with my database system for which
I need to have a good way of extracting

2552
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:34,160
I need to have a good way of extracting
 

2553
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,990
I need to have a good way of extracting
queries.

2554
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:36,000
queries.
 

2555
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,349
queries.
Okay. Then you say my question is given

2556
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:39,359
Okay. Then you say my question is given
 

2557
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,630
Okay. Then you say my question is given
this table what's the what should I do?

2558
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:42,640
this table what's the what should I do?
 

2559
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,270
this table what's the what should I do?
Okay. So the actual question you have is

2560
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:45,280
Okay. So the actual question you have is
 

2561
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,349
Okay. So the actual question you have is
the given this table what should I do

2562
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:47,359
the given this table what should I do
 

2563
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,069
the given this table what should I do
kind of question.

2564
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:50,079
kind of question.
 

2565
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,069
kind of question.
Suppose you have answers for many of

2566
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
Suppose you have answers for many of
 

2567
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,349
Suppose you have answers for many of
these kinds of questions. It comes up

2568
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:53,359
these kinds of questions. It comes up
 

2569
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,789
these kinds of questions. It comes up
many times. But it's that other text.

2570
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:56,799
many times. But it's that other text.
 

2571
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,230
many times. But it's that other text.
Okay. So I'm going to take this needed

2572
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
Okay. So I'm going to take this needed
 

2573
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,589
Okay. So I'm going to take this needed
text. I'm going to divide it into two

2574
00:55:59,589 --> 00:55:59,599
text. I'm going to divide it into two
 

2575
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,190
text. I'm going to divide it into two
two parts.

2576
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:03,200

 

2577
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,589

Let me erase this.

2578
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:07,599

 

2579
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,349

Let's make it two parts.

2580
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:11,359
Let's make it two parts.
 

2581
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:16,950
Let's make it two parts.
I need a pre-prompt

2582
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:16,960

 

2583
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,309

and then I have

2584
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:20,319
and then I have
 

2585
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,069
and then I have
question.

2586
00:56:24,069 --> 00:56:24,079

 

2587
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,549

This question requires context.

2588
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:26,559
This question requires context.
 

2589
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,150
This question requires context.
So I'm trying to get this pre-prompt.

2590
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:28,160
So I'm trying to get this pre-prompt.
 

2591
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,910
So I'm trying to get this pre-prompt.
That's the thing I want to optimize.

2592
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:31,920

 

2593
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,470

Is it clear we're trying to do? Okay.

2594
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
Is it clear we're trying to do? Okay.
 

2595
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,309
Is it clear we're trying to do? Okay.
So now

2596
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:40,319

 

2597
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,390

let's think

2598
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:42,400
let's think
 

2599
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,069
let's think
we have data we have lots of question

2600
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,079
we have data we have lots of question
 

2601
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,150
we have data we have lots of question
response pairs that are correct suppose

2602
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:48,160
response pairs that are correct suppose
 

2603
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,589
response pairs that are correct suppose
we have this so we have examples

2604
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:51,599
we have this so we have examples
 

2605
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,589
we have this so we have examples
I want to get what goes here what can I

2606
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:55,599
I want to get what goes here what can I
 

2607
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:07,430
I want to get what goes here what can I
Anyone

2608
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:07,440

 

2609
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,270

have an idea?

2610
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:11,280

 

2611
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:11,910

>> Yeah.

2612
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:11,920
>> Yeah.
 

2613
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,030
>> Yeah.
>> Question about the question.

2614
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,040
>> Question about the question.
 

2615
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,349
>> Question about the question.
>> Sure.

2616
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:13,359
>> Sure.
 

2617
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,109
>> Sure.
>> So we're saying are we saying that we

2618
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
>> So we're saying are we saying that we
 

2619
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,829
>> So we're saying are we saying that we
want a model to give us that?

2620
00:57:17,829 --> 00:57:17,839
want a model to give us that?
 

2621
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:21,510
want a model to give us that?
>> Oh, great. So let me the model we have

2622
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:21,520
>> Oh, great. So let me the model we have
 

2623
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,230
>> Oh, great. So let me the model we have
is uh let's say llama 33. Okay. So we

2624
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:26,240
is uh let's say llama 33. Okay. So we
 

2625
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,789
is uh let's say llama 33. Okay. So we
have it a specific model.

2626
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:28,799
have it a specific model.
 

2627
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,030
have it a specific model.
We think the model is quite capable. The

2628
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,040
We think the model is quite capable. The
 

2629
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,309
We think the model is quite capable. The
model however if we just give it our

2630
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:34,319
model however if we just give it our
 

2631
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,510
model however if we just give it our
question how do I make a query for this

2632
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:37,520
question how do I make a query for this
 

2633
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,109
question how do I make a query for this
particular table that extracts blah it

2634
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:41,119
particular table that extracts blah it
 

2635
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,349
particular table that extracts blah it
does a bad job. It doesn't actually give

2636
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:43,359
does a bad job. It doesn't actually give
 

2637
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,589
does a bad job. It doesn't actually give
me good answers.

2638
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:45,599
me good answers.
 

2639
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,829
me good answers.
And

2640
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:47,839
And
 

2641
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:53,190
And
so I could try to just do a fine tune of

2642
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:53,200
so I could try to just do a fine tune of
 

2643
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,190
so I could try to just do a fine tune of
llama 33

2644
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:55,200
llama 33
 

2645
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,789
llama 33
train all the weights to get better at

2646
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:56,799
train all the weights to get better at
 

2647
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,349
train all the weights to get better at
these question answer pairs. However, I

2648
00:57:59,349 --> 00:57:59,359
these question answer pairs. However, I
 

2649
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,069
these question answer pairs. However, I
don't want to do that. I want to only

2650
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:02,079
don't want to do that. I want to only
 

2651
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,470
don't want to do that. I want to only
get a better prompt.

2652
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:06,480

 

2653
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,910

Okay. So if I had these question answer

2654
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:09,920
Okay. So if I had these question answer
 

2655
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,069
Okay. So if I had these question answer
pairs, I could do a full fine tune. So

2656
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:12,079
pairs, I could do a full fine tune. So
 

2657
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,670
pairs, I could do a full fine tune. So
let's assume that I do that and it

2658
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,680
let's assume that I do that and it
 

2659
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,150
let's assume that I do that and it
works. So I know it's possible to

2660
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,160
works. So I know it's possible to
 

2661
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,589
works. So I know it's possible to
fine-tune this model except I can't

2662
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:17,599
fine-tune this model except I can't
 

2663
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,230
fine-tune this model except I can't
afford to do it

2664
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:20,240
afford to do it
 

2665
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,470
afford to do it
or I actually although I can run llama

2666
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:24,480
or I actually although I can run llama
 

2667
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,069
or I actually although I can run llama
33 and fine-tune it I don't have the

2668
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:28,079
33 and fine-tune it I don't have the
 

2669
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,109
33 and fine-tune it I don't have the
capability of hosting full inference of

2670
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:31,119
capability of hosting full inference of
 

2671
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,109
capability of hosting full inference of
this thing at scale of my of my custom

2672
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:33,119
this thing at scale of my of my custom
 

2673
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,349
this thing at scale of my of my custom
model. So what I want to do is I want to

2674
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:35,359
model. So what I want to do is I want to
 

2675
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:38,950
model. So what I want to do is I want to
use somebody else's llama 33 inference

2676
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:38,960
use somebody else's llama 33 inference
 

2677
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,910
use somebody else's llama 33 inference
and just shoot stuff into it and get the

2678
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:41,920
and just shoot stuff into it and get the
 

2679
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,870
and just shoot stuff into it and get the
answers. Everyone see kind of I'm only

2680
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:44,880
answers. Everyone see kind of I'm only
 

2681
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,349
answers. Everyone see kind of I'm only
trying to get a better prompt.

2682
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:49,359

 

2683
00:58:49,359 --> 00:59:01,349

>> Yeah.

2684
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:01,359

 

2685
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,430

>> Very good. So the idea is we want to do

2686
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:03,440
>> Very good. So the idea is we want to do
 

2687
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,430
>> Very good. So the idea is we want to do
something like a fine-tuning run except

2688
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:05,440
something like a fine-tuning run except
 

2689
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,030
something like a fine-tuning run except
we want to do a fine tuning run on the

2690
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:07,040
we want to do a fine tuning run on the
 

2691
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,030
we want to do a fine tuning run on the
pre-prompt. We don't want to change the

2692
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:09,040
pre-prompt. We don't want to change the
 

2693
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,670
pre-prompt. We don't want to change the
weights inside the model. The question

2694
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
weights inside the model. The question
 

2695
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,470
weights inside the model. The question
is how can we do that or what's the

2696
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:14,480
is how can we do that or what's the
 

2697
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,309
is how can we do that or what's the
challenge we have and how do we resolve

2698
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:16,319
challenge we have and how do we resolve
 

2699
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,549
challenge we have and how do we resolve
that challenge? That's the question.

2700
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:18,559
that challenge? That's the question.
 

2701
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,430
that challenge? That's the question.
Okay, so I want to freeze the entire

2702
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:21,440
Okay, so I want to freeze the entire
 

2703
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,510
Okay, so I want to freeze the entire
model. I want to change only here. What

2704
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:25,520
model. I want to change only here. What
 

2705
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,990
model. I want to change only here. What
can I do? And what what's what's my

2706
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:28,000
can I do? And what what's what's my
 

2707
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,069
can I do? And what what's what's my
obstacle?

2708
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
obstacle?
 

2709
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,829
obstacle?
>> Yeah.

2710
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:31,839
>> Yeah.
 

2711
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:35,109
>> Yeah.
versus

2712
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:35,119

 

2713
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,069

>> yeah the problem is so if I do this I

2714
00:59:38,069 --> 00:59:38,079
>> yeah the problem is so if I do this I
 

2715
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,789
>> yeah the problem is so if I do this I
can definitely get gradients right I can

2716
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:40,799
can definitely get gradients right I can
 

2717
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,030
can definitely get gradients right I can
have gradients flowing you know from

2718
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:43,040
have gradients flowing you know from
 

2719
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,750
have gradients flowing you know from
oops I don't want to do that

2720
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:45,760
oops I don't want to do that
 

2721
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,069
oops I don't want to do that
I can get gradients flowing you know

2722
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:48,079
I can get gradients flowing you know
 

2723
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,789
I can get gradients flowing you know
from all these places

2724
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:50,799
from all these places
 

2725
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:54,309
from all these places
down into this pre-prompt but the

2726
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:54,319
down into this pre-prompt but the
 

2727
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:58,309
down into this pre-prompt but the
problem is the gradients can't cross

2728
00:59:58,309 --> 00:59:58,319
problem is the gradients can't cross
 

2729
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,950
problem is the gradients can't cross
the embed properly

2730
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:00,960
the embed properly
 

2731
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,870
the embed properly
because this thing is discrete on this

2732
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:02,880
because this thing is discrete on this
 

2733
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,589
because this thing is discrete on this
side. So I can't change it a little bit.

2734
01:00:05,589 --> 01:00:05,599
side. So I can't change it a little bit.
 

2735
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:08,069
side. So I can't change it a little bit.
Does everyone see this issue? So if I

2736
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:08,079
Does everyone see this issue? So if I
 

2737
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,190
Does everyone see this issue? So if I
want to do

2738
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:11,200
want to do
 

2739
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:17,030
want to do
this problem, but I can't.

2740
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,040

 

2741
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,230

Okay. I want to make sure everyone's

2742
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:18,240
Okay. I want to make sure everyone's
 

2743
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,150
Okay. I want to make sure everyone's
everyone's clear on the challenge. Ask

2744
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:20,160
everyone's clear on the challenge. Ask
 

2745
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,190
everyone's clear on the challenge. Ask
me a question if you don't understand

2746
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:21,200
me a question if you don't understand
 

2747
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,349
me a question if you don't understand
the challenge here

2748
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:23,359
the challenge here
 

2749
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,349
the challenge here
or the basic approach. I want to do it

2750
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:25,359
or the basic approach. I want to do it
 

2751
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,829
or the basic approach. I want to do it
using gradients. Yeah. Question. I was

2752
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:29,839
using gradients. Yeah. Question. I was
 

2753
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:40,549
using gradients. Yeah. Question. I was
see.

2754
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559

 

2755
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,190

>> Sure. So what you're describing of

2756
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:43,200
>> Sure. So what you're describing of
 

2757
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,190
>> Sure. So what you're describing of
seeing what it does, you pick a prompt.

2758
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,200
seeing what it does, you pick a prompt.
 

2759
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,710
seeing what it does, you pick a prompt.
So you start with a human engineered

2760
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:46,720
So you start with a human engineered
 

2761
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,950
So you start with a human engineered
prompt, then you run it and then you

2762
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:48,960
prompt, then you run it and then you
 

2763
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,589
prompt, then you run it and then you
human reflect and you see what did it

2764
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:51,599
human reflect and you see what did it
 

2765
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,829
human reflect and you see what did it
get wrong and then you human change the

2766
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:53,839
get wrong and then you human change the
 

2767
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,789
get wrong and then you human change the
prompt. That's what people did.

2768
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:56,799
prompt. That's what people did.
 

2769
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:01,750
prompt. That's what people did.
Okay. And but it's annoying. And second,

2770
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:01,760
Okay. And but it's annoying. And second,
 

2771
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,109
Okay. And but it's annoying. And second,
it's not very scalable. And third,

2772
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:05,119
it's not very scalable. And third,
 

2773
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,710
it's not very scalable. And third,
humans aren't necessarily that good at

2774
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:06,720
humans aren't necessarily that good at
 

2775
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,549
humans aren't necessarily that good at
it.

2776
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:08,559
it.
 

2777
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,950
it.
So, DSPY is a way of automating that

2778
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:12,960
So, DSPY is a way of automating that
 

2779
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,710
So, DSPY is a way of automating that
particular process. And this textual

2780
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:14,720
particular process. And this textual
 

2781
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,710
particular process. And this textual
gradients and other ideas are a way of

2782
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:16,720
gradients and other ideas are a way of
 

2783
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,230
gradients and other ideas are a way of
trying to do that. What I'm trying to do

2784
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,240
trying to do that. What I'm trying to do
 

2785
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,910
trying to do that. What I'm trying to do
is I'm trying to use good oldfashioned

2786
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:19,920
is I'm trying to use good oldfashioned
 

2787
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,870
is I'm trying to use good oldfashioned
gradients to solve the problem, not this

2788
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:22,880
gradients to solve the problem, not this
 

2789
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,109
gradients to solve the problem, not this
kind of textual reflection.

2790
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:25,119
kind of textual reflection.
 

2791
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,950
kind of textual reflection.
>> Yeah.

2792
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:26,960
>> Yeah.
 

2793
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:37,910
>> Yeah.
from the question.

2794
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:37,920

 

2795
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,829

>> I'm not following. So I have this I want

2797
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,230

01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:42,240
to get this pre-prompt. So you're saying
 

2799
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,510
to get this pre-prompt. So you're saying
I could ask the model to say I have

2800
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:45,520
I could ask the model to say I have
 

2801
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,510
I could ask the model to say I have
these questions and these answers. Give

2802
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:47,520
these questions and these answers. Give
 

2803
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,109
these questions and these answers. Give
me a prompt that will give me those

01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:49,119
me a prompt that will give me those
 

2805
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,309
me a prompt that will give me those
questions and answers.

2806
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:50,319
questions and answers.
 

2807
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,069
questions and answers.
>> Based on your question, there's some

2812
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:58,559

 

2813
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,270

So the model is just this stack of

2814
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,280
So the model is just this stack of
 

2815
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,390
So the model is just this stack of
embedded transformer layers dime and so

2816
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:04,400
embedded transformer layers dime and so
 

2817
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,150
embedded transformer layers dime and so
on.

2818
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:06,160
on.
 

2819
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,589
on.
Okay. So this is not the output of

2820
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:09,599
Okay. So this is not the output of
 

2821
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,589
Okay. So this is not the output of
anything.

2822
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:11,599
anything.
 

2823
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,030
anything.
The only way to make it the output of

2824
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:13,040
The only way to make it the output of
 

2825
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,910
The only way to make it the output of
anything is to ask this model a question

2826
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:15,920
anything is to ask this model a question
 

2827
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,829
anything is to ask this model a question
that involves this as an output. But

2828
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:17,839
that involves this as an output. But
 

2829
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,430
that involves this as an output. But
this is not an output.

2830

2831
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,270

So you can't So

2832
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:25,280
So you can't So
 

2833
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,549
So you can't So
all of these approaches that you're

2834
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:26,559
all of these approaches that you're
 

2835
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,309
all of these approaches that you're
describing are all in the style of

2836
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:28,319
describing are all in the style of
 

2837
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,829
describing are all in the style of
things that are done systematically by

01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:29,839
things that are done systematically by
 

2839
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,910
things that are done systematically by
things like DSPY.

2840
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:31,920
things like DSPY.
 

2841
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,390
things like DSPY.
Okay. Using Beijian optimization,

2842
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:34,400
Okay. Using Beijian optimization,
 

2843
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,109
Okay. Using Beijian optimization,
genetic algorithms and other approaches,

2844
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:37,119
genetic algorithms and other approaches,
 

2845
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,390
genetic algorithms and other approaches,
you know, textual gradient like

2846
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,400
you know, textual gradient like
 

2847
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,349
you know, textual gradient like
thinking. So I want to use this straight

2848
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:41,359
thinking. So I want to use this straight
 

2849
01:02:41,359 --> 01:03:08,630
thinking. So I want to use this straight
up regular gradients. Yeah.

2850
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:08,640

 

2851
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,470

Excellent. Okay, that's what we're going

2852
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:10,480
Excellent. Okay, that's what we're going
 

2853
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,150
Excellent. Okay, that's what we're going
to do. So here's a way of thinking about

2854
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:12,160
to do. So here's a way of thinking about
 

2855
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,230
to do. So here's a way of thinking about
it um in a way that you can generalize

2856
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:16,240
it um in a way that you can generalize
 

2857
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,950
it um in a way that you can generalize
thinking. It says I would like to have

2858
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:18,960
thinking. It says I would like to have
 

2859
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,829
thinking. It says I would like to have
gradients go back to the pre-prompt.

2860
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:23,839
gradients go back to the pre-prompt.
 

2861
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:28,230
gradients go back to the pre-prompt.
However, they get stopped here.

2862
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,240
However, they get stopped here.
 

2863
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:35,430
However, they get stopped here.
I can't go back. So fine, stop here.

2864
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:35,440

 

2865
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,990

Say, okay, can't do this.

2866
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:40,000
Say, okay, can't do this.
 

2867
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,990
Say, okay, can't do this.
just

2868
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:46,000

 

2869
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,069

have a soft prompt

2870
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:50,079

 

2871
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:52,150

that just consists of the embeddings. So

2872
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,160
that just consists of the embeddings. So
 

2873
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,710
that just consists of the embeddings. So
I take the initial human prompt, I get

2874
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:54,720
I take the initial human prompt, I get
 

2875
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,750
I take the initial human prompt, I get
embeddings for it. I call those all

2876
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:57,760
embeddings for it. I call those all
 

2877
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,630
embeddings for it. I call those all
special tokens.

2878
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:00,640
special tokens.
 

2879
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,150
special tokens.
Okay, these are special tokens. I'm

2880
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:02,160
Okay, these are special tokens. I'm
 

2881
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,630
Okay, these are special tokens. I'm
adding to my token table. I initialize

2882
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:04,640
adding to my token table. I initialize
 

2883
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,069
adding to my token table. I initialize
them as copies of the embeddings that

2884
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:08,079
them as copies of the embeddings that
 

2885
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,150
them as copies of the embeddings that
they used to have.

2886
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:10,160
they used to have.
 

2887
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,789
they used to have.
But then I let gradients fall into the

2888
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:12,799
But then I let gradients fall into the
 

2889
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,349
But then I let gradients fall into the
embeder in those special tokens. This

2890
01:04:15,349 --> 01:04:15,359
embeder in those special tokens. This
 

2891
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,430
embeder in those special tokens. This
gets frozen into special one, special

2892
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:17,440
gets frozen into special one, special
 

2893
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,710
gets frozen into special one, special
two, special three, special four,

2894
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
two, special three, special four,
 

2895
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,589
two, special three, special four,
special five, special six, special so on

2896
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:21,599
special five, special six, special so on
 

2897
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:22,870
special five, special six, special so on
just specials, a whole bunch of

2898
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:22,880
just specials, a whole bunch of
 

2899
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,390
just specials, a whole bunch of
specials.

2900
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:24,400
specials.
 

2901
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,670
specials.
So if I'm going to optimize something

2902
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:25,680
So if I'm going to optimize something
 

2903
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,910
So if I'm going to optimize something
that's 100 long, I have 100 specials

2904
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:29,920
that's 100 long, I have 100 specials
 

2905
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,750
that's 100 long, I have 100 specials
and I have gradients falling into the

2906
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:31,760
and I have gradients falling into the
 

2907
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,109
and I have gradients falling into the
embedding table only. Okay, now does

2908
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:35,119
embedding table only. Okay, now does
 

2909
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,990
embedding table only. Okay, now does
everyone see that idea? the gradients

2910
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:38,000
everyone see that idea? the gradients
 

2911
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,789
everyone see that idea? the gradients
can can go to the embedder.

2912
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:40,799
can can go to the embedder.
 

2913
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,630
can can go to the embedder.
I've added these special things and now

2914
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:42,640
I've added these special things and now
 

2915
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,430
I've added these special things and now
they will move continuously.

2916
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:45,440
they will move continuously.
 

2917
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,589
they will move continuously.
This is called a soft prompt because it

2918
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:47,599
This is called a soft prompt because it
 

2919
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,390
This is called a soft prompt because it
can move continuously. It's soft and not

2920
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:50,400
can move continuously. It's soft and not
 

2921
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,470
can move continuously. It's soft and not
hard in terms of discrete.

2922
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
hard in terms of discrete.
 

2923
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,990
hard in terms of discrete.
Also, it's called a continuous prompt

2924
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,000
Also, it's called a continuous prompt
 

2925
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,309
Also, it's called a continuous prompt
but soft prompt is the standard term.

2926
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:58,319
but soft prompt is the standard term.
 

2927
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,910
but soft prompt is the standard term.
Now you were suggesting something that

2928
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920
Now you were suggesting something that
 

2929
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,829
Now you were suggesting something that
goes beyond that which is also done

2930
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:01,839
goes beyond that which is also done
 

2931
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,630
goes beyond that which is also done
which says after I have optimized my

2932
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:04,640
which says after I have optimized my
 

2933
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,589
which says after I have optimized my
soft prompt for a while. I can choose to

2934
01:05:07,589 --> 01:05:07,599
soft prompt for a while. I can choose to
 

2935
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,309
soft prompt for a while. I can choose to
quantize it back to discrete tokens

2936
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:12,319
quantize it back to discrete tokens
 

2937
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,309
quantize it back to discrete tokens
to say what is this what is the actual

2938
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:14,319
to say what is this what is the actual
 

2939
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,190
to say what is this what is the actual
discrete token in my actual embed that's

2940
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:17,200
discrete token in my actual embed that's
 

2941
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,589
discrete token in my actual embed that's
closest to this one. take some of them

2942
01:05:19,589 --> 01:05:19,599
closest to this one. take some of them
 

2943
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:21,750
closest to this one. take some of them
and quantize them back down to that and

2944
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:21,760
and quantize them back down to that and
 

2945
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,510
and quantize them back down to that and
then continue to do gradient steps on

2946
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:23,520
then continue to do gradient steps on
 

2947
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,589
then continue to do gradient steps on
the rest to adjust to the things I just

2948
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:25,599
the rest to adjust to the things I just
 

2949
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:28,789
the rest to adjust to the things I just
froze and again project them and keep

2950
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
froze and again project them and keep
 

2951
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,630
froze and again project them and keep
doing this until finally I projected all

2952
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:30,640
doing this until finally I projected all
 

2953
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,470
doing this until finally I projected all
of them down and now I have a frozen

2954
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:32,480
of them down and now I have a frozen
 

2955
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,910
of them down and now I have a frozen
prompt that's actually

2956
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:35,920
prompt that's actually
 

2957
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,230
prompt that's actually
in token language it won't be human

2958
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:38,240
in token language it won't be human
 

2959
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,870
in token language it won't be human
interpretable it'll be weird

2960
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:40,880
interpretable it'll be weird
 

2961
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,510
interpretable it'll be weird
but it may might have the same effect

2962
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
but it may might have the same effect
 

2963
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,309
but it may might have the same effect
this is done okay but I'm just going to

2964
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:46,319
this is done okay but I'm just going to
 

2965
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,549
this is done okay but I'm just going to
stop at the soft prompting I'm totally

2966
01:05:48,549 --> 01:05:48,559
stop at the soft prompting I'm totally
 

2967
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,470
stop at the soft prompting I'm totally
happy. So I'm going to say if my API

2968
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:50,480
happy. So I'm going to say if my API
 

2969
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,270
happy. So I'm going to say if my API
lets me inject not just tokens but

2970
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:53,280
lets me inject not just tokens but
 

2971
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,390
lets me inject not just tokens but
actual embeddings in

2972
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,400
actual embeddings in
 

2973
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,789
actual embeddings in
then I can just prompt it with a

2974
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:58,799
then I can just prompt it with a
 

2975
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:01,589
then I can just prompt it with a
continuous embedding sequence.

2976
01:06:01,589 --> 01:06:01,599
continuous embedding sequence.
 

2977
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:09,670
continuous embedding sequence.
Yeah. Question.

2978
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:09,680

 

2979
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,190

So there

2980
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:13,200

 

2981
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,710

>> that's a very good question and in fact

2982
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:16,720
>> that's a very good question and in fact
 

2983
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,190
>> that's a very good question and in fact
this approach is restricted to having a

01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:19,200
this approach is restricted to having a
 

2985
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,109
this approach is restricted to having a
fixed length of these prompts. So my

2986
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:23,119
fixed length of these prompts. So my
 

2987
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,470
fixed length of these prompts. So my
pre-prompt is fixed length. My question

2988
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:26,480
pre-prompt is fixed length. My question
 

2989
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,870
pre-prompt is fixed length. My question
can be variable length.

2990
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:28,880
can be variable length.
 

2991
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,549
can be variable length.
This is a human readable question that

2992
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:30,559
This is a human readable question that
 

2993
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,190
This is a human readable question that
is coming in. But this is fixed and it's

2994
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:33,200
is coming in. But this is fixed and it's
 

2995
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,510
is coming in. But this is fixed and it's
just trying to get it to do the task I

2996
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:35,520
just trying to get it to do the task I
 

2997
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,990
just trying to get it to do the task I
want. If I want to play with that

2998
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,000
want. If I want to play with that
 

2999
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,430
want. If I want to play with that
length, I can just treat that as a

3000
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:39,440
length, I can just treat that as a
 

3001
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,270
length, I can just treat that as a
hyperparameter that I have to sweep over

3002
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:41,280
hyperparameter that I have to sweep over
 

3003
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,910
hyperparameter that I have to sweep over
and train. So people have played with

3004
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:43,920
and train. So people have played with
 

3005
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,349
and train. So people have played with
this soft. So everyone understand the

3006
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:45,359
this soft. So everyone understand the
 

3007
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:49,990
this soft. So everyone understand the
key idea of soft prompting. No. Okay. So

3008
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:50,000
key idea of soft prompting. No. Okay. So
 

3009
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,910
key idea of soft prompting. No. Okay. So

3040
01:07:59,270 --> 01:07:59,280

01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520

 

3043
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,230

added

3044
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,240

3045
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,950
added
for

3046
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:10,960
for
 

3047
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,109
for
these guys.

3048
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
these guys.
 

3049
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,029
these guys.
So explicitly I'm saying I'm going to

3050
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:15,039
So explicitly I'm saying I'm going to
 

3051
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,870
So explicitly I'm saying I'm going to
introduce new tokens. They did not exist

3052
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
introduce new tokens. They did not exist
 

3053
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,590
introduce new tokens. They did not exist
in pre-training. They're new tokens.

3054
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:19,600
in pre-training. They're new tokens.
 

3055
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,630
in pre-training. They're new tokens.
They have to be represented in the

3056
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:20,640
They have to be represented in the
 

3057
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,870
They have to be represented in the
embedder. So I add 100 new columns for

3058
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:22,880
embedder. So I add 100 new columns for
 

3059
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,590
embedder. So I add 100 new columns for
them. I initialize those 100 columns

3060
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:25,600
them. I initialize those 100 columns
 

3061
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,550
them. I initialize those 100 columns
somehow. For example, I initialize them

3062
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:28,560
somehow. For example, I initialize them
 

3063
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,870
somehow. For example, I initialize them
with a human engineered prompt. I copy

3064
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:30,880
with a human engineered prompt. I copy
 

3065
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,630
with a human engineered prompt. I copy
the embedding of the human engineered

3066
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:32,640
the embedding of the human engineered
 

3067
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,269
the embedding of the human engineered
prompt pre-prompt and I drop them in.

3068
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:35,279
prompt pre-prompt and I drop them in.
 

3069
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:54,070
prompt pre-prompt and I drop them in.
But these are now learnable parameters.

3070
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:54,080

 

3071
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,550

>> So they're just like the mask tokens

tokens.

3074
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:58,000
tokens.
 

3075
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,430
tokens.
They're just like the start token or a

3076
01:08:59,430 --> 01:08:59,440
They're just like the start token or a
 

3077
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,829
They're just like the start token or a
mask token. Yeah, they're special.

3078
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:01,839
mask token. Yeah, they're special.
 

3079
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:05,510
mask token. Yeah, they're special.
They're like any token. Okay. Um so

3080
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:05,520
They're like any token. Okay. Um so
 

3081
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,590
They're like any token. Okay. Um so
they're learnable parameters. Everything

3082
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:07,600
they're learnable parameters. Everything
 

3083
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,149
they're learnable parameters. Everything
else in the model is frozen.

3084
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:10,159
else in the model is frozen.
 

3085
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:12,229
else in the model is frozen.
So gradients are flowing to everything,

3086
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:12,239
So gradients are flowing to everything,
 

3087
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:13,430
So gradients are flowing to everything,
but these are the only ones that are

3088
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:13,440
but these are the only ones that are
 

3089
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,829
but these are the only ones that are
learnable. What does that mean? The only

3090
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:15,839
learnable. What does that mean? The only
 

3091
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,390
learnable. What does that mean? The only
thing I'm tracking in optimizer state is

3092
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:18,400
thing I'm tracking in optimizer state is
 

3093
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,630
thing I'm tracking in optimizer state is
these guys. So I have momentum for these

3094
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:20,640
these guys. So I have momentum for these
 

3095
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,550
these guys. So I have momentum for these
guys. I have magnitude squares for these

3096
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:22,560
guys. I have magnitude squares for these
 

3097
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,390
guys. I have magnitude squares for these
guys. I track these hundred parameters.

3098
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
guys. I track these hundred parameters.
 

3099
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,749
guys. I track these hundred parameters.
Everything else is frozen. I don't do

3100
01:09:27,749 --> 01:09:27,759
Everything else is frozen. I don't do
 

3101
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:29,110
Everything else is frozen. I don't do
any updates to them. I only update

any updates to them. I only update
 

3103
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,390
any updates to them. I only update
these.

3113

think of them as there's hundred special

think of them as there's hundred special
 

3115

ones and they're weight shared across
 

3117
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,910

all of these embedders, but they're

every position has its own. So in that

3124

every position has its own. So in that
 

3125
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,470

01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,990
good question. So the question is why am
I doing this? I'm doing this because all

3172
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:58,000
I doing this? I'm doing this because all
 

3173
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,229
I doing this? I'm doing this because all
fine-tunes

3174
01:11:00,229 --> 01:11:00,239
fine-tunes
 

3175
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,110
fine-tunes
are only done in the setting where

3176
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:03,120
are only done in the setting where
 

3177
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,950
are only done in the setting where
there's a task that I want to do many

3178
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:04,960
there's a task that I want to do many
 

3179
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,950
there's a task that I want to do many
many times and I would like to have a

3180
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:06,960
many times and I would like to have a
 

3181
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,709
many times and I would like to have a
model that can do that task many many

3182
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:08,719
model that can do that task many many
 

3183
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,550
model that can do that task many many
times. If I have a task I want to do

3184
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:10,560
times. If I have a task I want to do
 

3185
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,390
times. If I have a task I want to do
once that's not a fine-tuning problem

3186
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,400
once that's not a fine-tuning problem
 

3187
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,189
once that's not a fine-tuning problem
typically. So there's a particular kinds

3188
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:17,199
typically. So there's a particular kinds
 

3189
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:18,709
typically. So there's a particular kinds
of question I need to ask many many

3190
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:18,719
of question I need to ask many many
 

3191
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,229
of question I need to ask many many
times. So for that I would like to have

3192
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:22,239
times. So for that I would like to have
 

3193
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,229
times. So for that I would like to have
a prompt that will let me do this many

3194
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:24,239
a prompt that will let me do this many
 

3195
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:25,510
a prompt that will let me do this many
many times. In particular I'd like to

3196
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:25,520
many times. In particular I'd like to
 

3197
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,189
many times. In particular I'd like to
have a pre-prompt that lets me ask many

3198
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:27,199
have a pre-prompt that lets me ask many
 

3199
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,149
have a pre-prompt that lets me ask many
questions of this kind of genre

3200
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:30,159
questions of this kind of genre

JSON but the that's an example. there's
 

3219
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,470
JSON but the that's an example. there's
a specific format. You want to be able

3220
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:48,480
a specific format. You want to be able
 

3221
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,950
a specific format. You want to be able
to get it to do that format. You would

3222
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:50,960
to get it to do that format. You would
 

3223
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,470
to get it to do that format. You would
like to have a model that's very good at

01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,480
like to have a model that's very good at
 

3225
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,270
like to have a model that's very good at
that format. And so you can't afford to

3226
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:55,280
that format. And so you can't afford to
 

3227
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,270
that format. And so you can't afford to
make an entire model, but maybe you can

3228
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:57,280
make an entire model, but maybe you can
 

3229
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,030
make an entire model, but maybe you can
find a good way of prompting it. And

3230
01:11:59,030 --> 01:11:59,040
find a good way of prompting it. And
 

3231
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,669
find a good way of prompting it. And
this is a soft prompt approach of doing

3232
01:12:01,669 --> 01:12:01,679
this is a soft prompt approach of doing
 

3233
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,350
this is a soft prompt approach of doing
it. Yeah.

3234
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:03,360
it. Yeah.
 

3235
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,750
it. Yeah.
>> Transfer across models if

3237
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,270

01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:07,280
>> Yeah, great question. Do soft prompts
 

3239
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,030

3241
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,990

They do not transfer across models. So

3242
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:12,000
They do not transfer across models. So
 

3243
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,990
They do not transfer across models. So
basic answer they can sometimes transfer

3244
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:14,000
basic answer they can sometimes transfer
 

3245
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,510
basic answer they can sometimes transfer
a little bit across model variants that

3246
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:15,520
a little bit across model variants that
 

3247
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,070
a little bit across model variants that
are both fine-tunes of the same thing

3248
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:18,080
are both fine-tunes of the same thing
 

3249
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,910
are both fine-tunes of the same thing
but they generally are restricted. In

3250
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:19,920
but they generally are restricted. In
 

3251
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,430
but they generally are restricted. In
fact even if you quantize them to

3252
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:21,440
fact even if you quantize them to
 

3253
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,510
fact even if you quantize them to
something they won't transfer. The

3254
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:23,520
something they won't transfer. The
 

3255
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,270
something they won't transfer. The
amazing thing about DSPY and those

3256
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:25,280
amazing thing about DSPY and those
 

3257
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,709
amazing thing about DSPY and those
prompts is that sometimes those do

3258
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:26,719
prompts is that sometimes those do
 

3259
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,030
prompts is that sometimes those do
transfer across models.

3260
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:29,040
transfer across models.
 

3261
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,790
transfer across models.
Um

3262
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:30,800
Um
 

3263
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,270
Um
yeah okay so everyone's good with this?

3264
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
yeah okay so everyone's good with this?
 

3265
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,669
yeah okay so everyone's good with this?
So now,

3266
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
So now,
 

3267
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,470
So now,
amazingly, people saw that when you did

3268
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:40,480
amazingly, people saw that when you did
 

3269
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,550
amazingly, people saw that when you did
this, they worked. I'll skip ahead.

3270
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:42,560
this, they worked. I'll skip ahead.
 

3271
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,229
this, they worked. I'll skip ahead.
Okay,

3272
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:44,239
Okay,
 

3273
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,310
Okay,
so there's another another version of

3274
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,320
so there's another another version of
 

3275
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,790
so there's another another version of
it. It's called prefix soft prefixes.

3276
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:48,800
it. It's called prefix soft prefixes.
 

3277
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,430
it. It's called prefix soft prefixes.
I'll explain that in a moment. Um, but

3278
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:51,440
I'll explain that in a moment. Um, but
 

3279
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,830
I'll explain that in a moment. Um, but
the amazing thing is they have far far

3280
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:53,840
the amazing thing is they have far far
 

3281
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,229
the amazing thing is they have far far
far fewer parameters in the entire

3282
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:56,239
far fewer parameters in the entire
 

3283
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,390
far fewer parameters in the entire
model. So here's an example. Suppose I

3284
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:58,400
model. So here's an example. Suppose I
 

3285
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,270
model. So here's an example. Suppose I
have an 8 billion parameter llama model,

3286
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:01,280
have an 8 billion parameter llama model,
 

3287
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,790
have an 8 billion parameter llama model,
okay?

3288
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:02,800
okay?
 

3289
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,070
okay?
and my embedding is length 4,96

3290
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:06,080
and my embedding is length 4,96
 

3291
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:10,229
and my embedding is length 4,96
and I choose a pre-prompt length of 100.

3292
01:13:10,229 --> 01:13:10,239
and I choose a pre-prompt length of 100.
 

3293
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:11,830
and I choose a pre-prompt length of 100.
How many parameters in this embedding do

3294
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:11,840
How many parameters in this embedding do
 

3295
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,070
How many parameters in this embedding do
I have to learn? Well, 4,96 times 100,

3296
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:14,080
I have to learn? Well, 4,96 times 100,
 

3297
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,790
I have to learn? Well, 4,96 times 100,
40,000 parameters. So, I just have to

3298
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:16,800
40,000 parameters. So, I just have to
 

3299
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,149
40,000 parameters. So, I just have to
tune 40,000 parameters

3300
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:20,159
tune 40,000 parameters
 

3301
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,750
tune 40,000 parameters
as opposed to a full fine tune which

3302
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:21,760
as opposed to a full fine tune which
 

3303
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,870
as opposed to a full fine tune which
would be seven or eight billion

3304
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:22,880
would be seven or eight billion
 

3305
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,870
would be seven or eight billion
parameters.

3306
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:24,880
parameters.
 

3307
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,189
parameters.
And what people found was that for many

3308
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,199
And what people found was that for many
 

3309
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,149
And what people found was that for many
problems, the soft prompt was getting

3310
01:13:30,149 --> 01:13:30,159
problems, the soft prompt was getting
 

3311
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:32,709
problems, the soft prompt was getting
performance very very close to the full

3312
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:32,719
performance very very close to the full
 

3313
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:34,709
performance very very close to the full
fine-tune

3314
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:34,719
fine-tune
 

3315
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,630
fine-tune
at a radically reduced parameter count.

3316
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:40,640

 

3317
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,390

And what they found was that the bigger

3318
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:42,400
And what they found was that the bigger
 

3319
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,870
And what they found was that the bigger
the model got, the better the soft

3320
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:44,880
the model got, the better the soft
 

3321
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,550
the model got, the better the soft
prompt was doing.

3322
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:48,560

 

3323
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,030

So the bigger huge models, a small soft

3324
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:51,040
So the bigger huge models, a small soft
 

3325
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:55,669
So the bigger huge models, a small soft
prompt was able to control it very well.

3326
01:13:55,669 --> 01:13:55,679

 

3327
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,990

So people said okay if I don't want to

3328
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:58,000
So people said okay if I don't want to
 

3329
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,870
So people said okay if I don't want to
just do the prompt

3330
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:02,880
just do the prompt
 

3331
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,189
just do the prompt
remember the picture

3332
01:14:05,189 --> 01:14:05,199
remember the picture
 

3333
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:10,070
remember the picture
what is actually going

3334
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,080

 

3335
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,910

how is this pre-prompt actually

3336
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:11,920
how is this pre-prompt actually
 

3337
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,310
how is this pre-prompt actually
influencing everything over here it's

3338
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:14,320
influencing everything over here it's
 

3339
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,910
influencing everything over here it's
only influencing through the states and

3340
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:15,920
only influencing through the states and
 

3341
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,550
only influencing through the states and
the key value cache right all this is

3342
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:18,560
the key value cache right all this is
 

3343
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,149
the key value cache right all this is
going to go up and get turned into keys

3344
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:20,159
going to go up and get turned into keys
 

3345
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,830
going to go up and get turned into keys
and values and those are going to come

3346
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:21,840
and values and those are going to come
 

3347
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,070
and values and those are going to come
over here to interpret the question and

3348
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:24,080
over here to interpret the question and
 

3349
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,790
over here to interpret the question and
to give answers.

3350
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:26,800
to give answers.
 

3351
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,110
to give answers.
So if you wanted to have the full

3352
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:29,120
So if you wanted to have the full
 

3353
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,630
So if you wanted to have the full
tunability,

3354
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:30,640
tunability,
 

3355
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,830
tunability,
instead of just tuning just the

3356
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:33,840
instead of just tuning just the
 

3357
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,550
instead of just tuning just the
embedding, you just let the gradients

3358
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:36,560
embedding, you just let the gradients
 

3359
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,110
embedding, you just let the gradients
follow the keys and values and just copy

3360
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:39,120
follow the keys and values and just copy
 

3361
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,950
follow the keys and values and just copy
them. Say there's a special key value

3362
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:40,960
them. Say there's a special key value
 

3363
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:45,110
them. Say there's a special key value
pair for every head

3364
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,120
pair for every head
 

3365
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,390
pair for every head
and the gradients will fall into that

3366
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:46,400
and the gradients will fall into that
 

3367
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,669
and the gradients will fall into that
key value pair. That's it.

3368
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:49,679
key value pair. That's it.
 

3369
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,430
key value pair. That's it.
Does everyone see that qu? See, see, see

3370
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:51,440
Does everyone see that qu? See, see, see
 

3371
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,229
Does everyone see that qu? See, see, see
the as the gradient flows back this way,

3372
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:56,239
the as the gradient flows back this way,
 

3373
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:57,910
the as the gradient flows back this way,
the way it flows back is it hits the

3374
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:57,920
the way it flows back is it hits the
 

3375
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,910
the way it flows back is it hits the
keys and the values in the attention.

3376
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:01,920
keys and the values in the attention.
 

3377
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,590
keys and the values in the attention.
So just let the keys and the values

3378
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:03,600
So just let the keys and the values
 

3379
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,830
So just let the keys and the values
themselves mutate right there. Change

3380
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:07,840
themselves mutate right there. Change
 

3381
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,709
themselves mutate right there. Change
make them be learnable parameters.

3382
01:15:10,709 --> 01:15:10,719
make them be learnable parameters.
 

3383
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,270
make them be learnable parameters.
If I do that,

3384
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:13,280
If I do that,
 

3385
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:16,630
If I do that,
suppose there's 32 layers in this model.

3386
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:16,640
suppose there's 32 layers in this model.
 

3387
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,229
suppose there's 32 layers in this model.
I have 4,96 for all the keys of

I have 4,96 for all the keys of
multi-headed attention.

Right? The queries are generated this

In a transformer network attention, the

There's no past query state. The queries

There's no past query state. The queries
 

3429

There's no past query state. The queries
were consumed in the past. They don't

were consumed in the past. They don't
 

3431
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,950
were consumed in the past. They don't
proceed in the future. They influence

01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:18,960
proceed in the future. They influence
 

3433
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,910
proceed in the future. They influence
keys and values at the next layer. But

3434
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
keys and values at the next layer. But
 

3435
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,830
keys and values at the next layer. But
only keys and values go from the past

3436
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:23,840
only keys and values go from the past

So soft prompting extended to the entire

01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:29,679
So soft prompting extended to the entire
 

3441
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:33,030
So soft prompting extended to the entire

Nothing else. Yeah. Question.

>> No, no, no. Very important. Okay. Again,
you have a choice. What does it mean

3448
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:46,960
you have a choice. What does it mean
 

3449
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,550
you have a choice. What does it mean
precisely? You can think of it as that

3450
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:48,560
precisely? You can think of it as that
 

3451
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,189
precisely? You can think of it as that
there's literally a key. I just make

3452
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:51,199
there's literally a key. I just make
 

3453
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,830
there's literally a key. I just make
that key learnable. Alternatively, you

3454
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:53,840
that key learnable. Alternatively, you
 

3455
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:57,270
that key learnable. Alternatively, you
can think of it as I add a special

3456
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:57,280
can think of it as I add a special
 

3457
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,550
can think of it as I add a special
column to my key matrix. That's what the

3458
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:00,560
column to my key matrix. That's what the
 

3459
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,070
column to my key matrix. That's what the
key that would be generated here is.

3460
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
key that would be generated here is.
 

3461
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,510
key that would be generated here is.
And only that one will ever get looked

3462
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:05,520
And only that one will ever get looked
 

3463
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,870
And only that one will ever get looked
at. Your choice. It's easier to think of

3464
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:08,880
at. Your choice. It's easier to think of
 

3465
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,870
at. Your choice. It's easier to think of
it as just the key, the specific key

3466
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:10,880
it as just the key, the specific key
 

3467
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,070
it as just the key, the specific key
that's going to be generated for this

3468
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:12,080
that's going to be generated for this
 

3469
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,110
that's going to be generated for this
token at this layer and this head and

01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:15,120
token at this layer and this head and
 

3471
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:31,590
token at this layer and this head and
let that be a learnable parameter.

3472
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:31,600

3477
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:41,270

be precise. Um,

01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,870
zoom in. There's I don't know what the
answer for llama is. Let's suppose

3484
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:48,880
answer for llama is. Let's suppose
 

3485
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,709
answer for llama is. Let's suppose
there's 90 head. There's not 90 heads.

3486
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:50,719
there's 90 head. There's not 90 heads.
 

3487
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,030
there's 90 head. There's not 90 heads.
There's 60 heads.

3488
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:53,040
There's 60 heads.
 

3489
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,870
There's 60 heads.
64 heads, suppose. I don't know if

3490
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:54,880
64 heads, suppose. I don't know if
 

3491
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,830
64 heads, suppose. I don't know if
that's the right number, right? And so,

3492
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:57,840
that's the right number, right? And so,
 

3493
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,310
that's the right number, right? And so,
there's going to be

3494
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:00,320
there's going to be
 

3495
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:06,149
there's going to be
64 keys and 64 values.

special values
so that

3524
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:43,040
so that
 

3525
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:49,750
so that
what I get is I have 32 layers of

01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,669

times 100 sorry I didn't I didn't put

3528
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:51,679
times 100 sorry I didn't I didn't put
 

3529
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,030
times 100 sorry I didn't I didn't put
the final times 100 in here

the final times 100 in here
 

3531
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,950
the final times 100 in here
so this is let me label this this is

3532
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:56,960
so this is let me label this this is
 

3533
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,630
so this is let me label this this is
keys

3534
01:18:58,630 --> 01:18:58,640
keys
 

3535
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,270
keys
this is values

3536
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,280
this is values
 

3537
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,669
this is values
this is layers

3538
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:03,679
this is layers
 

3539
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:11,350
this is layers
and this This is 100

3541
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,270

26 million.

3542
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:13,280
26 million.
 

3543
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:17,830
26 million.
Okay. So I have 26 million which is

3544
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:17,840
Okay. So I have 26 million which is
 

3545
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,910
Okay. So I have 26 million which is
bigger than 40,000

3546
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:19,920
bigger than 40,000
 

3547
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:30,070
bigger than 40,000
but far far smaller than 8 billion.

3548
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:30,080

 

3549
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,430

>> Yes.

3550
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:31,440
>> Yes.
 

3551
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,030
>> Yes.
>> Yes.

3552
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:33,040
>> Yes.
 

3553
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:39,270
>> Yes.
Is each of the learning

3554
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:39,280

 

3555
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,229

prompt?

3556
01:19:40,229 --> 01:19:40,239
prompt?
 

3557
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,709
prompt?
>> So okay, this is called soft prompting

3558
01:19:42,709 --> 01:19:42,719
>> So okay, this is called soft prompting
 

3559
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,270
>> So okay, this is called soft prompting
up here

3560
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:45,280
up here
 

3561
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,510
up here
and this is called prefix.

3562
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:47,520
and this is called prefix.
 

3563
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,229
and this is called prefix.
Okay, or soft prefix

3564
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:52,239

 

3565
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:54,310

in a soft prefix. I'm just going to

3566
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:54,320
in a soft prefix. I'm just going to
 

3567
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,390
in a soft prefix. I'm just going to
learn the kvs

3568
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,400
learn the kvs
 

3569
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,030
learn the kvs
because these soft prompts, what did

3570
01:19:59,030 --> 01:19:59,040
because these soft prompts, what did
 

3571
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,110
because these soft prompts, what did
they affect? They affected the kvs.

3572
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:01,120
they affect? They affected the kvs.
 

3573
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,430
they affect? They affected the kvs.
That's how they actually affect what's

3574
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:03,440
That's how they actually affect what's
 

3575
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,870
That's how they actually affect what's
going to happen in the interpretation of

3576
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:04,880
going to happen in the interpretation of
 

3577
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,149
going to happen in the interpretation of
the question and the generation of the

3578
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:06,159
the question and the generation of the
 

3579
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:09,350
the question and the generation of the
answer. So I can just change the state

3580
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,360
answer. So I can just change the state
 

3581
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,990
answer. So I can just change the state
itself. This is making the entire state

3582
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:12,000
itself. This is making the entire state
 

3583
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,229
itself. This is making the entire state
learnable.

3584
01:20:14,229 --> 01:20:14,239
learnable.
 

3585
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:17,030
learnable.
So the entire state is learnable

3586
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,040
So the entire state is learnable
 

3587
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,950
So the entire state is learnable
basically on all the gradient paths.

3588
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:18,960
basically on all the gradient paths.
 

3589
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,390
basically on all the gradient paths.
When the gradient comes back to hit

3590
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:20,400
When the gradient comes back to hit
 

3591
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,470
When the gradient comes back to hit
these points, it just stops. Okay, I

3592
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:22,480
these points, it just stops. Okay, I
 

3593
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,470
these points, it just stops. Okay, I
will continue with Laura's next time,

3594
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:24,480
will continue with Laura's next time,
 

3595
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,990
will continue with Laura's next time,
but

3596
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:26,000
but
 

3597
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,510
but
comes back here and just stops there.

3598
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:31,520

 

3599
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,030

Okay. So, yeah, we'll continue next

3600
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:33,040
Okay. So, yeah, we'll continue next
 

3601
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,040
Okay. So, yeah, we'll continue next
time.
