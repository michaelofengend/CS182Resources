1
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:11,190

That's kind of

2
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200

 

3
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,870

>> Okay, we're at Berkeley time, so let's

4
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
>> Okay, we're at Berkeley time, so let's
 

5
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,990
>> Okay, we're at Berkeley time, so let's
get started.

6
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000
get started.
 

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,109
get started.
Before I start the official lecture

8
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:19,119
Before I start the official lecture
 

9
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,030
Before I start the official lecture
part, a important announcement. I wanted

10
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
part, a important announcement. I wanted
 

11
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,109
part, a important announcement. I wanted
to put the projects back on your radar

12
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:23,119
to put the projects back on your radar
 

13
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,590
to put the projects back on your radar
in case you've forgotten. But everyone

14
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
in case you've forgotten. But everyone
 

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,870
in case you've forgotten. But everyone
remember that we have projects in this

16
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
remember that we have projects in this
 

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,070
remember that we have projects in this
class. Yes. Okay. And that you have a

18
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,080
class. Yes. Okay. And that you have a
 

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,030
class. Yes. Okay. And that you have a
proposal for them due pretty soon. And

20
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
proposal for them due pretty soon. And
 

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,149
proposal for them due pretty soon. And
you have to meet with a staff member,

22
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
you have to meet with a staff member,
 

23
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,390
you have to meet with a staff member,
core staff member before submitting the

24
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
core staff member before submitting the
 

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,830
core staff member before submitting the
project proposal. Right? So we want you

26
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
project proposal. Right? So we want you
 

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,230
project proposal. Right? So we want you
to meet with us before you even submit

28
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
to meet with us before you even submit
 

29
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,990
to meet with us before you even submit
the first version so that if you have an

30
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
the first version so that if you have an
 

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,710
the first version so that if you have an
idea that is going to never work or

32
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
idea that is going to never work or
 

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,389
idea that is going to never work or
going to be impossibly hard or is going

34
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
going to be impossibly hard or is going
 

35
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,310
going to be impossibly hard or is going
to require infinite compute to be able

36
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
to require infinite compute to be able
 

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,910
to require infinite compute to be able
to

38
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
to
 

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,310
to
uh do we can try to have you know help

40
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
uh do we can try to have you know help
 

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,109
uh do we can try to have you know help
you have a proposal that is actually

42
00:01:59,109 --> 00:01:59,119
you have a proposal that is actually
 

43
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,950
you have a proposal that is actually
feasible doable within the scope of what

44
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
feasible doable within the scope of what
 

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,950
feasible doable within the scope of what
you have access to within this class.

46
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
you have access to within this class.
 

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,149
you have access to within this class.
Okay. So make sure you sign up. There's

48
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
Okay. So make sure you sign up. There's
 

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,309
Okay. So make sure you sign up. There's
a bunch of slots. Uh I have a bunch of

50
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:08,319
a bunch of slots. Uh I have a bunch of
 

51
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,910
a bunch of slots. Uh I have a bunch of
slots today right after class during

52
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:09,920
slots today right after class during
 

53
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,470
slots today right after class during
office hours. Um and the way we have it

54
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
office hours. Um and the way we have it
 

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,309
office hours. Um and the way we have it
set up is we've have have these set up

56
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
set up is we've have have these set up
 

57
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,550
set up is we've have have these set up
into 15 minute time slots per team,

58
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
into 15 minute time slots per team,
 

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,309
into 15 minute time slots per team,
right? So that you have to choose a time

60
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
right? So that you have to choose a time
 

61
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,470
right? So that you have to choose a time
slot so they were not, you know, 10

62
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
slot so they were not, you know, 10
 

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,070
slot so they were not, you know, 10
people don't suddenly show up to office

64
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
people don't suddenly show up to office
 

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,630
people don't suddenly show up to office
hours and there's you know not enough

66
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
hours and there's you know not enough
 

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,070
hours and there's you know not enough
time to talk to each of you. So we have

68
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
time to talk to each of you. So we have
 

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,630
time to talk to each of you. So we have
a sign up strategy so that everyone will

70
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
a sign up strategy so that everyone will
 

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,270
a sign up strategy so that everyone will
get time. Make sure that you sign up.

72
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
get time. Make sure that you sign up.
 

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,430
get time. Make sure that you sign up.
One sign up per team is required. So

74
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
One sign up per team is required. So
 

75
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,350
One sign up per team is required. So
basically one team member signs up and

76
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,360
basically one team member signs up and
 

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,750
basically one team member signs up and
invites the other people to to join.

78
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
invites the other people to to join.
 

79
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,270
invites the other people to to join.
Does that make sense? Any questions

80
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
Does that make sense? Any questions
 

81
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,070
Does that make sense? Any questions
about the project?

82
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,080
about the project?
 

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,949
about the project?
Okay, good. So just please remember to

84
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
Okay, good. So just please remember to
 

85
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,910
Okay, good. So just please remember to
uh to do that.

86
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
uh to do that.
 

87
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,670
uh to do that.
Um okay, great.

88
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
Um okay, great.
 

89
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,589
Um okay, great.
So with that then I'm going to start up

90
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
So with that then I'm going to start up
 

91
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,949
So with that then I'm going to start up
with the actual content of the lecture

92
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
with the actual content of the lecture
 

93
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,790
with the actual content of the lecture
and what we're going to be transitioning

94
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
and what we're going to be transitioning
 

95
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,509
and what we're going to be transitioning
to talk about today is attention

96
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
to talk about today is attention
 

97
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,990
to talk about today is attention
mechanisms. Okay. And building towards

98
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
mechanisms. Okay. And building towards
 

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,670
mechanisms. Okay. And building towards
talking about you know transformer

100
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
talking about you know transformer
 

101
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,910
talking about you know transformer
networks uh and transformer models in

102
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
networks uh and transformer models in
 

103
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,229
networks uh and transformer models in
the next lecture.

104
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
the next lecture.
 

105
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,710
the next lecture.
So we finished up state space and we

106
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
So we finished up state space and we
 

107
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,630
So we finished up state space and we
thought of state space as trying to

108
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
thought of state space as trying to
 

109
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,630
thought of state space as trying to
solve basically

110
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
solve basically
 

111
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,790
solve basically
one of the challenges with recurrent

112
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
one of the challenges with recurrent
 

113
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,350
one of the challenges with recurrent
neural networks right and this was um

114
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
neural networks right and this was um
 

115
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,270
neural networks right and this was um
what state space models did was that

116
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
what state space models did was that
 

117
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,750
what state space models did was that
they allowed you to you know use this

118
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
they allowed you to you know use this
 

119
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,830
they allowed you to you know use this
convolution perspective and therefore

120
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
convolution perspective and therefore
 

121
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,509
convolution perspective and therefore
parallelize your your training and have

122
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
parallelize your your training and have
 

123
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,430
parallelize your your training and have
a lot of benefit over uh or get around

124
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
a lot of benefit over uh or get around
 

125
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,630
a lot of benefit over uh or get around
some of the challenges in training

126
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
some of the challenges in training
 

127
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,030
some of the challenges in training
recurrent neural networks and the

128
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
recurrent neural networks and the
 

129
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,949
recurrent neural networks and the
strength of these state space models

130
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:40,959
strength of these state space models
 

131
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,589
strength of these state space models
really comes from the fact that you can

132
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
really comes from the fact that you can
 

133
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,830
really comes from the fact that you can
make this state very very large,

134
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
make this state very very large,
 

135
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,430
make this state very very large,
right? And by making the state very very

136
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
right? And by making the state very very
 

137
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,589
right? And by making the state very very
large, you can cram a bunch of different

138
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
large, you can cram a bunch of different
 

139
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,670
large, you can cram a bunch of different
information into it. And that allows you

140
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680
information into it. And that allows you
 

141
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,470
information into it. And that allows you
to get the kind of performance that you

142
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
to get the kind of performance that you
 

143
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,470
to get the kind of performance that you
can out of the state space models. And

144
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
can out of the state space models. And
 

145
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,789
can out of the state space models. And
the interesting thing is that remember

146
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
the interesting thing is that remember
 

147
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,309
the interesting thing is that remember
when you have the state space you have

148
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
when you have the state space you have
 

149
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,149
when you have the state space you have
the x which is your input you have the h

150
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
the x which is your input you have the h
 

151
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,670
the x which is your input you have the h
which is your hidden state and then you

152
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
which is your hidden state and then you
 

153
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,149
which is your hidden state and then you
have the y's which are your output the h

154
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
have the y's which are your output the h
 

155
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,509
have the y's which are your output the h
can be very big but the c matrix is

156
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
can be very big but the c matrix is
 

157
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,589
can be very big but the c matrix is
going to can shrink the y back down

158
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
going to can shrink the y back down
 

159
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,310
going to can shrink the y back down
right so you can have uh this

160
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
right so you can have uh this
 

161
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,509
right so you can have uh this
dimensionality reduction when you are

162
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
dimensionality reduction when you are
 

163
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,830
dimensionality reduction when you are
actually uh maybe going through the ml

164
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
actually uh maybe going through the ml
 

165
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,350
actually uh maybe going through the ml
so you don't have this massive

166
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
so you don't have this massive
 

167
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,590
so you don't have this massive
parameters and massive amount of u

168
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
parameters and massive amount of u
 

169
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,350
parameters and massive amount of u
massive size of the model even though

170
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
massive size of the model even though
 

171
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,870
massive size of the model even though
your state is actually quite big, right?

172
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
your state is actually quite big, right?
 

173
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,790
your state is actually quite big, right?
So that is one of the things that the

174
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
So that is one of the things that the
 

175
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,670
So that is one of the things that the
the state space models did. Today what

176
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
the state space models did. Today what
 

177
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,790
the state space models did. Today what
we're going to talk about is we're going

178
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
we're going to talk about is we're going
 

179
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,990
we're going to talk about is we're going
to talk about attention which is another

180
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
to talk about attention which is another
 

181
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,990
to talk about attention which is another
basically a different approach to uh

182
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
basically a different approach to uh
 

183
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,430
basically a different approach to uh
dealing with some of the challenges of

184
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
dealing with some of the challenges of
 

185
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,710
dealing with some of the challenges of
recurrent neural networks or in the

186
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
recurrent neural networks or in the
 

187
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,350
recurrent neural networks or in the
sense that it emerged also out of well

188
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
sense that it emerged also out of well
 

189
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,629
sense that it emerged also out of well
we're having trouble with recurrent

190
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
we're having trouble with recurrent
 

191
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,230
we're having trouble with recurrent
neural networks how can we uh get around

192
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,240
neural networks how can we uh get around
 

193
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,270
neural networks how can we uh get around
them and historically actually attention

194
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
them and historically actually attention
 

195
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,310
them and historically actually attention
in some sense came first right so uh

196
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
in some sense came first right so uh
 

197
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,830
in some sense came first right so uh
this attention is all you need and

198
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
this attention is all you need and
 

199
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,629
this attention is all you need and
attention was a thing even before this

200
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
attention was a thing even before this
 

201
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,390
attention was a thing even before this
famous attention is all you need paper

202
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
famous attention is all you need paper
 

203
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,150
famous attention is all you need paper
that came out of uh out of Google. So

204
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
that came out of uh out of Google. So
 

205
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,230
that came out of uh out of Google. So
attention had been being used and it was

206
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
attention had been being used and it was
 

207
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,670
attention had been being used and it was
being used along with basically RNN's to

208
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
being used along with basically RNN's to
 

209
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,909
being used along with basically RNN's to
try and improve their performance. But

210
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
try and improve their performance. But
 

211
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,670
try and improve their performance. But
then what people realized and we'll talk

212
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
then what people realized and we'll talk
 

213
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,749
then what people realized and we'll talk
about this is that actually you don't

214
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
about this is that actually you don't
 

215
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,510
about this is that actually you don't
need to have the RNN structure around

216
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
need to have the RNN structure around
 

217
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,310
need to have the RNN structure around
it. You can just have attention and that

218
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
it. You can just have attention and that
 

219
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,710
it. You can just have attention and that
can get you a lot of performance. and

220
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
can get you a lot of performance. and
 

221
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,070
can get you a lot of performance. and
the state space models work was done

222
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
the state space models work was done
 

223
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,469
the state space models work was done
separately and in some sense happened

224
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
separately and in some sense happened
 

225
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,909
separately and in some sense happened
after uh the

226
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
after uh the
 

227
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,870
after uh the
uh attention work happened. Okay, even

228
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
uh attention work happened. Okay, even
 

229
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,469
uh attention work happened. Okay, even
though I'm sure the ideas were in the

230
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
though I'm sure the ideas were in the
 

231
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,350
though I'm sure the ideas were in the
people's heads even before. Okay. So I

232
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
people's heads even before. Okay. So I
 

233
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,990
people's heads even before. Okay. So I
want to focus now on sequence problems

234
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
want to focus now on sequence problems
 

235
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,110
want to focus now on sequence problems
using RNNs. The key example that I'm

236
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
using RNNs. The key example that I'm
 

237
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,909
using RNNs. The key example that I'm
going to talk about is translation. So,

238
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
going to talk about is translation. So,
 

239
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,990
going to talk about is translation. So,
I'm thinking about translating a

240
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm thinking about translating a
 

241
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,870
I'm thinking about translating a
sentence from English to Chinese or

242
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
sentence from English to Chinese or
 

243
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,110
sentence from English to Chinese or
Marati, which is my mother tongue or

244
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
Marati, which is my mother tongue or
 

245
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,270
Marati, which is my mother tongue or
whatever other language that you uh

246
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
whatever other language that you uh
 

247
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,510
whatever other language that you uh
might want to do.

248
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
might want to do.
 

249
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,790
might want to do.
And the RNN style networks to do this um

250
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
And the RNN style networks to do this um
 

251
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,629
And the RNN style networks to do this um
use what we call an encoder decoder

252
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
use what we call an encoder decoder
 

253
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,430
use what we call an encoder decoder
architecture. Okay.

254
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
architecture. Okay.
 

255
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,590
architecture. Okay.
So here what you have basically for this

256
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
So here what you have basically for this
 

257
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,790
So here what you have basically for this
is you have [snorts] you have some input

258
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
is you have [snorts] you have some input
 

259
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,110
is you have [snorts] you have some input
and then you have a recurrent layer one

260
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
and then you have a recurrent layer one
 

261
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,230
and then you have a recurrent layer one
and a recurrent layer two and a

262
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
and a recurrent layer two and a
 

263
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,990
and a recurrent layer two and a
recurrent layer three so on and so forth

264
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
recurrent layer three so on and so forth
 

265
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,870
recurrent layer three so on and so forth
going up and this we will think of as

266
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
going up and this we will think of as
 

267
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,510
going up and this we will think of as
our encoder

268
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
our encoder
 

269
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,350
our encoder
and then you have a decoder which is you

270
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
and then you have a decoder which is you
 

271
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,950
and then you have a decoder which is you
know you have to start somewhere so you

272
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,960
know you have to start somewhere so you
 

273
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,350
know you have to start somewhere so you
will have what we call a start token and

274
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
will have what we call a start token and
 

275
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,550
will have what we call a start token and
then an RNN and RNN RN RN layers going

276
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
then an RNN and RNN RN RN layers going
 

277
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,350
then an RNN and RNN RN RN layers going
on top of each other and when I really

278
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
on top of each other and when I really
 

279
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,790
on top of each other and when I really
talk about an RNN block here. What I'm

280
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
talk about an RNN block here. What I'm
 

281
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,070
talk about an RNN block here. What I'm
thinking about is something I have my

282
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
thinking about is something I have my
 

283
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,909
thinking about is something I have my
input coming in. I have some hidden

284
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
input coming in. I have some hidden
 

285
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,430
input coming in. I have some hidden
state here. Here is kind of my uh loop

286
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,440
state here. Here is kind of my uh loop
 

287
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,790
state here. Here is kind of my uh loop
that is by RNN. Uh and then I have maybe

288
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
that is by RNN. Uh and then I have maybe
 

289
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,029
that is by RNN. Uh and then I have maybe
an MLP or something. I might also have a

290
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
an MLP or something. I might also have a
 

291
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,270
an MLP or something. I might also have a
normalization in here that I'm not

292
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
normalization in here that I'm not
 

293
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,550
normalization in here that I'm not
really showing. There'll be residual

294
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
really showing. There'll be residual
 

295
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,909
really showing. There'll be residual
connections. I'm not showing all of

296
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
connections. I'm not showing all of
 

297
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,589
connections. I'm not showing all of
that, but I'm just trying to give you

298
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
that, but I'm just trying to give you
 

299
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,670
that, but I'm just trying to give you
the spirit of what an RNN style network

300
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
the spirit of what an RNN style network
 

301
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,350
the spirit of what an RNN style network
for a sequence problem might look like.

302
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
for a sequence problem might look like.
 

303
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,189
for a sequence problem might look like.
Okay, just at a high level,

304
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
Okay, just at a high level,
 

305
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,350
Okay, just at a high level,
what I want to show here is that how

306
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
what I want to show here is that how
 

307
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,469
what I want to show here is that how
would this information from this encoder

308
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
would this information from this encoder
 

309
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,309
would this information from this encoder
get to this decoder? Right? So, what do

310
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
get to this decoder? Right? So, what do
 

311
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,070
get to this decoder? Right? So, what do
we want to do? we have a we have some

312
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
we want to do? we have a we have some
 

313
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,830
we want to do? we have a we have some
sentence um like

314
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
sentence um like
 

315
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,150
sentence um like
I don't know uh give me the book or give

316
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
I don't know uh give me the book or give
 

317
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,950
I don't know uh give me the book or give
me the paper and I want to translate it

318
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
me the paper and I want to translate it
 

319
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,469
me the paper and I want to translate it
into some uh some other language. So

320
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
into some uh some other language. So
 

321
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,909
into some uh some other language. So
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

322
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 

323
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,510
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
have this input sentence and I'm going

324
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
have this input sentence and I'm going
 

325
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,029
have this input sentence and I'm going
to feed it to my network. it is going to

326
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
to feed it to my network. it is going to
 

327
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,550
to feed it to my network. it is going to
generate some

328
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560

 

329
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,749

um hidden states in my RNN

330
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
um hidden states in my RNN
 

331
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,350
um hidden states in my RNN
and then after I've put in all of my

332
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
and then after I've put in all of my
 

333
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,350
and then after I've put in all of my
initial my sentence that I want to

334
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
initial my sentence that I want to
 

335
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,070
initial my sentence that I want to
translate then I'm going to try and

336
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
translate then I'm going to try and
 

337
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,150
translate then I'm going to try and
basically have the state information

338
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
basically have the state information
 

339
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,749
basically have the state information
that is present in my encoder move over

340
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
that is present in my encoder move over
 

341
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,070
that is present in my encoder move over
to my decoder so that then I can use

342
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
to my decoder so that then I can use
 

343
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,670
to my decoder so that then I can use
that as the state as the initial

344
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
that as the state as the initial
 

345
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,830
that as the state as the initial
condition to help me start up my

346
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
condition to help me start up my
 

347
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,070
condition to help me start up my
decoder. Okay? Because I want to

348
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
decoder. Okay? Because I want to
 

349
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,309
decoder. Okay? Because I want to
basically take information from my input

350
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
basically take information from my input
 

351
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,830
basically take information from my input
sentence which is in say let's say

352
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
sentence which is in say let's say
 

353
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,630
sentence which is in say let's say
English and then I want to use that

354
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
English and then I want to use that
 

355
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,350
English and then I want to use that
information about that sentence to

356
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
information about that sentence to
 

357
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,949
information about that sentence to
generate my translation in whatever

358
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
generate my translation in whatever
 

359
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,230
generate my translation in whatever
other language that I want to use.

360
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
other language that I want to use.
 

361
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,430
other language that I want to use.
Right? So I have to have a way of

362
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
Right? So I have to have a way of
 

363
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,110
Right? So I have to have a way of
connecting these two these two things

364
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
connecting these two these two things
 

365
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,509
connecting these two these two things
and the way that an RNN style network

366
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
and the way that an RNN style network
 

367
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,670
and the way that an RNN style network
would do that would be through

368
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
would do that would be through
 

369
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,910
would do that would be through
connecting

370
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
connecting
 

371
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,710
connecting
these uh RNN states. Okay, does that

372
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
these uh RNN states. Okay, does that
 

373
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,590
these uh RNN states. Okay, does that
make sense to everyone?

374
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
make sense to everyone?
 

375
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,910
make sense to everyone?
So if we think about this in some as

376
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
So if we think about this in some as
 

377
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,990
So if we think about this in some as
basically unrolling this, right? Let's

378
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
basically unrolling this, right? Let's
 

379
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,590
basically unrolling this, right? Let's
say I have some input sentence and my

380
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
say I have some input sentence and my
 

381
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,470
say I have some input sentence and my
input sentence is

382
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:06,480
input sentence is
 

383
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,430
input sentence is
says X1, X2, X3. This is representing my

384
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
says X1, X2, X3. This is representing my
 

385
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,030
says X1, X2, X3. This is representing my
input sentence. Let's say my input

386
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
input sentence. Let's say my input
 

387
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,310
input sentence. Let's say my input
sentence is length T long, capital T.

388
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
sentence is length T long, capital T.
 

389
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,590
sentence is length T long, capital T.
Okay,

390
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600

 

391
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,590

I'm trying to show this yellow block

392
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
I'm trying to show this yellow block
 

393
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,910
I'm trying to show this yellow block
here [snorts] unrolled

394
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
here [snorts] unrolled
 

395
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,310
here [snorts] unrolled
over here. This is my encoder. The green

396
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
over here. This is my encoder. The green
 

397
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,470
over here. This is my encoder. The green
block is my decoder and I'm showing it

398
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
block is my decoder and I'm showing it
 

399
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,230
block is my decoder and I'm showing it
over here.

400
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
over here.
 

401
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,990
over here.
Okay, so this we is representing all of

402
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay, so this we is representing all of
 

403
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,030
Okay, so this we is representing all of
the weights in that uh encoder block.

404
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
the weights in that uh encoder block.
 

405
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,630
the weights in that uh encoder block.
Everyone with me?

406
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640

 

407
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,790

I'm unrolling I've unrolled this to

408
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
I'm unrolling I've unrolled this to
 

409
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,670
I'm unrolling I've unrolled this to
through time. This is my input sentence.

410
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
through time. This is my input sentence.
 

411
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,070
through time. This is my input sentence.
But what is a key challenge that we're

412
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
But what is a key challenge that we're
 

413
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,190
But what is a key challenge that we're
going to to face here, right? So I have

414
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
going to to face here, right? So I have
 

415
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,670
going to to face here, right? So I have
I put in my first token. I do something.

416
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
I put in my first token. I do something.
 

417
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,269
I put in my first token. I do something.
Then comes the second token. Then comes

418
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
Then comes the second token. Then comes
 

419
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,790
Then comes the second token. Then comes
the third token. Then comes the last

420
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
the third token. Then comes the last
 

421
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,310
the third token. Then comes the last
token. So on and so forth. And then I

422
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
token. So on and so forth. And then I
 

423
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,150
token. So on and so forth. And then I
use

424
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
use
 

425
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,790
use
all of this to set the initial

426
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
all of this to set the initial
 

427
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,630
all of this to set the initial
conditions for my decoder

428
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
conditions for my decoder
 

429
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,590
conditions for my decoder
that is going to lead to the actual

430
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
that is going to lead to the actual
 

431
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,990
that is going to lead to the actual
translation. Okay,

432
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
translation. Okay,
 

433
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,670
translation. Okay,
it's important to remember here that the

434
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
it's important to remember here that the
 

435
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,710
it's important to remember here that the
first input that I put to my decoder,

436
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
first input that I put to my decoder,
 

437
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,910
first input that I put to my decoder,
I'm going to call it a start token. Um,

438
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm going to call it a start token. Um,
 

439
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,470
I'm going to call it a start token. Um,
as is always the case, we don't know

440
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
as is always the case, we don't know
 

441
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,069
as is always the case, we don't know
what to say for our start tokens. We

442
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
what to say for our start tokens. We
 

443
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,509
what to say for our start tokens. We
often choose to just learn what the

444
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
often choose to just learn what the
 

445
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,949
often choose to just learn what the
start token is.

446
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959

 

447
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,470

So let me just talk a little bit about

448
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
So let me just talk a little bit about
 

449
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,190
So let me just talk a little bit about
how this decoder is going to work.

450
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
how this decoder is going to work.
 

451
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,630
how this decoder is going to work.
Actually before I go to the decoder, let

452
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
Actually before I go to the decoder, let
 

453
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,550
Actually before I go to the decoder, let
me just talk about this this first

454
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
me just talk about this this first
 

455
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,190
me just talk about this this first
encoder thing. Okay, so I have an input

456
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
encoder thing. Okay, so I have an input
 

457
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,509
encoder thing. Okay, so I have an input
sentence of length t.

458
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
sentence of length t.
 

459
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,389
sentence of length t.
Now I need to somehow

460
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
Now I need to somehow
 

461
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,230
Now I need to somehow
have all of this information about this

462
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
have all of this information about this
 

463
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,870
have all of this information about this
sentence. Give me the paper. And so

464
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
sentence. Give me the paper. And so
 

465
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,710
sentence. Give me the paper. And so
maybe I' I've I can say something about

466
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
maybe I' I've I can say something about
 

467
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,990
maybe I' I've I can say something about
okay, this is about maybe this is about

468
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
okay, this is about maybe this is about
 

469
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,750
okay, this is about maybe this is about
a paper. Maybe it's about some kind of

470
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
a paper. Maybe it's about some kind of
 

471
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,829
a paper. Maybe it's about some kind of
transaction. There's some information in

472
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
transaction. There's some information in
 

473
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,477
transaction. There's some information in
that sentence. And the only thing that I

474
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:05,487
that sentence. And the only thing that I
 

475
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:07,670
that sentence. And the only thing that I
[clears throat] have by which I can

476
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
[clears throat] have by which I can
 

477
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,230
[clears throat] have by which I can
communicate this to the decoder

478
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
communicate this to the decoder
 

479
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,389
communicate this to the decoder
is this red dotted link in some sense,

480
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
is this red dotted link in some sense,
 

481
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,670
is this red dotted link in some sense,
right? And what am I using that red

482
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
right? And what am I using that red
 

483
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,389
right? And what am I using that red
dotted link to represent? I'm saying

484
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
dotted link to represent? I'm saying
 

485
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,470
dotted link to represent? I'm saying
that I want to be able to take all of

486
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
that I want to be able to take all of
 

487
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,870
that I want to be able to take all of
the state that has been generated here

488
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
the state that has been generated here
 

489
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,069
the state that has been generated here
and use it to set the initial condition

490
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
and use it to set the initial condition
 

491
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,110
and use it to set the initial condition
here.

492
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120

 

493
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,750

Okay. So is that it's all of the

494
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
Okay. So is that it's all of the
 

495
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,590
Okay. So is that it's all of the
information about that sentence has to

496
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
information about that sentence has to
 

497
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,190
information about that sentence has to
be captured into this one little state.

498
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
be captured into this one little state.
 

499
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,110
be captured into this one little state.
And so the only choices you have if you

500
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
And so the only choices you have if you
 

501
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,630
And so the only choices you have if you
want to communicate lots and lots of

502
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
want to communicate lots and lots of
 

503
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,389
want to communicate lots and lots of
information through that one state is to

504
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
information through that one state is to
 

505
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,230
information through that one state is to
make that state very very big but making

506
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
make that state very very big but making
 

507
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,910
make that state very very big but making
the state big makes things very very

508
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
the state big makes things very very
 

509
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,949
the state big makes things very very
difficult to train. So do you see the

510
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
difficult to train. So do you see the
 

511
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:03,509
difficult to train. So do you see the
tension here that one is facing

512
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519

 

513
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,870

>> questions I feel like people are not

514
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
>> questions I feel like people are not
 

515
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,629
>> questions I feel like people are not
with me fully yet.

516
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639

 

517
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,069

>> Yes.

518
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079

 

519
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,030

>> Is that the the last layer and the last

520
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
>> Is that the the last layer and the last
 

521
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,670
>> Is that the the last layer and the last

522
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680

523
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,350
time.
>> It is not the last layer. Okay, let me

524
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
>> It is not the last layer. Okay, let me
 

525
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,110
>> It is not the last layer. Okay, let me
do this again. So this yellow block is

526
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
do this again. So this yellow block is
 

527
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,389
do this again. So this yellow block is
that whole yellow block.

528
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:28,399
that whole yellow block.
 

529
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,430
that whole yellow block.
I make this smaller.

530
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
I make this smaller.
 

531
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,110
I make this smaller.
This yellow is this yellow.

532
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
This yellow is this yellow.
 

533
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,910
This yellow is this yellow.
Okay. And I'm so using we to represent

534
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
Okay. And I'm so using we to represent
 

535
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,550
Okay. And I'm so using we to represent
all of the weights of all of the RNN

536
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
all of the weights of all of the RNN
 

537
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,870
all of the weights of all of the RNN
everything there. And what I'm going to

538
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
everything there. And what I'm going to
 

539
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,590
everything there. And what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say let me run this

540
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
do is I'm going to say let me run this
 

541
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,110
do is I'm going to say let me run this
RNN for t time steps because I'm going

542
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
RNN for t time steps because I'm going
 

543
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,069
RNN for t time steps because I'm going
to unroll it. So horizontal the the x-

544
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
to unroll it. So horizontal the the x-
 

545
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,190
to unroll it. So horizontal the the x-
axis is is my time dimension. The y-axis

546
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200
axis is is my time dimension. The y-axis
 

547
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,949
axis is is my time dimension. The y-axis
is my layers, right? Vertically I'm

548
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
is my layers, right? Vertically I'm
 

549
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,550
is my layers, right? Vertically I'm
going by layers. Horizontally I'm going

550
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
going by layers. Horizontally I'm going
 

551
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,949
going by layers. Horizontally I'm going
by time. So this is all just what is

552
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
by time. So this is all just what is
 

553
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,030
by time. So this is all just what is
happening when I you know give me the

554
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
happening when I you know give me the
 

555
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,190
happening when I you know give me the
book. Okay. So this is I'm advancing in

556
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
book. Okay. So this is I'm advancing in
 

557
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,829
book. Okay. So this is I'm advancing in
my sequence

558
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
my sequence
 

559
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,069
my sequence
and then I essentially have basically

560
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
and then I essentially have basically
 

561
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,230
and then I essentially have basically
like a dotted red connection from here

562
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
like a dotted red connection from here
 

563
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,949
like a dotted red connection from here
to here and from here to here. So that

564
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
to here and from here to here. So that
 

565
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,750
to here and from here to here. So that
whatever at time at sequence position t

566
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
whatever at time at sequence position t
 

567
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,629
whatever at time at sequence position t
or at time t

568
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
or at time t
 

569
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,269
or at time t
whatever the state here is I use that to

570
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
whatever the state here is I use that to
 

571
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,230
whatever the state here is I use that to
make the initial condition for this for

572
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
make the initial condition for this for
 

573
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,790
make the initial condition for this for
the decoder.

574
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
the decoder.
 

575
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,509
the decoder.
Right? So I I run this until the input

576
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
Right? So I I run this until the input
 

577
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,590
Right? So I I run this until the input
sentence is done

578
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600

 

579
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,829

and I'm then moving that information

580
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
and I'm then moving that information
 

581
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,310
and I'm then moving that information
over to the decoder to start the

582
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
over to the decoder to start the
 

583
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,470
over to the decoder to start the
translation

584
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
translation
 

585
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,670
translation
through the state. So all I have to

586
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,680
through the state. So all I have to
 

587
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,509
through the state. So all I have to
communicate between the encoder and the

588
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
communicate between the encoder and the
 

589
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,069
communicate between the encoder and the
decoder is whatever ends up inside here

590
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
decoder is whatever ends up inside here
 

591
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,949
decoder is whatever ends up inside here
after t time steps.

592
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959

 

593
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:11,910

>> Yes.

594
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920

 

595
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,310

>> Yes.

596
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
>> Yes.
 

597
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,949
>> Yes.
>> Yes.

598
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
>> Yes.
 

599
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,590
>> Yes.
Yes. So does that limit our length of

600
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
Yes. So does that limit our length of
 

601
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,110
Yes. So does that limit our length of
our output sequence?

602
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
our output sequence?
 

603
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,030
our output sequence?
>> Does it limit the length of the output

604
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
>> Does it limit the length of the output
 

605
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,949
>> Does it limit the length of the output
sequence? No, it does not. Right? That's

606
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
sequence? No, it does not. Right? That's
 

607
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,230
sequence? No, it does not. Right? That's
the magic in some sense of RNN's

608
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
the magic in some sense of RNN's
 

609
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,990
the magic in some sense of RNN's
because I can keep generating as long as

610
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
because I can keep generating as long as
 

611
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,230
because I can keep generating as long as
I want because

612
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,240
I want because
 

613
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,509
I want because
this is the unrolled version

614
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:37,519
this is the unrolled version
 

615
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,150
this is the unrolled version
but the non the the tight version or the

616
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
but the non the the tight version or the
 

617
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,990
but the non the the tight version or the
compact version you have like the the

618
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
compact version you have like the the
 

619
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,069
compact version you have like the the
RNN you can keep running the RNN until

620
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
RNN you can keep running the RNN until
 

621
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,949
RNN you can keep running the RNN until
you're done right

622
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:48,959
you're done right
 

623
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,030
you're done right
so it does not like and and this is

624
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
so it does not like and and this is
 

625
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,389
so it does not like and and this is
really important for translation because

626
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
really important for translation because
 

627
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,990
really important for translation because
a short sentence in one language might

628
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
a short sentence in one language might
 

629
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,629
a short sentence in one language might
be a longer sentence in a lang another

630
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
be a longer sentence in a lang another
 

631
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,949
be a longer sentence in a lang another
language. And the other key problem that

we're going to talk about is that and

634
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
we're going to talk about is that and
 

635
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,629
we're going to talk about is that and
one of the motivating things for

636
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
one of the motivating things for
 

637
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,150
one of the motivating things for
attention is that sentence word order in

638
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
attention is that sentence word order in

in sentences is not preserved when you
 

641
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,230
in sentences is not preserved when you
translate. Right? So you can have the

643
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,629

same words but they might be in
 

645
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,230
same words but they might be in
different orders. It's not like you

different orders. It's not like you
 

647
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,829

I basically need to feed the decoder

I basically need to feed the decoder
 

691
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,990
I basically need to feed the decoder
with something to start. It's an RNN. It

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
with something to start. It's an RNN. It
 

693
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,470
with something to start. It's an RNN. It
has to have some input. So, what do I

694
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
has to have some input. So, what do I
 

695
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,590
has to have some input. So, what do I
put into it? The idea of a start token

696
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
put into it? The idea of a start token
 

697
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,949
put into it? The idea of a start token
is saying we want to just get the

is saying we want to just get the
 

699
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,910
is saying we want to just get the
decoder going. And so this is just some

decoder going. And so this is just some
 

701
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,590

way of saying let's go

00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
way of saying let's go
 

703
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,949
way of saying let's go

because we don't know what is the right
 

705
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,829
because we don't know what is the right
start token. We often will just learn

start token. We often will just learn
 

707
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,590
start token. We often will just learn
the value of the start token.

708

00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
unrolled, right? So the number of So
 

807
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,710
unrolled, right? So the number of So
remember we talked about RNN's and we

808
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
remember we talked about RNN's and we
 

809
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,270
remember we talked about RNN's and we
had like this unrolling perspective. So

810
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
had like this unrolling perspective. So
 

811
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,669
had like this unrolling perspective. So
I am all I'm doing is unrolling. I'm

812
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
I am all I'm doing is unrolling. I'm
 

813
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,110
I am all I'm doing is unrolling. I'm
trying to visualize the unrolling and

814
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
trying to visualize the unrolling and
 

815
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,150
trying to visualize the unrolling and
that makes it seem like there's

816
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
that makes it seem like there's
 

817
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,350
that makes it seem like there's
different blocks, but there's not

818
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
different blocks, but there's not
 

819
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,470
different blocks, but there's not
different blocks,

820
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
different blocks,
 

821
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,870
different blocks,
right? It's the same RNN just at

822
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
right? It's the same RNN just at
 

823
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,070
right? It's the same RNN just at
different time steps.

824
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
different time steps.
 

825
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,669
different time steps.
It's not different blocks. It's really

826
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
It's not different blocks. It's really
 

827
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,430
It's not different blocks. It's really
important. These are not different

828
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
important. These are not different
 

829
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,590
important. These are not different
blocks. This is the same block at

830
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
blocks. This is the same block at
 

831
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,470
blocks. This is the same block at
different times.

832
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480

 

833
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,830

>> Yes.

834
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
>> Yes.
 

835
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,750
>> Yes.
>> Is um are the layers like they're like

836
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
>> Is um are the layers like they're like
 

837
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,669
>> Is um are the layers like they're like
they have the same amounts of layers and

838
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
they have the same amounts of layers and
 

839
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,669
they have the same amounts of layers and
the encoders and decoders?

840
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
the encoders and decoders?
 

841
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,590
the encoders and decoders?
>> Yes. The number of layers. So here there

842
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,600
>> Yes. The number of layers. So here there
 

843
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,909
>> Yes. The number of layers. So here there
is a correspondence,

844
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
is a correspondence,
 

845
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,590
is a correspondence,
right? I I think everyone's getting

846
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
right? I I think everyone's getting
 

847
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,430
right? I I think everyone's getting
confused between horizontal and vertical

848
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
confused between horizontal and vertical
 

849
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,669
confused between horizontal and vertical
directions, right? Horizontal is time,

850
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
directions, right? Horizontal is time,
 

851
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,230
directions, right? Horizontal is time,
vertical is layers. So these here,

852
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
vertical is layers. So these here,
 

853
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,549
vertical is layers. So these here,
these are layers. This is the first

854
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559
these are layers. This is the first
 

855
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,070
these are layers. This is the first
layer. This is the second layer. This is

856
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
layer. This is the second layer. This is
 

857
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,789
layer. This is the second layer. This is
the third layer. So on and so forth. And

858
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
the third layer. So on and so forth. And
 

859
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,789
the third layer. So on and so forth. And
there's a correspondence between layers

860
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
there's a correspondence between layers
 

861
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,909
there's a correspondence between layers
of the encoder to layers of the decoder

862
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:23,919

 

863
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,549

because I'm using the state of each

864
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:26,559
because I'm using the state of each
 

865
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,350
because I'm using the state of each
layer to basically jump start the

866
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,360
layer to basically jump start the
 

867
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,710
layer to basically jump start the
decoder.

868
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:32,720

 

869
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,710

But there is not a correspondence

870
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:34,720
But there is not a correspondence
 

871
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,630
But there is not a correspondence
between how many time like this has

872
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
between how many time like this has
 

873
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,750
between how many time like this has
nothing to do this part how long this is

874
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:41,760
nothing to do this part how long this is
 

875
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,190
nothing to do this part how long this is
has nothing to do with the architecture.

876
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
has nothing to do with the architecture.
 

877
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,870
has nothing to do with the architecture.
This has to do with your input. Your

878
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
This has to do with your input. Your
 

879
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,990
This has to do with your input. Your
input will change every time.

880
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
input will change every time.
 

881
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,590
input will change every time.
So for short sentences this will be

882
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
So for short sentences this will be
 

883
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,110
So for short sentences this will be
short for long sentences it will be

884
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,120
short for long sentences it will be
 

885
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,310
short for long sentences it will be
long.

886
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
long.
 

887
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:52,789
long.
>> Yes.

888
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
>> Yes.
 

889
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,630
>> Yes.
>> Architecturally required that the input

890
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
>> Architecturally required that the input
 

891
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,149
>> Architecturally required that the input
and output have the same number of

892
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
and output have the same number of
 

893
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,750
and output have the same number of
layers or is that just like a common

894
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
layers or is that just like a common
 

895
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,669
layers or is that just like a common
convention?

896
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
convention?
 

897
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,950
convention?
Um, in this kind of network they are the

898
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:02,960
Um, in this kind of network they are the
 

899
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,630
Um, in this kind of network they are the
same.

900
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
same.
 

901
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,950
same.
In

902
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:06,960
In
 

903
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,270
In
like modern transformer networks now

904
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
like modern transformer networks now
 

905
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,870
like modern transformer networks now
where you have an encoder decoder

906
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880
where you have an encoder decoder
 

907
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,710
where you have an encoder decoder
structure they are not necessarily

908
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
structure they are not necessarily
 

909
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,310
structure they are not necessarily
always the same but we're not like in in

910
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,320
always the same but we're not like in in
 

911
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,230
always the same but we're not like in in
this one this is yes it is it is

912
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
this one this is yes it is it is
 

913
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:26,950
this one this is yes it is it is
required to be the same.

914
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960

 

915
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,029

Okay. Okay, is everyone with me now?

916
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
Okay. Okay, is everyone with me now?
 

917
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,990
Okay. Okay, is everyone with me now?
Yes. No. Thumbs up, thumbs downs. Okay,

918
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
Yes. No. Thumbs up, thumbs downs. Okay,
 

919
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,310
Yes. No. Thumbs up, thumbs downs. Okay,
did the discussion helped? Okay, good.

920
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320
did the discussion helped? Okay, good.
 

921
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,870
did the discussion helped? Okay, good.
So, horizontal is time, vertical is

922
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
So, horizontal is time, vertical is
 

923
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,430
So, horizontal is time, vertical is
layers. What we want to do is we want to

924
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
layers. What we want to do is we want to
 

925
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,750
layers. What we want to do is we want to
translate a sentence.

926
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
translate a sentence.
 

927
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,109
translate a sentence.
Okay.

928
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:44,119
Okay.
 

929
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,710
Okay.
[clears throat]

930
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720

 

931
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,789

So, the key problem that we have is that

932
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
So, the key problem that we have is that
 

933
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,990
So, the key problem that we have is that
this thing is a is a bottleneck, right?

934
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
this thing is a is a bottleneck, right?
 

935
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,669
this thing is a is a bottleneck, right?
This is the only thing I'm drawing this

936
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
This is the only thing I'm drawing this
 

937
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,350
This is the only thing I'm drawing this
arrow here and this is I'm drawing a

938
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
arrow here and this is I'm drawing a
 

939
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,830
arrow here and this is I'm drawing a
dotted arrow here because it is not like

940
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
dotted arrow here because it is not like
 

941
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,190
dotted arrow here because it is not like
I'm taking this and passing this

942
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
I'm taking this and passing this
 

943
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,789
I'm taking this and passing this
forward. I'm just drawing this as like

944
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:02,799
forward. I'm just drawing this as like
 

945
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,990
forward. I'm just drawing this as like
this is the way this is where the

946
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,000
this is the way this is where the
 

947
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,230
this is the way this is where the
information is being passed but the

948
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,240
information is being passed but the
 

949
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,789
information is being passed but the
information is being passed through the

950
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:08,799
information is being passed through the
 

951
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,830
information is being passed through the
state of this and that state is being

952
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
state of this and that state is being
 

953
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,909
state of this and that state is being
used to populate this state which then

954
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
used to populate this state which then
 

955
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,190
used to populate this state which then
again gets unrolled. Okay, but all I

956
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,200
again gets unrolled. Okay, but all I
 

957
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,430
again gets unrolled. Okay, but all I
have is that state

958
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
have is that state
 

959
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,669
have is that state
to communicate to the decoder. And if I

960
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
to communicate to the decoder. And if I
 

961
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,390
to communicate to the decoder. And if I
have a really long sentence, then that's

962
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
have a really long sentence, then that's
 

963
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,990
have a really long sentence, then that's
a lot of information that has to be

964
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,000
a lot of information that has to be
 

965
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,510
a lot of information that has to be
crammed into this small bottleneck.

966
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,520
crammed into this small bottleneck.
 

967
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,029
crammed into this small bottleneck.
And that that's challenging. Okay.

968
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039

 

969
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,950

So, what do we do to solve this

970
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
So, what do we do to solve this
 

971
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,350
So, what do we do to solve this
bottleneck? Okay. And that's what we're

972
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
bottleneck? Okay. And that's what we're
 

973
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,630
bottleneck? Okay. And that's what we're
going to kind of uh try to try to get

974
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
going to kind of uh try to try to get
 

975
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,029
going to kind of uh try to try to get
at. Before I get at that,

976
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039
at. Before I get at that,
 

977
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,470
at. Before I get at that,
I wanted to just explain this idea of uh

978
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
I wanted to just explain this idea of uh
 

979
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,390
I wanted to just explain this idea of uh
training this kind of network and it's

980
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
training this kind of network and it's
 

981
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,950
training this kind of network and it's
called it has a funny name. It's called

982
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
called it has a funny name. It's called
 

983
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,510
called it has a funny name. It's called
teacher forcing

984
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520

 

985
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,190

what this is done. So how would you

986
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,200
what this is done. So how would you
 

987
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,789
what this is done. So how would you
train this kind of thing, right? How are

988
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
train this kind of thing, right? How are
 

989
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,510
train this kind of thing, right? How are
we going to train this kind of thing?

990
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
we going to train this kind of thing?
 

991
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,270
we going to train this kind of thing?
What I'm going to do is I'm going to at

992
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,280
What I'm going to do is I'm going to at
 

993
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,590
What I'm going to do is I'm going to at
train time I'm going to put in my input,

994
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:09,600
train time I'm going to put in my input,
 

995
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,990
train time I'm going to put in my input,
right? So, I'm going to put in give me

996
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
right? So, I'm going to put in give me
 

997
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,470
right? So, I'm going to put in give me
the book. [snorts]

998
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:14,480
the book. [snorts]
 

999
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,669
the book. [snorts]
And then I'm going to go to my decoder

1000
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:17,679
And then I'm going to go to my decoder
 

1001
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,590
And then I'm going to go to my decoder
and I'm going to put in the start token

1002
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:19,600
and I'm going to put in the start token
 

1003
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,430
and I'm going to put in the start token
and it's going to output something,

1004
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
and it's going to output something,
 

1005
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,990
and it's going to output something,
right? It's going to maybe output this

1006
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
right? It's going to maybe output this
 

1007
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,710
right? It's going to maybe output this
Y1 hat. Now, there's a couple of things

1008
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:26,720
Y1 hat. Now, there's a couple of things
 

1009
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,990
Y1 hat. Now, there's a couple of things
to think that I want to point out. One,

1010
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
to think that I want to point out. One,
 

1011
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,430
to think that I want to point out. One,
we've already said we don't know how to

1012
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
we've already said we don't know how to
 

1013
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,549
we've already said we don't know how to
start. So, we're going to learn the

1014
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559
start. So, we're going to learn the
 

1015
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,190
start. So, we're going to learn the
start token. That's thing one. But then,

1016
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
start token. That's thing one. But then,
 

1017
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,549
start token. That's thing one. But then,
what do we do for this next guy? What

1018
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
what do we do for this next guy? What
 

1019
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,310
what do we do for this next guy? What
are our choices for what to put in here?

1020
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,320
are our choices for what to put in here?
 

1021
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,909
are our choices for what to put in here?
There's a couple of different choices,

1022
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:43,919
There's a couple of different choices,
 

1023
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,830
There's a couple of different choices,
right?

1024
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
right?
 

1025
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,230
right?
One is what we do at train time and one

1026
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
One is what we do at train time and one
 

1027
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,549
One is what we do at train time and one
is what we do at test time. So at test

1028
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
is what we do at test time. So at test
 

1029
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,149
is what we do at test time. So at test
time or at inference time, what we want

1030
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159
time or at inference time, what we want
 

1031
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,470
time or at inference time, what we want
to do is we want this decoder to just be

1032
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,480
to do is we want this decoder to just be
 

1033
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,909
to do is we want this decoder to just be
able to generate stuff one after the

1034
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
able to generate stuff one after the
 

1035
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,029
able to generate stuff one after the
other, one after the other, one after

1036
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
other, one after the other, one after
 

1037
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,350
other, one after the other, one after
the other. So for test time, what we're

1038
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
the other. So for test time, what we're
 

1039
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,830
the other. So for test time, what we're
going to do is going to have auto

1040
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:01,840
going to do is going to have auto
 

1041
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,430
going to do is going to have auto
reggressive generation. So, what I'm

1042
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440
reggressive generation. So, what I'm
 

1043
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,630
reggressive generation. So, what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say, well,

1044
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
going to do is I'm going to say, well,
 

1045
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,510
going to do is I'm going to say, well,
here I said start.

1046
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,520
here I said start.
 

1047
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,710
here I said start.
Whatever comes out of here, I'm going to

1048
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
Whatever comes out of here, I'm going to
 

1049
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,950
Whatever comes out of here, I'm going to
feed it back in

1050
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
feed it back in
 

1051
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,350
feed it back in
to here. And then that's kind of the

1052
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
to here. And then that's kind of the
 

1053
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,590
to here. And then that's kind of the
input for the next thing to start,

1054
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
input for the next thing to start,
 

1055
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,549
input for the next thing to start,
right? Because essentially I'm saying,

1056
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
right? Because essentially I'm saying,
 

1057
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,870
right? Because essentially I'm saying,
you know, give me the book. Mari would

1058
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:22,880
you know, give me the book. Mari would
 

1059
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,630
you know, give me the book. Mari would
be so I will take that first word, feed

1060
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
be so I will take that first word, feed
 

1061
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,870
be so I will take that first word, feed
it back in, and then hope that the next

1062
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:28,880
it back in, and then hope that the next
 

1063
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,830
it back in, and then hope that the next
word would come back out, right?

1064
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840

 

1065
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,510

And there I'm just hoping that whatever

1066
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
And there I'm just hoping that whatever
 

1067
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,390
And there I'm just hoping that whatever
I generated in from the first time step

1068
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
I generated in from the first time step
 

1069
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,190
I generated in from the first time step
was the right thing. Okay. [snorts] And

1070
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
was the right thing. Okay. [snorts] And
 

1071
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,470
was the right thing. Okay. [snorts] And
that's that's what's going to happen at

1072
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,480
that's that's what's going to happen at
 

1073
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,789
that's that's what's going to happen at
inference time.

1074
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
inference time.
 

1075
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,070
inference time.
At train time, it turns out that you

1076
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,080
At train time, it turns out that you
 

1077
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,830
At train time, it turns out that you
don't want to be feeding the decoder

1078
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:49,840
don't want to be feeding the decoder
 

1079
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,830
don't want to be feeding the decoder
with mistakes,

1080
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840
with mistakes,
 

1081
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,870
with mistakes,
right? You want to try and align what

1082
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
right? You want to try and align what
 

1083
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,470
right? You want to try and align what
the decoder has to to be as close to the

1084
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
the decoder has to to be as close to the
 

1085
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,149
the decoder has to to be as close to the
correct stuff as possible. So

1086
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
correct stuff as possible. So
 

1087
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,710
correct stuff as possible. So
even at test time, at training time,

1088
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
even at test time, at training time,
 

1089
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,549
even at test time, at training time,
even if let's say the first time step

1090
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:06,559
even if let's say the first time step
 

1091
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,710
even if let's say the first time step
outputed some kind of garbage,

1092
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
outputed some kind of garbage,
 

1093
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,549
outputed some kind of garbage,
I'm not going to take that token. I'm

1094
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
I'm not going to take that token. I'm
 

1095
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,630
I'm not going to take that token. I'm
not going to take this yhat and feed it

1096
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
not going to take this yhat and feed it
 

1097
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,390
not going to take this yhat and feed it
back in here. What I'm going to do is

1098
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
back in here. What I'm going to do is
 

1099
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,710
back in here. What I'm going to do is
instead I'm going to say, "Hey, look, I

1100
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:18,720
instead I'm going to say, "Hey, look, I
 

1101
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,430
instead I'm going to say, "Hey, look, I
have training data. Lucky me. I'm going

1102
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,440
have training data. Lucky me. I'm going
 

1103
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,909
have training data. Lucky me. I'm going
to feed in the true y."

1104
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:25,919

 

1105
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,990

And then I'm going to take my loss on

1106
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000
And then I'm going to take my loss on
 

1107
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,590
And then I'm going to take my loss on
that on the y on the on the y2 hat

1108
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
that on the y on the on the y2 hat
 

1109
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,950
that on the y on the on the y2 hat
that's generated from my true y1. Okay.

1110
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:34,960
that's generated from my true y1. Okay.
 

1111
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,630
that's generated from my true y1. Okay.
So when I'm computing the losses on

1112
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:36,640
So when I'm computing the losses on
 

1113
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,549
So when I'm computing the losses on
this, I'm going to compute losses on all

1114
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:38,559
this, I'm going to compute losses on all
 

1115
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,230
this, I'm going to compute losses on all
of these that's going to what that's

1116
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,240
of these that's going to what that's
 

1117
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,990
of these that's going to what that's
going to that is what is going to make

1118
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
going to that is what is going to make
 

1119
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,190
going to that is what is going to make
my gradients flow back through.

1120
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,200
my gradients flow back through.
 

1121
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,510
my gradients flow back through.
But then I'm going to have these true

1122
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
But then I'm going to have these true
 

1123
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,909
But then I'm going to have these true
wise and those are going to be given as

1124
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
wise and those are going to be given as
 

1125
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,269
wise and those are going to be given as
inputs so that I'm not putting the auto

1126
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
inputs so that I'm not putting the auto
 

1127
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,350
inputs so that I'm not putting the auto
reggressive generated stuff back into

1128
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,360
reggressive generated stuff back into
 

1129
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,029
reggressive generated stuff back into
the network because it might be wrong

1130
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
the network because it might be wrong
 

1131
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,549
the network because it might be wrong
and then who knows like and I'm just

1132
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559
and then who knows like and I'm just
 

1133
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,390
and then who knows like and I'm just
learning to predict the wrong something

1134
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,400
learning to predict the wrong something
 

1135
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,110
learning to predict the wrong something
from the wrong thing and like doesn't

1136
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
from the wrong thing and like doesn't
 

1137
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,630
from the wrong thing and like doesn't
work out. So it turns out it works out

1138
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
work out. So it turns out it works out
 

1139
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,390
work out. So it turns out it works out
works better to do what is called

1140
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,400
works better to do what is called
 

1141
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,710
works better to do what is called
teacher forcing. It's called basically

1142
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
teacher forcing. It's called basically
 

1143
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,310
teacher forcing. It's called basically
you're forcing the right output, right?

1144
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
you're forcing the right output, right?
 

1145
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,470
you're forcing the right output, right?
That's why it's teacher forcing.

1146
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480

 

1147
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,789

So even if this was wrong, you put the

1148
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
So even if this was wrong, you put the
 

1149
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,110
So even if this was wrong, you put the
right input in here. And this is a

1150
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,120
right input in here. And this is a
 

1151
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,870
right input in here. And this is a
standard technique that's used for this

1152
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
standard technique that's used for this
 

1153
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,909
standard technique that's used for this
kind of uh problem where you have you

1154
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:23,919
kind of uh problem where you have you
 

1155
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,190
kind of uh problem where you have you
want to be able to generate auto

1156
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,200
want to be able to generate auto
 

1157
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,549
want to be able to generate auto
reggressively. So at test time, at

1158
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:26,559
reggressively. So at test time, at
 

1159
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,830
reggressively. So at test time, at
inference time, you're not going to be

1160
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
inference time, you're not going to be
 

1161
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,190
inference time, you're not going to be
doing this because you don't know what

1162
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,200
doing this because you don't know what
 

1163
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,430
doing this because you don't know what
the ground truth translation is. But at

1164
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,440
the ground truth translation is. But at
 

1165
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,789
the ground truth translation is. But at
train time, this is what you're going to

1166
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
train time, this is what you're going to
 

1167
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,390
train time, this is what you're going to
do.

1168
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,400

 

1169
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,110

1170
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,120

1179
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,950
this. I forgot to mention this. So,
thank you. So, when we have these uh

1180
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
thank you. So, when we have these uh
 

1181
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,669
thank you. So, when we have these uh
RNNs, what is this generating? Right?

1182
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
RNNs, what is this generating? Right?
 

1183
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,110
RNNs, what is this generating? Right?
This uh layer is generating

1184
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
This uh layer is generating
 

1185
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,269
This uh layer is generating
um I'm doing some let's say I'm doing

1186
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
um I'm doing some let's say I'm doing
 

1187
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,710
um I'm doing some let's say I'm doing
some kind of soft max. I'm getting a

1188
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720
some kind of soft max. I'm getting a
 

1189
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,830
some kind of soft max. I'm getting a
bunch of probabilities on output tokens.

1190
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
bunch of probabilities on output tokens.
 

1191
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,590
bunch of probabilities on output tokens.
Okay.

1192
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:05,600

 

1193
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,590

But now when I'm doing an actual

1194
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
But now when I'm doing an actual
 

1195
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,710
But now when I'm doing an actual
generation, like if I was doing a

1196
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:08,720
generation, like if I was doing a
 

1197
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,470
generation, like if I was doing a
classification task, maybe probabilities

1198
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
classification task, maybe probabilities
 

1199
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,710
classification task, maybe probabilities
are good enough.

1200
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:12,720
are good enough.
 

1201
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,310
are good enough.
But now that I'm doing a generation

1202
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,320
But now that I'm doing a generation
 

1203
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,549
But now that I'm doing a generation
task, I need to choose something to

1204
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
task, I need to choose something to
 

1205
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,909
task, I need to choose something to
actually feed in to the next layer,

1206
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:19,919
actually feed in to the next layer,
 

1207
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,909
actually feed in to the next layer,
right? I can say, well, there's 50%

1208
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:21,919
right? I can say, well, there's 50%
 

1209
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,510
right? I can say, well, there's 50%
probability of this and 30% probability

1210
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
probability of this and 30% probability
 

1211
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,070
probability of this and 30% probability
of this and 20% probability of this.

1212
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
of this and 20% probability of this.
 

1213
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,870
of this and 20% probability of this.
That doesn't get me a translation. That

1214
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:28,880
That doesn't get me a translation. That
 

1215
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,029
That doesn't get me a translation. That
just gets me like some distribution of

1216
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:31,039
just gets me like some distribution of
 

1217
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,909
just gets me like some distribution of
words. So to generate the next token, I

1218
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:33,919
words. So to generate the next token, I
 

1219
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,390
words. So to generate the next token, I
need to choose one of these words. And

1220
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:36,400
need to choose one of these words. And
 

1221
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:43,990
need to choose one of these words. And
so what I need to do is I need to sample

1222
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,000

 

1223
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,750

Ah, so how do I sample? There's many

1224
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:45,760
Ah, so how do I sample? There's many
 

1225
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,950
Ah, so how do I sample? There's many
different ways to sample, right? So

1226
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
different ways to sample, right? So
 

1227
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,549
different ways to sample, right? So
let's say I have different tokens. So

1228
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:48,559
let's say I have different tokens. So
 

1229
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,870
let's say I have different tokens. So
how do I sample? Let's uh

1230
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:52,880
how do I sample? Let's uh
 

1231
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,909
how do I sample? Let's uh
let me

1232
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919

 

1233
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,070

so let me

1234
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
so let me
 

1235
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,430
so let me
sampling

1236
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:07,440

 

1237
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,190

what I have here.

1238
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
what I have here.
 

1239
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:22,870
what I have here.
is probabilities.

1240
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:22,880

 

1241
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,789

So, let's say I have um

1242
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799
So, let's say I have um
 

1243
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,389
So, let's say I have um
y1

1244
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:28,399
y1
 

1245
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,070
y1
with 50%.

1246
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,080
with 50%.
 

1247
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,110
with 50%.
Uh I don't like this y subscript.

1248
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
Uh I don't like this y subscript.
 

1249
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,789
Uh I don't like this y subscript.
Let's say I just have um

1250
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799

 

1251
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:50,149

let me just use this example

1252
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:50,159

 

1253
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,470

in harchy. This would be

1254
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480

 

1255
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,830

okay. So this is word

1256
00:28:59,830 --> 00:28:59,840
okay. So this is word
 

1257
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,110
okay. So this is word
one, two, three, four.

1258
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,120
one, two, three, four.
 

1259
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,430
one, two, three, four.
This is one, two, three. So now I put in

1260
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
This is one, two, three. So now I put in
 

1261
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,710
This is one, two, three. So now I put in
my start token to my decoder.

1262
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720

 

1263
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,870

It goes into my decoder and it produces

1264
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:18,880
It goes into my decoder and it produces
 

1265
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,110
It goes into my decoder and it produces
something. And now it has produced what

1266
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
something. And now it has produced what
 

1267
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,149
something. And now it has produced what
this produces here is it produces let's

1268
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
this produces here is it produces let's
 

1269
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,830
this produces here is it produces let's
say

1270
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:25,840
say
 

1271
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,190
say
uh

1272
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200

 

1273
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,669

let's say this is 50%.

1274
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
let's say this is 50%.
 

1275
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,350
let's say this is 50%.
and then uh

1276
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
and then uh
 

1277
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,470
and then uh
with some 60%

1278
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:38,480
with some 60%
 

1279
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,310
with some 60%
and I don't know whatever else produces

1280
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
and I don't know whatever else produces
 

1281
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,590
and I don't know whatever else produces
different it can't produce this with

1282
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:41,600
different it can't produce this with
 

1283
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,269
different it can't produce this with
60%. It produces this with 20%. Okay, so

1284
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
60%. It produces this with 20%. Okay, so
 

1285
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,230
60%. It produces this with 20%. Okay, so
it produces some words.

1286
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
it produces some words.
 

1287
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,230
it produces some words.
Now I need to be able to take all of

1288
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,240
Now I need to be able to take all of
 

1289
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,630
Now I need to be able to take all of
this

1290
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:54,640

 

1291
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,630

and actually generate something that I

1292
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
and actually generate something that I
 

1293
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,909
and actually generate something that I
can feed in to the next layer,

1294
00:29:59,909 --> 00:29:59,919
can feed in to the next layer,
 

1295
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,430
can feed in to the next layer,
right?

1296
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:01,440
right?
 

1297
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,710
right?
How do I do that? I basically need to

1298
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
How do I do that? I basically need to
 

1299
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,630
How do I do that? I basically need to
sample from this distribution this

1300
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
sample from this distribution this
 

1301
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,350
sample from this distribution this
discrete this distribution um that is on

1302
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,360
discrete this distribution um that is on
 

1303
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,310
discrete this distribution um that is on
these words that have been generated. So

1304
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,320
these words that have been generated. So
 

1305
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,470
these words that have been generated. So
how can I do that? Well, one way is to

1306
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,480
how can I do that? Well, one way is to
 

1307
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,789
how can I do that? Well, one way is to
be greedy and say I'm always going to

1308
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799
be greedy and say I'm always going to
 

1309
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:17,990
be greedy and say I'm always going to
choose the thing with the maximum

1310
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
choose the thing with the maximum
 

1311
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,710
choose the thing with the maximum
probability. It turns out in practice

1312
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:20,720
probability. It turns out in practice
 

1313
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,630
probability. It turns out in practice
that that doesn't work as well and some

1314
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
that that doesn't work as well and some
 

1315
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,510
that that doesn't work as well and some
amount of randomness actually helps you.

1316
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:27,520

 

1317
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,750

Does that make sense?

1318
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:33,760

 

1319
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,149

How do you So, so basically I I I So

1320
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:36,159
How do you So, so basically I I I So
 

1321
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,310
How do you So, so basically I I I So
what do I say? I I don't add a

1322
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,320
what do I say? I I don't add a
 

1323
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,990
what do I say? I I don't add a
randomness. I say like look here here's

1324
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,000
randomness. I say like look here here's
 

1325
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,430
randomness. I say like look here here's
my distribution and I literally draw a

1326
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:41,440
my distribution and I literally draw a
 

1327
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,310
my distribution and I literally draw a
sample from it. So I I I I roll a

1328
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,320
sample from it. So I I I I roll a
 

1329
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,470
sample from it. So I I I I roll a
dieice.

1330
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:48,480

 

1331
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,909

Yeah, I'm just sampling from that

1332
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:49,919
Yeah, I'm just sampling from that
 

1333
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,110
Yeah, I'm just sampling from that
distribution. Right. This what what I

1334
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,120
distribution. Right. This what what I
 

1335
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,870
distribution. Right. This what what I
get as the output is a distribution on

1336
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:52,880
get as the output is a distribution on
 

1337
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,230
get as the output is a distribution on
my output uh token tokens.

1338
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240

 

1339
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,230

reason why

1340
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:00,240
reason why
 

1341
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,510
reason why
brand sampling is working but the

1342
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:03,520
brand sampling is working but the
 

1343
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,310
brand sampling is working but the
highest probability might not work

1344
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:06,320
highest probability might not work
 

1345
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,310
highest probability might not work
sometimes because you know you're just

1346
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
sometimes because you know you're just
 

1347
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,789
sometimes because you know you're just
uh it's just the nature of the data that

1348
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:10,799
uh it's just the nature of the data that
 

1349
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,630
uh it's just the nature of the data that
like you might not uh

1350
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,640
like you might not uh
 

1351
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,110
like you might not uh
have

1352
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,120
have
 

1353
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,269
have
yeah just I guess there's no I don't

1354
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:19,279
yeah just I guess there's no I don't
 

1355
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,269
yeah just I guess there's no I don't
have a rigorous explanation for you

1356
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
have a rigorous explanation for you
 

1357
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,710
have a rigorous explanation for you
because it's just an observational thing

1358
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:22,720
because it's just an observational thing
 

1359
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,789
because it's just an observational thing
there's no proof of why this is better

1360
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799
there's no proof of why this is better
 

1361
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,070
there's no proof of why this is better
one might think that if you were doing

1362
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,080
one might think that if you were doing
 

1363
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,590
one might think that if you were doing
some kind of maximum likelihood do

1364
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:27,600
some kind of maximum likelihood do
 

1365
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,830
some kind of maximum likelihood do
coding and if if you know in some kind

1366
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840
coding and if if you know in some kind
 

1367
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,190
coding and if if you know in some kind
of uh uh

1368
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,200
of uh uh
 

1369
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,549
of uh uh
probabilistic sense you wanted to have

1370
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:34,559
probabilistic sense you wanted to have
 

1371
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,750
probabilistic sense you wanted to have
the best thing well you have all these

1372
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:35,760
the best thing well you have all these
 

1373
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,509
the best thing well you have all these
rules right you can have the best match

1374
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:37,519
rules right you can have the best match
 

1375
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,669
rules right you can have the best match
be you have the maximum likelihood rule

1376
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679
be you have the maximum likelihood rule
 

1377
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,830
be you have the maximum likelihood rule
or the maximum a posterior rule you can

1378
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:41,840
or the maximum a posterior rule you can
 

1379
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,110
or the maximum a posterior rule you can
do all of these different kinds of rules

1380
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
do all of these different kinds of rules
 

1381
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,350
do all of these different kinds of rules
and those those are provably best in the

1382
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,360
and those those are provably best in the
 

1383
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,029
and those those are provably best in the
sense of some kind of metric often

1384
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:49,039
sense of some kind of metric often
 

1385
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,430
sense of some kind of metric often
squared loss but here it's language and

1386
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,440
squared loss but here it's language and
 

1387
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,870
squared loss but here it's language and
squared loss or these metrics they're

1388
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:54,880
squared loss or these metrics they're
 

1389
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,310
squared loss or these metrics they're
they're just mathematical notions and

1390
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,320
they're just mathematical notions and
 

1391
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,909
they're just mathematical notions and
somehow those are not what is best for

1392
00:31:57,909 --> 00:31:57,919
somehow those are not what is best for
 

1393
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,909
somehow those are not what is best for
language. So I there's there's no way to

1394
00:31:59,909 --> 00:31:59,919
language. So I there's there's no way to
 

1395
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,310
language. So I there's there's no way to
prove to you that randomness is better.

1396
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,320
prove to you that randomness is better.
 

1397
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,590
prove to you that randomness is better.
It's just that that's what's observed in

1398
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:03,600
It's just that that's what's observed in
 

1399
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,430
It's just that that's what's observed in
practice. And so what you might observe

1400
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,440
practice. And so what you might observe
 

1401
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,870
practice. And so what you might observe
is like if you've played with these

1402
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
is like if you've played with these
 

1403
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,990
is like if you've played with these
things, you have this temperature

1404
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,000
things, you have this temperature
 

1405
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,110
things, you have this temperature
parameter and you can set the

1406
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,120
parameter and you can set the
 

1407
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,470
parameter and you can set the
temperature to zero. You can set the

1408
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,480
temperature to zero. You can set the
 

1409
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,750
temperature to zero. You can set the
temperature to be high. The higher the

1410
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,760
temperature to be high. The higher the
 

1411
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,110
temperature to be high. The higher the
temperature is, the more the randomness

1412
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:13,120
temperature is, the more the randomness
 

1413
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,509
temperature is, the more the randomness
is in what you're generating. The lower

1414
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:15,519
is in what you're generating. The lower
 

1415
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,149
is in what you're generating. The lower
the temperature is then the more uh

1416
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:18,159
the temperature is then the more uh
 

1417
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,230
the temperature is then the more uh
you're close you closer you are to just

1418
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,240
you're close you closer you are to just
 

1419
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,830
you're close you closer you are to just
choosing the most likely output.

1420
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:23,840
choosing the most likely output.
 

1421
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,909
choosing the most likely output.

00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:10,480
there's recent work on this trying to do
 

1591
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,109
there's recent work on this trying to do
this thinking in continuous token space

1592
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:13,119
this thinking in continuous token space
 

1593
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,870
this thinking in continuous token space
where they did stuff like this. So

1594
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:14,880
where they did stuff like this. So
 

1595
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,710
where they did stuff like this. So
people have explored it. They claimed

1596
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:16,720
people have explored it. They claimed
 

1597
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,470
people have explored it. They claimed
good results. Other people replications

1598
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:18,480
good results. Other people replications
 

1599
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,030
good results. Other people replications
were kind of fishy. So it's not clear

1600
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,040
were kind of fishy. So it's not clear
 

1601
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,109
were kind of fishy. So it's not clear
how much benefit it's actually giving.

1602
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:23,119
how much benefit it's actually giving.
 

1603
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,190
how much benefit it's actually giving.
It's like a

1604
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200

 

1605
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,190

>> Okay,

1606
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,200
>> Okay,
 

1607
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,589
>> Okay,
good. Anyways, this this is like not the

1608
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:33,599
good. Anyways, this this is like not the
 

1609
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,589
good. Anyways, this this is like not the
focus of the lecture, but let's move on.

1610
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:37,599
focus of the lecture, but let's move on.
 

1611
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,950
focus of the lecture, but let's move on.
Okay. So, what we want to do now is we

1612
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
Okay. So, what we want to do now is we
 

1613
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,470
Okay. So, what we want to do now is we
want to be able to talk about um how do

1614
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:44,480
want to be able to talk about um how do
 

1615
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,910
want to be able to talk about um how do
we handle this bottleneck. Okay.

1616
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:47,920
we handle this bottleneck. Okay.
 

1617
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,910
we handle this bottleneck. Okay.
And you've seen a bottleneck like this

1618
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:49,920
And you've seen a bottleneck like this
 

1619
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,470
And you've seen a bottleneck like this
before in one of our architectures. What

1620
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:52,480
before in one of our architectures. What
 

1621
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,390
before in one of our architectures. What
was where did we see this kind of

1622
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,400
was where did we see this kind of
 

1623
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,630
was where did we see this kind of
bottleneck in one sense? Come back to

1624
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640
bottleneck in one sense? Come back to
 

1625
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,510
bottleneck in one sense? Come back to
things that we've seen before. So, when

1626
00:35:59,510 --> 00:35:59,520
things that we've seen before. So, when
 

1627
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,230
things that we've seen before. So, when
we looked at units, right? What did we

1628
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,240
we looked at units, right? What did we
 

1629
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,109
we looked at units, right? What did we
have in units? Well, we had a

1630
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:05,119
have in units? Well, we had a
 

1631
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,750
have in units? Well, we had a
convolutional neural net and it's

1632
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:07,760
convolutional neural net and it's
 

1633
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,430
convolutional neural net and it's
basically downsampling, downsampling,

1634
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:09,440
basically downsampling, downsampling,
 

1635
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,430
basically downsampling, downsampling,
downsampling, and then upsampling,

1636
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:11,440
downsampling, and then upsampling,
 

1637
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,510
downsampling, and then upsampling,
upsampling, upsampling, and you you

1638
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:13,520
upsampling, upsampling, and you you
 

1639
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,870
upsampling, upsampling, and you you
brought everything down to this one

1640
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:14,880
brought everything down to this one
 

1641
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,270
brought everything down to this one
pixel, right? And you had it had many,

1642
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,280
pixel, right? And you had it had many,
 

1643
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,790
pixel, right? And you had it had many,
many channels, but it was just one

1644
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:18,800
many channels, but it was just one
 

1645
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,589
many channels, but it was just one
pixel. And that was what was responsible

1646
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:21,599
pixel. And that was what was responsible
 

1647
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,829
pixel. And that was what was responsible
for sending the information to the rest

1648
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:23,839
for sending the information to the rest
 

1649
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,150
for sending the information to the rest
of the future layers. Everyone remember

1650
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
of the future layers. Everyone remember
 

1651
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,829
of the future layers. Everyone remember
this in units like you're and let's say

1652
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:27,839
this in units like you're and let's say
 

1653
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,349
this in units like you're and let's say
you're trying to do some task like image

1654
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:29,359
you're trying to do some task like image
 

1655
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,790
you're trying to do some task like image
segmentation, right? So you need to look

1656
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
segmentation, right? So you need to look
 

1657
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,829
segmentation, right? So you need to look
at the whole image to understand well

1658
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:33,839
at the whole image to understand well
 

1659
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,430
at the whole image to understand well
where like maybe the segmentation you

1660
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:35,440
where like maybe the segmentation you
 

1661
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,589
where like maybe the segmentation you
want to segment the dog okay you want to

1662
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:37,599
want to segment the dog okay you want to
 

1663
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,790
want to segment the dog okay you want to
label something as a dog you want to

1664
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:38,800
label something as a dog you want to
 

1665
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,990
label something as a dog you want to
label something as a tree so you have to

1666
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
label something as a tree so you have to
 

1667
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,069
label something as a tree so you have to
look at the whole image

1668
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:42,079
look at the whole image
 

1669
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,990
look at the whole image
and then in your unit you're saying okay

1670
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,000
and then in your unit you're saying okay
 

1671
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,150
and then in your unit you're saying okay
I' I've now process process process

1672
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,160
I' I've now process process process
 

1673
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,829
I' I've now process process process
process process I've identified that in

1674
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:47,839
process process I've identified that in
 

1675
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,630
process process I've identified that in
this picture there is actually a dog and

1676
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:50,640
this picture there is actually a dog and
 

1677
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,470
this picture there is actually a dog and
now what I want to do is I want to be

1678
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:52,480
now what I want to do is I want to be
 

1679
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,510
now what I want to do is I want to be
able to draw the boundary of the dog and

1680
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,520
able to draw the boundary of the dog and
 

1681
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,230
able to draw the boundary of the dog and
so I'm blowing my image back up to draw

1682
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,240
so I'm blowing my image back up to draw
 

1683
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,990
so I'm blowing my image back up to draw
the boundary of the dog and understand

1684
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
the boundary of the dog and understand
 

1685
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,870
the boundary of the dog and understand
where is the dog ear and where is the

1686
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:02,880
where is the dog ear and where is the
 

1687
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,430
where is the dog ear and where is the
sky that is behind the dog ear. I need

1688
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,440
sky that is behind the dog ear. I need
 

1689
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,710
sky that is behind the dog ear. I need
to look at the neighboring pixels,

1690
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:06,720
to look at the neighboring pixels,
 

1691
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,390
to look at the neighboring pixels,
right? I it's not enough for me to just

1692
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
right? I it's not enough for me to just
 

1693
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,550
right? I it's not enough for me to just
say that this entire image has a dog in

1694
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:10,560
say that this entire image has a dog in
 

1695
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,349
say that this entire image has a dog in
it. I need to now look at it again on a

1696
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:13,359
it. I need to now look at it again on a
 

1697
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,030
it. I need to now look at it again on a
pixel by pixel basis. So I'm blowing

1698
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,040
pixel by pixel basis. So I'm blowing
 

1699
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,030
pixel by pixel basis. So I'm blowing
this back up.

1700
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,040
this back up.
 

1701
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,710
this back up.
And what was the thing that we did in

1702
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:18,720
And what was the thing that we did in
 

1703
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,510
And what was the thing that we did in
units to get around this problem? we had

1704
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
units to get around this problem? we had
 

1705
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,510
units to get around this problem? we had
basically let it said that okay now I'

1706
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:25,520
basically let it said that okay now I'
 

1707
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,270
basically let it said that okay now I'
I've come down to this small resolution

1708
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,280
I've come down to this small resolution
 

1709
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,990
I've come down to this small resolution
and now I'm blowing back up so let me

1710
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,000
and now I'm blowing back up so let me
 

1711
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,710
and now I'm blowing back up so let me
look back at the last time I was the

1712
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:34,720
look back at the last time I was the
 

1713
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,790
look back at the last time I was the
same size right so I I'm and maybe

1714
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:38,800
same size right so I I'm and maybe
 

1715
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,829
same size right so I I'm and maybe
there's relevant context there and so

1716
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:41,839
there's relevant context there and so
 

1717
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,109
there's relevant context there and so
you know I look at where I am currently

1718
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:45,119
you know I look at where I am currently
 

1719
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,349
you know I look at where I am currently
and I go back and I say let me look at

1720
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:47,359
and I go back and I say let me look at
 

1721
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,190
and I go back and I say let me look at
the side at at the previous time I was

1722
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
the side at at the previous time I was
 

1723
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,030
the side at at the previous time I was
the same size and what were the

1724
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,040
the same size and what were the
 

1725
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,069
the same size and what were the
neighboring pixels around me

1726
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:54,079
neighboring pixels around me
 

1727
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,990
neighboring pixels around me
And then I blow up again and I say, "Let

1728
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,000
And then I blow up again and I say, "Let
 

1729
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,870
And then I blow up again and I say, "Let
me go and look back at where what was

1730
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
me go and look back at where what was
 

1731
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,190
me go and look back at where what was
what was the what were the pixels like

1732
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,200
what was the what were the pixels like
 

1733
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,109
what was the what were the pixels like
when I was the same size again?" And we

1734
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
when I was the same size again?" And we
 

1735
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,710
when I was the same size again?" And we
have these kind of going back

1736
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:04,720
have these kind of going back
 

1737
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,030
have these kind of going back
connections that help establish the

1738
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,040
connections that help establish the
 

1739
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,150
connections that help establish the
right context for each pixel. Everyone

1740
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,160
right context for each pixel. Everyone
 

1741
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,790
right context for each pixel. Everyone
remember this from from units?

1742
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:12,800
remember this from from units?
 

1743
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,310
remember this from from units?
So what I want to bring out is that

1744
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:14,320
So what I want to bring out is that
 

1745
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,670
So what I want to bring out is that
basically this is um this is the the

1746
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:19,680
basically this is um this is the the
 

1747
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,510
basically this is um this is the the
same kind of challenge. It's not the

1748
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,520
same kind of challenge. It's not the
 

1749
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,430
same kind of challenge. It's not the
same challenge, but it's the same nature

1750
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:23,440
same challenge, but it's the same nature
 

1751
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,069
same challenge, but it's the same nature
of challenge where you have a bottleneck

1752
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:26,079
of challenge where you have a bottleneck
 

1753
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,349
of challenge where you have a bottleneck
and you want to be able to pass a lot of

1754
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:29,359
and you want to be able to pass a lot of
 

1755
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,550
and you want to be able to pass a lot of
information through that bottleneck. So,

1756
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:30,560
information through that bottleneck. So,
 

1757
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,310
information through that bottleneck. So,
you want to be able to give maybe some

1758
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:32,320
you want to be able to give maybe some
 

1759
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,430
you want to be able to give maybe some
side information or something or maybe

1760
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:35,440
side information or something or maybe
 

1761
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,550
side information or something or maybe
you want to add connections back to the

1762
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:38,560
you want to add connections back to the
 

1763
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,310
you want to add connections back to the
appropriate places. Okay?

1764
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:42,320
appropriate places. Okay?
 

1765
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,349
appropriate places. Okay?
And in a unit

1766
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:45,359
And in a unit
 

1767
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,030
And in a unit
appropriate place was kind of natural,

1768
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,040
appropriate place was kind of natural,
 

1769
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,109
appropriate place was kind of natural,
right? Because you can think of an image

1770
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:51,119
right? Because you can think of an image
 

1771
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,829
right? Because you can think of an image
as you know you have every pixel has a

1772
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839
as you know you have every pixel has a
 

1773
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,990
as you know you have every pixel has a
position. It has an index in an array

1774
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
position. It has an index in an array
 

1775
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,630
position. It has an index in an array
and it's natural to say well let's look

1776
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:00,640
and it's natural to say well let's look
 

1777
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,950
and it's natural to say well let's look
at the exact same position right when I

1778
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:02,960
at the exact same position right when I
 

1779
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,109
at the exact same position right when I
was in the same size.

1780
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:05,119
was in the same size.
 

1781
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,589
was in the same size.
So this appropriate position is kind of

1782
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:07,599
So this appropriate position is kind of
 

1783
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,310
So this appropriate position is kind of
natural

1784
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:10,320
natural
 

1785
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,190
natural
but now we have this issue with language

1786
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:15,200
but now we have this issue with language
 

1787
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,550
but now we have this issue with language
and language is much more complicated.

1788
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560

 

1789
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,270

language is complicated because I mean

1790
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,280
language is complicated because I mean
 

1791
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,510
language is complicated because I mean
the word order is simply not the same

1792
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
the word order is simply not the same
 

1793
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,589
the word order is simply not the same
right and to be able to translate a

1794
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:27,599
right and to be able to translate a
 

1795
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,510
right and to be able to translate a
sentence I need to look at the entire

1796
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:29,520
sentence I need to look at the entire
 

1797
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,630
sentence I need to look at the entire
sentence sentences can be long

1798
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:32,640
sentence sentences can be long
 

1799
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,150
sentence sentences can be long
does everyone understand the challenge

1800
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,160
does everyone understand the challenge
 

1801
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,190
does everyone understand the challenge
here and why we can't just have like a

1802
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,200
here and why we can't just have like a
 

1803
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,910
here and why we can't just have like a
unit like connection that will we want

1804
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920
unit like connection that will we want
 

1805
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,990
unit like connection that will we want
to be inspired by units but just there's

1806
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,000
to be inspired by units but just there's
 

1807
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,589
to be inspired by units but just there's
no obvious way to just take the unit

1808
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:43,599
no obvious way to just take the unit
 

1809
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,829
no obvious way to just take the unit
idea and force it onto this Okay.

1810
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:47,839
idea and force it onto this Okay.
 

1811
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,990
idea and force it onto this Okay.
So the question is now what can we do?

1812
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,000
So the question is now what can we do?
 

1813
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,630
So the question is now what can we do?
So maybe take a couple of minutes and

1814
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:52,640
So maybe take a couple of minutes and
 

1815
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,230
So maybe take a couple of minutes and
just like think through this problem.

1816
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:54,240
just like think through this problem.
 

1817
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,750
just like think through this problem.
I'm going to give you that time. I'm

1818
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:55,760
I'm going to give you that time. I'm
 

1819
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,829
I'm going to give you that time. I'm
going to write some stuff about units on

1820
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
going to write some stuff about units on
 

1821
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,190
going to write some stuff about units on
my paper so that you all have notes

1822
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
my paper so that you all have notes
 

1823
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,550
my paper so that you all have notes
and

1824
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:04,560

 

1825
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:28,310

yeah.

1826
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:28,320

 

1827
00:40:28,320 --> 00:41:25,670

If I say

1828
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:25,680

 

1829
00:41:25,680 --> 00:42:23,349

Oh my god.

1830
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:23,359

 

1831
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,150

Okay.

1832
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,160

 

1833
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,630

So, we have this challenge, right? We

1834
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:30,640
So, we have this challenge, right? We
 

1835
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,270
So, we have this challenge, right? We
want to be able to be inspired by units.

1836
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,280
want to be able to be inspired by units.
 

1837
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,030
want to be able to be inspired by units.
But we have the problem that with

1838
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
But we have the problem that with
 

1839
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,349
But we have the problem that with
language and translation in particular,

1840
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:37,359
language and translation in particular,
 

1841
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,710
language and translation in particular,
it's not at all clear that

1842
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:40,720
it's not at all clear that
 

1843
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,750
it's not at all clear that
or it's not clear how we can define what

1844
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:43,760
or it's not clear how we can define what
 

1845
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,790
or it's not clear how we can define what
the appropriate position is, right?

1846
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:46,800
the appropriate position is, right?
 

1847
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,230
the appropriate position is, right?
Because things change places. Okay? So

1848
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:50,240
Because things change places. Okay? So
 

1849
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,270
Because things change places. Okay? So
our challenge is that

1850
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:55,280

 

1851
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,109

we cannot

1852
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:57,119
we cannot
 

1853
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,270
we cannot
set

1854
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,280
set
 

1855
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,470
set
a topology

1856
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:02,480
a topology
 

1857
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,670
a topology
of connections

1858
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:07,680

 

1859
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,950

in advance.

1860
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:10,960
in advance.
 

1861
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,030
in advance.
We need to somehow

1862
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,040
We need to somehow
 

1863
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,990
We need to somehow
this somehow will depend on the input

1864
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,000
this somehow will depend on the input
 

1865
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,910
this somehow will depend on the input
itself.

1866
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:17,920
itself.
 

1867
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,430
itself.
Okay.

1868
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:21,440

 

1869
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,150

So now we have to think about what kind

1870
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:24,160
So now we have to think about what kind
 

1871
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,910
So now we have to think about what kind
of data structures or what kind of

1872
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:27,920
of data structures or what kind of
 

1873
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,230
of data structures or what kind of
machinery do we have that can allow us

1874
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240
machinery do we have that can allow us
 

1875
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,829
machinery do we have that can allow us
to

1876
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
to
 

1877
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,950
to
take some input and find the relevant

1878
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:36,960
take some input and find the relevant
 

1879
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,710
take some input and find the relevant
positions

1880
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:38,720
positions
 

1881
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,750
positions
by computing something from that

1882
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:41,760
by computing something from that
 

1883
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,790
by computing something from that
input itself. Right? for a array the

1884
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:46,800
input itself. Right? for a array the
 

1885
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,510
input itself. Right? for a array the
relevant positions for a pixel are given

1886
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,520
relevant positions for a pixel are given
 

1887
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,155
relevant positions for a pixel are given
by the index of the pixel in the

1888
00:43:51,155 --> 00:43:51,165
by the index of the pixel in the
 

1889
00:43:51,165 --> 00:43:53,510
by the index of the pixel in the
[clears throat] array essentially right

1890
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
[clears throat] array essentially right
 

1891
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,910
[clears throat] array essentially right
and so I can just map and look that the

1892
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
and so I can just map and look that the
 

1893
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,910
and so I can just map and look that the
index is has all the information

1894
00:43:59,910 --> 00:43:59,920
index is has all the information
 

1895
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,230
index is has all the information
but what are other ways in which we can

1896
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:02,240
but what are other ways in which we can
 

1897
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,829
but what are other ways in which we can
do this kind of lookup this is something

1898
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:03,839
do this kind of lookup this is something
 

1899
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:11,510
do this kind of lookup this is something
that you've all seen before

1900
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:11,520

 

1901
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,670

so maybe take a minute to think

1902
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:13,680
so maybe take a minute to think
 

1903
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,430
so maybe take a minute to think
Just to give you an aside. So we were

1904
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,440
Just to give you an aside. So we were
 

1905
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,430
Just to give you an aside. So we were
just talking before coming to to coming

1906
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,440
just talking before coming to to coming
 

1907
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,510
just talking before coming to to coming
to lecture and one of the things that we

1908
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:19,520
to lecture and one of the things that we
 

1909
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,150
to lecture and one of the things that we
were talking about is the challenge of

1910
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,160
were talking about is the challenge of
 

1911
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,910
were talking about is the challenge of
keeping up in this field like we were

1912
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:23,920
keeping up in this field like we were
 

1913
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,630
keeping up in this field like we were
talking about just the rapid things like

1914
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:26,640
talking about just the rapid things like
 

1915
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,870
talking about just the rapid things like
I'm I'm reading the prince textbook for

1916
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:28,880
I'm I'm reading the prince textbook for
 

1917
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,630
I'm I'm reading the prince textbook for
example and some of the things that are

1918
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:30,640
example and some of the things that are
 

1919
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,030
example and some of the things that are
very nice or some of the most latest

1920
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,040
very nice or some of the most latest
 

1921
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,430
very nice or some of the most latest
advances are simply not in the textbook

1922
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:35,440
advances are simply not in the textbook
 

1923
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,069
advances are simply not in the textbook
or it's really it's really hard to find

1924
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:38,079
or it's really it's really hard to find
 

1925
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,670
or it's really it's really hard to find
current information because it's

1926
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:39,680
current information because it's
 

1927
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,349
current information because it's
changing so rapidly. And so what we're

1928
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:43,359
changing so rapidly. And so what we're
 

1929
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,950
changing so rapidly. And so what we're
going to try and do is we're going to

1930
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,960
going to try and do is we're going to
 

1931
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,630
going to try and do is we're going to
try and teach you in a sense the

1932
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,640
try and teach you in a sense the
 

1933
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,309
try and teach you in a sense the
historical

1934
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:50,319
historical
 

1935
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,390
historical
thought process. This is not really

1936
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:52,400
thought process. This is not really
 

1937
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,630
thought process. This is not really
written out

1938
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:54,640
written out
 

1939
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,750
written out
in many places or anywhere that and that

1940
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:57,760
in many places or anywhere that and that
 

1941
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,309
in many places or anywhere that and that
led to the design choices

1942
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:00,319
led to the design choices
 

1943
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,069
led to the design choices
that give us the architectures that we

1944
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:02,079
that give us the architectures that we
 

1945
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,670
that give us the architectures that we
have today. And so what I'm hoping is

1946
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:05,680
have today. And so what I'm hoping is
 

1947
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,710
have today. And so what I'm hoping is
that you will see this therefore as a as

1948
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:08,720
that you will see this therefore as a as
 

1949
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,349
that you will see this therefore as a as
an evolution of one thing after another

1950
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:11,359
an evolution of one thing after another
 

1951
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,510
an evolution of one thing after another
after another as opposed to this is one

1952
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:13,520
after another as opposed to this is one
 

1953
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,030
after another as opposed to this is one
thing and this is another thing and

1954
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:15,040
thing and this is another thing and
 

1955
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,109
thing and this is another thing and
these are not discrete silos that you

1956
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:17,119
these are not discrete silos that you
 

1957
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,309
these are not discrete silos that you
all have to memorize because that's not

1958
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:20,319
all have to memorize because that's not
 

1959
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,550
all have to memorize because that's not
an approach that is going to have you be

1960
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
an approach that is going to have you be
 

1961
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,309
an approach that is going to have you be
up to date in the way that you need to

1962
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:24,319
up to date in the way that you need to
 

1963
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,390
up to date in the way that you need to
be in this field. It's just insane,

1964
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:26,400
be in this field. It's just insane,
 

1965
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,230
be in this field. It's just insane,
right? like

1966
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:28,240
right? like
 

1967
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,030
right? like
uh and so

1968
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:31,040
uh and so
 

1969
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,190
uh and so
just trying to think through like this

1970
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,200
just trying to think through like this
 

1971
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,349
just trying to think through like this
process of why is for example attention

1972
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:35,359
process of why is for example attention
 

1973
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,550
process of why is for example attention
in this case an evolution of what we

1974
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:38,560
in this case an evolution of what we
 

1975
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,990
in this case an evolution of what we
were thinking or what the community was

1976
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,000
were thinking or what the community was
 

1977
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,870
were thinking or what the community was
thinking in RNN's is what we're trying

1978
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:42,880
thinking in RNN's is what we're trying
 

1979
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,510
thinking in RNN's is what we're trying
to trying to get you to see which is why

1980
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:45,520
to trying to get you to see which is why
 

1981
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,950
to trying to get you to see which is why
this lecture is being given the way it

1982
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:46,960
this lecture is being given the way it
 

1983
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,470
this lecture is being given the way it
is I could have just written a formula

1984
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
is I could have just written a formula
 

1985
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,710
is I could have just written a formula
for attention and then we'd be done with

1986
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:50,720
for attention and then we'd be done with
 

1987
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,710
for attention and then we'd be done with
the lecture

1988
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:52,720
the lecture
 

1989
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,230
the lecture
so that's why I want you to try and

1990
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,240
so that's why I want you to try and
 

1991
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,910
so that's why I want you to try and
think through this and have these

1992
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:55,920
think through this and have these
 

1993
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,910
think through this and have these
minutes.

1994
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:57,920
minutes.
 

1995
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,501
minutes.
Uh was there a question at the back?

1996
00:46:01,501 --> 00:46:01,511
Uh was there a question at the back?
 

1997
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:02,230
Uh was there a question at the back?

2000
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:07,040

 

2001
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,470

>> Yes.

2002
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:10,480

 

2003
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,230

>> Yes. So exactly we talked about this in

2004
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,240
>> Yes. So exactly we talked about this in
 

2005
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,390
>> Yes. So exactly we talked about this in
the context of GNN's and in one sense

2006
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
the context of GNN's and in one sense
 

2007
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,750
the context of GNN's and in one sense
that attention is you can think of as uh

2008
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:17,760
that attention is you can think of as uh
 

2009
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,190
that attention is you can think of as uh
a com like a or transformer network as a

2010
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:21,200
a com like a or transformer network as a
 

2011
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,829
a com like a or transformer network as a
GNN with a complete graph. Um, and so

2012
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:23,839
GNN with a complete graph. Um, and so
 

2013
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,349
GNN with a complete graph. Um, and so
we're we're going to get there, but I

2014
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:25,359
we're we're going to get there, but I
 

2015
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,349
we're we're going to get there, but I
want to get there a little bit slowly.

2016
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:27,359
want to get there a little bit slowly.
 

2017
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,670
want to get there a little bit slowly.
Uh, going a little bit step by step.

2018
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,680
Uh, going a little bit step by step.
 

2019
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,589
Uh, going a little bit step by step.
Okay.

2020
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:31,599
Okay.
 

2021
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,309
Okay.
So, the thing that I want to use instead

2022
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:34,319
So, the thing that I want to use instead
 

2023
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,470
So, the thing that I want to use instead
of an array with a lookup is I want to

2024
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:36,480
of an array with a lookup is I want to
 

2025
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,870
of an array with a lookup is I want to
use a hash table,

2026
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:38,880
use a hash table,
 

2027
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,790
use a hash table,
right? So, what I'm going to do is I'm

2028
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
right? So, what I'm going to do is I'm
 

2029
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,349
right? So, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say I have some input.

2030
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:45,359
going to say I have some input.
 

2031
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,589
going to say I have some input.
What does it match with? Right? I'm

2032
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:47,599
What does it match with? Right? I'm
 

2033
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,109
What does it match with? Right? I'm
going to look at the hash of it and I'm

2034
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:49,119
going to look at the hash of it and I'm
 

2035
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,349
going to look at the hash of it and I'm
going to see well, what is similar?

2036
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:51,359
going to see well, what is similar?
 

2037
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,349
going to see well, what is similar?
Okay, so that's the idea that we want to

2038
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:53,359
Okay, so that's the idea that we want to
 

2039
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,950
Okay, so that's the idea that we want to
use. We want to use something like a

2040
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:54,960
use. We want to use something like a
 

2041
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,390
use. We want to use something like a
hash table or a dictionary to understand

2042
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,400
hash table or a dictionary to understand
 

2043
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,030
hash table or a dictionary to understand
what the connection should be based on

2044
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,040
what the connection should be based on
 

2045
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,589
what the connection should be based on
the input. Does that make sense to

2046
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:03,599
the input. Does that make sense to
 

2047
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,910
the input. Does that make sense to
everyone?

2048
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:05,920
everyone?
 

2049
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,589
everyone?
Because we don't have this parallel that

2050
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:07,599
Because we don't have this parallel that
 

2051
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,270
Because we don't have this parallel that
we have in units of like oh we can just

2052
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
we have in units of like oh we can just
 

2053
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,750
we have in units of like oh we can just
look at the index question. I was

2054
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:11,760
look at the index question. I was
 

2055
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,589
look at the index question. I was
curious. I remember earlier on we also

2056
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:13,599
curious. I remember earlier on we also
 

2057
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,270
curious. I remember earlier on we also
talked about this idea of doing skip

2058
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,280
talked about this idea of doing skip
 

2059
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,190
talked about this idea of doing skip
connection just around an individual

2060
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,200
connection just around an individual
 

2061
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,430
connection just around an individual
block because then there's like a clear

2062
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,440
block because then there's like a clear
 

2063
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,430
block because then there's like a clear
path that the the gradients could kind

2064
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:21,440
path that the the gradients could kind
 

2065
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,069
path that the the gradients could kind
of follow.

2066
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:22,079
of follow.
 

2067
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:22,790
of follow.
>> Yeah,

2068
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:22,800
>> Yeah,
 

2069
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,349
>> Yeah,
>> I was wondering maybe whether that works

2070
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:25,359
>> I was wondering maybe whether that works
 

2071
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,309
>> I was wondering maybe whether that works
here or like I guess why that idea

2072
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,319
here or like I guess why that idea
 

2073
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,750
here or like I guess why that idea
wouldn't work where if I just have a

2074
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:29,760
wouldn't work where if I just have a
 

2075
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,790
wouldn't work where if I just have a
skip over my own block then I wouldn't

2076
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:32,800
skip over my own block then I wouldn't
 

2077
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,309
skip over my own block then I wouldn't
be able to just kind of put those end to

2078
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,319
be able to just kind of put those end to
 

2079
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,190
be able to just kind of put those end to
end and let the gradients flow smoothly

2080
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:37,200
end and let the gradients flow smoothly
 

2081
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,630
end and let the gradients flow smoothly
as far as they need to go. So I'm I

2082
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:40,640
as far as they need to go. So I'm I
 

2083
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,829
as far as they need to go. So I'm I
think I'm not understanding your

2084
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:41,839
think I'm not understanding your
 

2085
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,750
think I'm not understanding your
question. So this like in these RN

2086
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:43,760
question. So this like in these RN
 

2087
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,190
question. So this like in these RN
networks there will be residual

2088
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:45,200
networks there will be residual
 

2089
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,790
networks there will be residual
connections we have that that's not what

2090
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:48,800
connections we have that that's not what
 

2091
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,630
connections we have that that's not what
we're

2092
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640
we're
 

2093
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,550
we're
uh trying to think about. So what we're

2094
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:54,560
uh trying to think about. So what we're
 

2095
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,109
uh trying to think about. So what we're
what we're thinking about is when I'm

2096
00:47:57,109 --> 00:47:57,119
what we're thinking about is when I'm
 

2097
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,270
what we're thinking about is when I'm
looking at a input sentence right I want

2098
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:01,280
looking at a input sentence right I want
 

2099
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,109
looking at a input sentence right I want
to be able to so like here

2100
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:03,119
to be able to so like here
 

2101
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,670
to be able to so like here
>> you want a super high

2102
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680
>> you want a super high
 

2103

2107
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,870

gradient superighway and the residual
 

2109
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,349
gradient superighway and the residual
connections are important but they are

2110
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:13,359
connections are important but they are
 

2111
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,349
connections are important but they are
for a different reason. They're trying

00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:15,359
for a different reason. They're trying
 

2113

00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
problem that I am trying to solve right
 

2117
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,750
problem that I am trying to solve right
now is this bottleneck here

2118
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760
now is this bottleneck here
 

2119
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,109
now is this bottleneck here
which is when I'm putting in a long

2120
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:27,119
which is when I'm putting in a long
 

2121
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,230
which is when I'm putting in a long
sentence I'm not increasing the layers.

2122
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:30,240
sentence I'm not increasing the layers.
 

2123
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,870
sentence I'm not increasing the layers.
This is not about the layers here.

2124
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:32,880
This is not about the layers here.
 

2125
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,030
This is not about the layers here.
Right? The gradient superighways help me

2126
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:35,040
Right? The gradient superighways help me
 

2127
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,030
Right? The gradient superighways help me
here. These are I do have these residual

2128
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,040
here. These are I do have these residual
 

2129
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,030
here. These are I do have these residual
connections here,

2130
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,040
connections here,
 

2131
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,990
connections here,
but this is in the time direction in

2132
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,000
but this is in the time direction in
 

2133
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,750
but this is in the time direction in
some sense.

2134
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:43,760
some sense.
 

2135
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,829
some sense.
And so I all I have here is an RNN. It's

2136
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:47,839
And so I all I have here is an RNN. It's
 

2137
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,270
And so I all I have here is an RNN. It's
something like this. There's no there's

00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:49,280
something like this. There's no there's
 

2139
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,430
something like this. There's no there's
no way to put these super highways in a

00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:51,440
no way to put these super highways in a

2147
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,549

Does that

00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:02,559
Does that

2171
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,630
encode everything in just one hidden
state? We want don't want to encode

2172
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:30,640

2173

everything in just one hidden state
 

2175
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,950
everything in just one hidden state
because that's a lot of stuff and not a

2176
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:34,960
because that's a lot of stuff and not a
 

2177
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,710
because that's a lot of stuff and not a
lot of state

2178
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:36,720
lot of state
 

2179
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,630
lot of state
and if we made the state really big then

2180
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,640
and if we made the state really big then
 

2181
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,309
and if we made the state really big then
everything is a nightmare to train.

2182
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:44,319

 

2183
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,270

Okay. So this bottleneck this thing this

2184
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:47,280
Okay. So this bottleneck this thing this
 

2185
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,510
Okay. So this bottleneck this thing this
bottleneck is the key thing and the

2186
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,520
bottleneck is the key thing and the
 

2187
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,270
bottleneck is the key thing and the
bottleneck on that is the dimension of

2188
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:51,280
bottleneck on that is the dimension of
 

2189
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,390
bottleneck on that is the dimension of
the state in here and that can only be

2190
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,400
the state in here and that can only be
 

2191
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:01,349
the state in here and that can only be
so big.

2192
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:01,359

 

2193
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:08,230

Okay.

2194
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:08,240

 

2195
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,150

So what we're going to do is we want to

2196
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:10,160
So what we're going to do is we want to
 

2197
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,510
So what we're going to do is we want to
use our solution

2198
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:15,520

 

2199
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,910

is to use a hash table.

2200
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:21,920

 

2201
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,510

And we want to have some nice properties

2202
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:23,520
And we want to have some nice properties
 

2203
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,390
And we want to have some nice properties
of this hash table, right? Like in most

2204
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400
of this hash table, right? Like in most
 

2205
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,870
of this hash table, right? Like in most
specifically, if I told you, oh, come up

2206
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:28,880
specifically, if I told you, oh, come up
 

2207
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,190
specifically, if I told you, oh, come up
with a hasht to help with English to

2208
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:31,200
with a hasht to help with English to
 

2209
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,430
with a hasht to help with English to
Chinese translation. What's your best

2210
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:33,440
Chinese translation. What's your best
 

2211
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,510
Chinese translation. What's your best
guess of how to come up with that hasht?

2212
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:35,520
guess of how to come up with that hasht?
 

2213
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,710
guess of how to come up with that hasht?
Why don't you just do it right now? It's

2214
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:36,720
Why don't you just do it right now? It's
 

2215
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,349
Why don't you just do it right now? It's
a quick exercise.

2216
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:41,359

 

2217
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,109

You have obviously no idea how to come

2218
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:43,119
You have obviously no idea how to come
 

2219
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,790
You have obviously no idea how to come
up with this appropriate hash table so

2220
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:44,800
up with this appropriate hash table so
 

2221
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,710
up with this appropriate hash table so
that you can, you know, hash the Chinese

2222
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:46,720
that you can, you know, hash the Chinese
 

2223
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,150
that you can, you know, hash the Chinese
words to the appropriate place and the

2224
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:48,160
words to the appropriate place and the
 

2225
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,750
words to the appropriate place and the
English words in the appropriate way.

2226
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:49,760
English words in the appropriate way.
 

2227
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,309
English words in the appropriate way.
So, what's your solution?

2228
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319
So, what's your solution?
 

2229
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,670
So, what's your solution?
>> We're going to make it learnable, right?

2230
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:53,680
>> We're going to make it learnable, right?
 

2231
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,349
>> We're going to make it learnable, right?
It's like our basic we have one trick in

2232
00:50:55,349 --> 00:50:55,359
It's like our basic we have one trick in
 

2233
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,230
It's like our basic we have one trick in
this class make it learnable and so we

2234
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
this class make it learnable and so we
 

2235
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,750
this class make it learnable and so we
want something we want need to have a

2236
00:50:59,750 --> 00:50:59,760
want something we want need to have a
 

2237
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,270
want something we want need to have a
hash table that somehow we can learn it

2238
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:03,280
hash table that somehow we can learn it
 

2239
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,589
hash table that somehow we can learn it
needs to be uh differentiable it has to

2240
00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:05,599
needs to be uh differentiable it has to
 

2241
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,829
needs to be uh differentiable it has to
have something that we can uh pass

2242
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:07,839
have something that we can uh pass
 

2243
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,630
have something that we can uh pass
gradients through right so and so this

2244
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:10,640
gradients through right so and so this
 

2245
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:24,390
gradients through right so and so this
is a need basically need this.

2246
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:24,400

 

2247
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,990

Okay.

2248
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,000
Okay.
 

2249
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,069
Okay.
So,

2250
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:28,079
So,
 

2251
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,549
So,
let's think about how to do this. And

2252
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:30,559
let's think about how to do this. And
 

2253
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:37,190
let's think about how to do this. And
let me start with

2254
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:37,200

 

2255
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,030

idea. Let's call this idea minus one.

2256
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,040
idea. Let's call this idea minus one.
 

2257
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,030
idea. Let's call this idea minus one.
Okay.

2258
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040

 

2259
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,630

We're going to say let us look

2260
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:48,640
We're going to say let us look
 

2261
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,309
We're going to say let us look
for

2262
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:50,319
for
 

2263
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:55,860
for
the exact match

2264
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:55,870

00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:21,119

 

2285
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,589

corresponding

2286
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:25,599

 

2287
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,829

to exact

2288
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:27,839
to exact
 

2289
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,990
to exact
match.

2290
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,000
match.
 

2291
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,030
match.
So I'm going to use the query. So so in

2292
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:33,040
So I'm going to use the query. So so in
 

2293
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,109
So I'm going to use the query. So so in
a hash table um we have keys and we have

2294
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:37,119
a hash table um we have keys and we have
 

2295
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,990
a hash table um we have keys and we have
values, right? The keys tell us the key

2296
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,000
values, right? The keys tell us the key
 

2297
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,309
values, right? The keys tell us the key
the keys correspond to the input and

2298
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:42,319
the keys correspond to the input and
 

2299
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,470
the keys correspond to the input and
they tell us where the value is stored,

2300
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:44,480
they tell us where the value is stored,
 

2301
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,670
they tell us where the value is stored,
right? And then we can go and look up

2302
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:45,680
right? And then we can go and look up
 

2303
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,870
right? And then we can go and look up
the key and we retrieve the value.

2304
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:46,880
the key and we retrieve the value.
 

2305
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,510
the key and we retrieve the value.
That's how a hash table basically works.

2306
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:49,520
That's how a hash table basically works.
 

2307
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,870
That's how a hash table basically works.
Here we're going to think about queries,

2308
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:52,880
Here we're going to think about queries,
 

2309
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,150
Here we're going to think about queries,
keys and values. And what the queries

2310
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:56,160
keys and values. And what the queries
 

2311
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,630
keys and values. And what the queries
are, we're saying, well, I'm a word. I'm

2312
00:52:58,630 --> 00:52:58,640
are, we're saying, well, I'm a word. I'm
 

2313
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,790
are, we're saying, well, I'm a word. I'm
walking along. I'm a Chinese word. I'm

2314
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:00,800
walking along. I'm a Chinese word. I'm
 

2315
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,710
walking along. I'm a Chinese word. I'm
doing an English to Chinese translation.

2316
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:02,720
doing an English to Chinese translation.
 

2317
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,870
doing an English to Chinese translation.
I need to know where I should pay

2318
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:04,880
I need to know where I should pay
 

2319
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,950
I need to know where I should pay
attention to. what is the relevant

2320
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:06,960
attention to. what is the relevant
 

2321
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,670
attention to. what is the relevant
context for me? Okay, so I am the query

2322
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:11,680
context for me? Okay, so I am the query
 

2323
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,589
context for me? Okay, so I am the query
in some sense. I need to compare myself

2324
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:15,599
in some sense. I need to compare myself
 

2325
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,030
in some sense. I need to compare myself
to the keys that have come before me or

2326
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:19,040
to the keys that have come before me or
 

2327
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,670
to the keys that have come before me or
the keys maybe in the input sentence.

2328
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:21,680
the keys maybe in the input sentence.
 

2329
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,230
the keys maybe in the input sentence.
The keys are generated from those words

2330
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:24,240
The keys are generated from those words
 

2331
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,109
The keys are generated from those words
and I need to find out well which ones

2332
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:27,119
and I need to find out well which ones
 

2333
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,790
and I need to find out well which ones
are relevant for me, which ones are good

2334
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:28,800
are relevant for me, which ones are good
 

2335
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,069
are relevant for me, which ones are good
context and which ones are less

2336
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:30,079
context and which ones are less
 

2337
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,910
context and which ones are less
relevant. Okay, so this query, key and

2338
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:33,920
relevant. Okay, so this query, key and
 

2339
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,589
relevant. Okay, so this query, key and
value are the three things that you have

2340
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:35,599
value are the three things that you have
 

2341
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,069
value are the three things that you have
to think about. Okay,

2342
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079
to think about. Okay,
 

2343
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,870
to think about. Okay,
queries are related to the question who

2344
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
queries are related to the question who
 

2345
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,309
queries are related to the question who
should I pay attention to? I am the

2346
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:42,319
should I pay attention to? I am the
 

2347
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,390
should I pay attention to? I am the
query if I'm thinking about that. Keys

2348
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:44,400
query if I'm thinking about that. Keys
 

2349
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,589
query if I'm thinking about that. Keys
are what is there already that I need to

2350
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:47,599
are what is there already that I need to
 

2351
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,790
are what is there already that I need to
look up? And the value is saying, well,

2352
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
look up? And the value is saying, well,
 

2353
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,790
look up? And the value is saying, well,
if you pair these things together, what

2354
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800
if you pair these things together, what
 

2355
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,349
if you pair these things together, what
is the it's just the I don't know. I

2356
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:55,359
is the it's just the I don't know. I
 

2357
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,109
is the it's just the I don't know. I
can't it's just the value. I don't have

2358
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:57,119
can't it's just the value. I don't have
 

2359
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,630
can't it's just the value. I don't have
a better word for value. Okay, so I'm

2360
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:00,640
a better word for value. Okay, so I'm
 

2361
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,030
a better word for value. Okay, so I'm
calling this idea minus one and I'm

2362
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,040
calling this idea minus one and I'm
 

2363
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,549
calling this idea minus one and I'm
calling it idea minus one because it

2364
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:04,559
calling it idea minus one because it
 

2365
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:10,069
calling it idea minus one because it
doesn't work. So why doesn't this

2366
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
doesn't work. So why doesn't this
 

2367
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,470
doesn't work. So why doesn't this
this idea work, right?

2368
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:14,480

 

2369
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,990

Yeah. Or actually maybe we should give

2370
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:16,000
Yeah. Or actually maybe we should give
 

2371
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,270
Yeah. Or actually maybe we should give
everyone like a minute to think about

2372
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:17,280
everyone like a minute to think about
 

2373
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,430
everyone like a minute to think about
it. So take take one minute and that way

2374
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:19,440
it. So take take one minute and that way
 

2375
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,870
it. So take take one minute and that way
everyone gets some chance to think about

2376
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:20,880
everyone gets some chance to think about
 

2377
00:54:20,880 --> 00:55:29,270
everyone gets some chance to think about
it.

2378
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:29,280

 

2379
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,870

Okay.

2380
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
Okay.
 

2381
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,390
Okay.
So,

2382
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:32,400
So,
 

2383
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,790
So,
why doesn't this idea work? Yeah.

2384
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:34,800
why doesn't this idea work? Yeah.
 

2385
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,790
why doesn't this idea work? Yeah.
someone or

2386
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:38,800

 

2387
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,470

>> returning a value corresponding to an

2388
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:40,480
>> returning a value corresponding to an
 

2389
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,150
>> returning a value corresponding to an
exact match is problematic and I think

2390
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,160
exact match is problematic and I think
 

2391
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,750
exact match is problematic and I think
we should instead return a distribution

2392
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,760
we should instead return a distribution
 

2393
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,270
we should instead return a distribution
over matches.

2394
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:45,280
over matches.
 

2395
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,950
over matches.
>> Okay, we return the distribution but why

2396
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:46,960
>> Okay, we return the distribution but why
 

2397
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,390
>> Okay, we return the distribution but why
is it problematic? Yeah,

2398
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:48,400
is it problematic? Yeah,
 

2399
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,470
is it problematic? Yeah,
>> there aren't exact matches between

2400
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:50,480
>> there aren't exact matches between
 

2401
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,390
>> there aren't exact matches between
>> there basically aren't exact matches,

2402
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:52,400
>> there basically aren't exact matches,
 

2403
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,390
>> there basically aren't exact matches,
right? How are you going to find these

2404
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:54,400
right? How are you going to find these
 

2405
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,230
right? How are you going to find these
exact matches? It's really really I mean

2406
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,240
exact matches? It's really really I mean
 

2407
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,430
exact matches? It's really really I mean
it's basically like my input, right?

2408
00:55:59,430 --> 00:55:59,440
it's basically like my input, right?
 

2409
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,230
it's basically like my input, right?
Everything here

2410
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:04,240

 

2411
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,150

these are all English words

2412
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:08,160

 

2413
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,870

here here everything I'm doing is is uh

2414
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:10,880
here here everything I'm doing is is uh
 

2415
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,069
here here everything I'm doing is is uh
in a different language let's say it's

2416
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:12,079
in a different language let's say it's
 

2417
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,470
in a different language let's say it's
Chinese words or marati words right so

2418
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:14,480
Chinese words or marati words right so
 

2419
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,190
Chinese words or marati words right so
then

2420
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,200
then
 

2421
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,349
then
there's never going to be an exact match

2422
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:19,359
there's never going to be an exact match
 

2423
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,589
there's never going to be an exact match
right uh so exact matches you're

2424
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:21,599
right uh so exact matches you're
 

2425
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,270
right uh so exact matches you're
basically just never going to find and

2426
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:25,280
basically just never going to find and
 

2427
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,870
basically just never going to find and
even if you did basically there's

2428
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:26,880
even if you did basically there's
 

2429
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,430
even if you did basically there's
another big problem here which is that

2430
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,440
another big problem here which is that
 

2431
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,670
another big problem here which is that
the initialization problem is terrible.

2432
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
the initialization problem is terrible.
 

2433
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,109
the initialization problem is terrible.
Like how do you start with something?

2434
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:33,119
Like how do you start with something?
 

2435
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,630
Like how do you start with something?
You have to start you if you even if you

2436
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:34,640
You have to start you if you even if you
 

2437
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,549
You have to start you if you even if you
want to learn these you have to start

2438
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:36,559
want to learn these you have to start
 

2439
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,470
want to learn these you have to start
with something

2440
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:38,480
with something
 

2441
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,069
with something
at initialization you're never going to

2442
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:40,079
at initialization you're never going to
 

2443
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,670
at initialization you're never going to
have any exact meshes. You're not even

2444
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:41,680
have any exact meshes. You're not even
 

2445
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,870
have any exact meshes. You're not even
going to have uh so it's just a

2446
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:44,880
going to have uh so it's just a
 

2447
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,030
going to have uh so it's just a
disaster basically. Um and we we

2448
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,040
disaster basically. Um and we we
 

2449
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,349
disaster basically. Um and we we
uh we don't want and even if you had you

2450
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:51,359
uh we don't want and even if you had you
 

2451
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,109
uh we don't want and even if you had you
could never even improve right how could

2452
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:53,119
could never even improve right how could
 

2453
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,630
could never even improve right how could
you improve on this even if you had bad

2454
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:54,640
you improve on this even if you had bad
 

2455
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,150
you improve on this even if you had bad
initialization.

2456
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
initialization.
 

2457
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,789
initialization.
Uh so this is just a basic bad idea. It

2458
00:56:58,789 --> 00:56:58,799
Uh so this is just a basic bad idea. It
 

2459
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,789
Uh so this is just a basic bad idea. It
doesn't work. So the problem with this

2460
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:00,799
doesn't work. So the problem with this
 

2461
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:05,190
doesn't work. So the problem with this
is that

2462
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:05,200

 

2463
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:15,510

we'll never have exact match

2464
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:15,520

 

2465
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,670

initialization

2466
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:19,680

 

2467
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,990

doesn't work.

2468
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:24,000

 

2469
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,390

Okay.

2470
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:26,400
Okay.
 

2471
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,390
Okay.
Okay. So, you're just going to keep

2472
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:28,400
Okay. So, you're just going to keep
 

2473
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,870
Okay. So, you're just going to keep
basically returning like not found, you

2474
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:30,880
basically returning like not found, you
 

2475
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,109
basically returning like not found, you
know, not found, not found, not found.

2476
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
know, not found, not found, not found.
 

2477
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,870
know, not found, not found, not found.
Therefore, you have nothing to improve

2478
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:34,880
Therefore, you have nothing to improve
 

2479
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:39,030
Therefore, you have nothing to improve
on. There's no uh good gradient. Okay.

2480
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:39,040
on. There's no uh good gradient. Okay.
 

2481
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,950
on. There's no uh good gradient. Okay.
So, then does anyone have an idea zero

2482
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:42,960
So, then does anyone have an idea zero
 

2483
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,109
So, then does anyone have an idea zero
or what we can try to do next?

2484
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:47,119
or what we can try to do next?
 

2485
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,349
or what we can try to do next?
Yeah. Or maybe someone else is you.

2486
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:49,359
Yeah. Or maybe someone else is you.
 

2487
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:54,069
Yeah. Or maybe someone else is you.
Yeah.

2488
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:54,079

 

2489
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,829

vectors.

2490
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:55,839
vectors.
 

2491
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,190
vectors.
>> Keys and values. So you're never

2492
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:57,200
>> Keys and values. So you're never
 

2493
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,430
>> Keys and values. So you're never
comparing keys and values. Your

2494
00:57:59,430 --> 00:57:59,440
comparing keys and values. Your
 

2495
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,870
comparing keys and values. Your

2496
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:00,880
>> queries and keys are what are being
 

2497
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,950
>> queries and keys are what are being

2498
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:02,960
compared to each other. So you could
 

2499
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,549
compared to each other. So you could
look at queries and keys and you want to

2500
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:04,559
look at queries and keys and you want to
 

2501
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:07,750
look at queries and keys and you want to
compare them.

2502
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:07,760
compare them.
 

2503
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,030
compare them.
>> You want some kind of similarity

>> You want some kind of similarity

2506
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760

2507
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,270
measure.
>> You want to get some kind of similarity

2508
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:11,280
>> You want to get some kind of similarity
 

2509
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,390
>> You want to get some kind of similarity
measure. And we're gonna we're gonna get

2510
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,400
measure. And we're gonna we're gonna get
 

2511
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,630
measure. And we're gonna we're gonna get
to a similarity measure because you many

2512
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:16,640
to a similarity measure because you many
 

2513
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,349
to a similarity measure because you many
of you probably seen the tension before.

2514
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:19,359
of you probably seen the tension before.
 

2515
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,030
of you probably seen the tension before.
But what's the idea that's like what's

2516
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:21,040
But what's the idea that's like what's
 

2517
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,750
But what's the idea that's like what's
the idea in between that isn't quite a

2518
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:23,760
the idea in between that isn't quite a
 

2519
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,230
the idea in between that isn't quite a
similarity measure but um you can just

2520
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:26,240
similarity measure but um you can just
 

2521
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,190
similarity measure but um you can just
say you can't find an exact match. So

2522
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:29,200
say you can't find an exact match. So
 

2523
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,870
say you can't find an exact match. So
the next idea is just to say return the

2524
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
the next idea is just to say return the
 

2525
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:40,710
the next idea is just to say return the
closest match,

2526
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:40,720

 

2527
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,549

right?

2528
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:42,559
right?
 

2529
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,069
right?
But just returning one closest match

2530
00:58:46,069 --> 00:58:46,079
But just returning one closest match
 

2531
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,430
But just returning one closest match
also doesn't really quite work. And

2532
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:49,440
also doesn't really quite work. And
 

2533
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,109
also doesn't really quite work. And
what's the problem with just returning

2534
00:58:51,109 --> 00:58:51,119
what's the problem with just returning
 

2535
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,349
what's the problem with just returning
that one closest match?

2536
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:53,359
that one closest match?
 

2537
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,670
that one closest match?
>> Yeah,

2538
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:55,680
>> Yeah,
 

2539
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,990
>> Yeah,
>> I have one word mapping to several words

2540
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
>> I have one word mapping to several words
 

2541
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,549
>> I have one word mapping to several words
in the output or vice versa. So like

2542
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:00,559
in the output or vice versa. So like
 

2543
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,349
in the output or vice versa. So like
only attending to one

2544
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:03,359
only attending to one
 

2545
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,670
only attending to one
um

2546
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:05,680
um
 

2547
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,390
um
only attending to like one word in the

only attending to like one word in the
 

2549
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,390
only attending to like one word in the
input sequence isn't necessarily

2550
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,400
input sequence isn't necessarily
 

2551
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,390
input sequence isn't necessarily
sufficient to generate the the proper

2552
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:12,400
sufficient to generate the the proper
 

2553
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:12,950
sufficient to generate the the proper
output.

2554
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:12,960

2555
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,670

2557

2559
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:18,710
might want to do this. There might be
several levels of this that we want to

00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:18,720
several levels of this that we want to
 

2561
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,230
several levels of this that we want to
do. We might want to attend to several

2562
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:20,240
do. We might want to attend to several
 

2563
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,589
do. We might want to attend to several
things. But um there's a even more

2564
00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:23,599
things. But um there's a even more
 

2565
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,589
things. But um there's a even more
fundamental problem in some sense that

2566
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:25,599
fundamental problem in some sense that
 

2567
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,549
fundamental problem in some sense that
like this just won't work

2568
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:28,559
like this just won't work
 

2569
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,109
like this just won't work
mechanistically. It won't work.

2570
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:31,119
mechanistically. It won't work.
 

2571
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,950

2577
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,190

it'll be basically I mean so what's

2578
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:39,200
it'll be basically I mean so what's
 

2579
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,950
it'll be basically I mean so what's
going to happen is that if I'm returning

2580
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:40,960
going to happen is that if I'm returning
 

2581
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,670
going to happen is that if I'm returning
the closest match and then you perturb

2582
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:43,680
the closest match and then you perturb
 

2583
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,069
the closest match and then you perturb
the query a little bit, right? the

2584
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:46,079
the query a little bit, right? the
 

2585
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,190
the query a little bit, right? the
closest match is still the same. So you

2586
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:49,200
closest match is still the same. So you
 

2587
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,710
closest match is still the same. So you
have this basically like peacewise

2588
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
have this basically like peacewise
 

2589
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,789
have this basically like peacewise
constant type of thing where you're

2590
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:52,799
constant type of thing where you're
 

2591
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:57,510
constant type of thing where you're
going to have a bunch of zero gradients,

2592
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:57,520

 

2593
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,589

right? So you're not going to be able to

2594
00:59:59,589 --> 00:59:59,599
right? So you're not going to be able to
 

2595
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,510
right? So you're not going to be able to
learn this thing if you just return the

2596
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:01,520
learn this thing if you just return the
 

2597
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,390
learn this thing if you just return the
closest match.

2598
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:04,400
closest match.
 

2599
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,630
closest match.
So even though that seems like a really

2600
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:06,640
So even though that seems like a really
 

2601
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,470
So even though that seems like a really
reasonable idea, learning it is a total

2602
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:10,480
reasonable idea, learning it is a total
 

2603
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,750
reasonable idea, learning it is a total
failure. Okay. So the idea with this is

2604
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:13,760
failure. Okay. So the idea with this is
 

2605
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:22,870
failure. Okay. So the idea with this is
that or the problem with this

2606
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:22,880

 

2607
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:38,630

uh this is like this has bad gradients.

2608
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:38,640

 

2609
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,710

Small

2610
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:40,720

2611
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,190
Small
changes

2612
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:43,200
changes
 

2613
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:50,309
changes
to the query

2614
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:50,319

 

2615
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:53,430

will not

2616
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:53,440
will not
 

2617
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,349
will not
change

2618
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:57,359

 

2619
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:00,789

match.

2620
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:00,799

 

2621
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,870

Okay.

2622
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:02,880
Okay.
 

2623
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,789
Okay.
So then now we come to this idea one

2624
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:06,799
So then now we come to this idea one
 

2625
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:14,309
So then now we come to this idea one
let's call it.

2626
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:14,319

 

2627
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:17,190

So we don't want to return just one

2628
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:17,200
So we don't want to return just one
 

2629
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,430
So we don't want to return just one
closest match. So what's the natural

2630
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:21,440
closest match. So what's the natural
 

2631
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,789
closest match. So what's the natural
next idea?

2632
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:26,799

 

2633
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,390

>> Yeah

2634
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:28,400
>> Yeah
 

2635
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,430
>> Yeah
possible matches.

2636
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:29,440
possible matches.
 

2637
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,190
possible matches.
>> Return a distribution over possible

2638
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
>> Return a distribution over possible
 

2639
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,670
>> Return a distribution over possible
matches. I'm going to take the simpler

2640
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:33,680
matches. I'm going to take the simpler
 

2641
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,510
matches. I'm going to take the simpler
version of that which is just to say

2642
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:35,520
version of that which is just to say
 

2643
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,109
version of that which is just to say
return me the top K mattress or K is

2644
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:39,119
return me the top K mattress or K is
 

2645
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,950
return me the top K mattress or K is
keys here top return me the top L

2646
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:40,960
keys here top return me the top L
 

2647
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,270
keys here top return me the top L
mattress right

2648
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:43,280
mattress right
 

2649
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,470
mattress right
um so let's say look at the close look

2650
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:46,480
um so let's say look at the close look
 

2651
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,750
um so let's say look at the close look
at the multiple closest matches look at

2652
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:51,760

 

2653
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,829

the top

2654
01:01:53,829 --> 01:01:53,839
the top
 

2655
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,390
the top
L

2656
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,400
L
 

2657
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,109
L
matches okay

2658
01:01:59,109 --> 01:01:59,119
matches okay
 

2659
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,990
matches okay
and then you know if I look if I have

2660
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:02,000
and then you know if I look if I have
 

2661
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,470
and then you know if I look if I have
one query and then I have K1, K2, K3, KL

2662
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:06,480
one query and then I have K1, K2, K3, KL
 

2663
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,109
one query and then I have K1, K2, K3, KL
keys that are the top L matches for

2664
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:09,119
keys that are the top L matches for
 

2665
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,030
keys that are the top L matches for
that, then that gives me L values,

2666
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:13,040
that, then that gives me L values,
 

2667
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,030
that, then that gives me L values,
right? And what do I want to do? I want

2668
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:15,040
right? And what do I want to do? I want
 

2669
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,670
right? And what do I want to do? I want
to be able to somehow use these values.

2670
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:17,680
to be able to somehow use these values.
 

2671
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,670
to be able to somehow use these values.
So what's the I want I want to get a

2672
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:19,680
So what's the I want I want to get a
 

2673
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,589
So what's the I want I want to get a
value. So what's the way to combine

2674
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:21,599
value. So what's the way to combine
 

2675
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:22,950
value. So what's the way to combine
these values? That's the natural thing

2676
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:22,960
these values? That's the natural thing
 

2677
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,950
these values? That's the natural thing
to do.

2678
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:26,960

 

2679
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,030

dotproduct values are all the they're

2680
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:29,040
dotproduct values are all the they're
 

2681
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,589
dotproduct values are all the they're
all just uh

2682
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:31,599
all just uh
 

2683
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,349
all just uh
like I have many of them right I have l

2684
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:33,359
like I have many of them right I have l
 

2685
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,950
like I have many of them right I have l
of them

2686
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
of them
 

2687
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,390
of them
yeah

2688
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:36,400
yeah
 

2689
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,270
yeah
>> you could just average them right so I

2690
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:39,280
>> you could just average them right so I
 

2691
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,829
>> you could just average them right so I
have

2692
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:41,839
have
 

2693
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:47,589
have
um so I have l different values

2694
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:47,599

 

2695
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,510

and so

2696
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:49,520
and so
 

2697
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,710
and so
I can try to do

2698
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:52,720
I can try to do
 

2699
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,109
I can try to do
1 / l

2700
01:02:55,109 --> 01:02:55,119
1 / l
 

2701
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:56,309
1 / l
and that could be the value

2702
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:56,319
and that could be the value
 

2703
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:00,309
and that could be the value
corresponding to this

2704
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:00,319

 

2705
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:03,109

one to let's say L.

2706
01:03:03,109 --> 01:03:03,119
one to let's say L.
 

2707
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,870
one to let's say L.
But the problem with this is while it's

2708
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
But the problem with this is while it's
 

2709
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,190
But the problem with this is while it's
a good idea, it still has the problem of

2710
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:09,200
a good idea, it still has the problem of
 

2711
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,109
a good idea, it still has the problem of
not really helping, not being easy to

2712
01:03:11,109 --> 01:03:11,119
not really helping, not being easy to
 

2713
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,309
not really helping, not being easy to
learn because now even with this, a

2714
01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:14,319
learn because now even with this, a
 

2715
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,430
learn because now even with this, a
small change in my query still doesn't

2716
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:17,440
small change in my query still doesn't
 

2717
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,029
small change in my query still doesn't
lead to big changes here or small. So

2718
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:21,039
lead to big changes here or small. So
 

2719
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,549
lead to big changes here or small. So
again, I have this problem of zero

2720
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:22,559
again, I have this problem of zero
 

2721
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,069
again, I have this problem of zero
gradient even with this setup. Okay, so

2722
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:26,079
gradient even with this setup. Okay, so
 

2723
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:27,910
gradient even with this setup. Okay, so
I'm not really by averaging I'm not

2724
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:27,920
I'm not really by averaging I'm not
 

2725
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,789
I'm not really by averaging I'm not
really using the fact that I fanned out

2726
01:03:30,789 --> 01:03:30,799
really using the fact that I fanned out
 

2727
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:35,190
really using the fact that I fanned out
to L different matches.

2728
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:35,200

 

2729
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,470

Okay, so if I want to use the fact that

2730
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:38,480
Okay, so if I want to use the fact that
 

2731
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,549
Okay, so if I want to use the fact that
there's L things and not collapse them

2732
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:40,559
there's L things and not collapse them
 

2733
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,270
there's L things and not collapse them
into one, what's a way to combine them

2734
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:43,280
into one, what's a way to combine them
 

2735
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,230
into one, what's a way to combine them
that can do that? Well, one natural way

2736
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,240
that can do that? Well, one natural way
 

2737
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,230
that can do that? Well, one natural way
is to do a weighted average, right? So

2738
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
is to do a weighted average, right? So
 

2739
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,549
is to do a weighted average, right? So
that I'm kind of I can choose how much I

2740
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:50,559
that I'm kind of I can choose how much I
 

2741
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,710
that I'm kind of I can choose how much I
care about each value. Okay.

2742
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:54,720
care about each value. Okay.
 

2743
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,789
care about each value. Okay.
So, what I'm going to try next is I'm

2744
01:03:56,789 --> 01:03:56,799
So, what I'm going to try next is I'm
 

2745
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:02,390
So, what I'm going to try next is I'm
going to try next try

2746
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:02,400

 

2747
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:08,069

is a weighted average.

2748
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:08,079

 

2749
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,750

So I want to have something

2750
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:11,760
So I want to have something
 

2751
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:20,549
So I want to have something
remember L

2752
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:20,559

 

2753
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,870

some alpha I b I and I want this thing

2754
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:24,880
some alpha I b I and I want this thing
 

2755
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,510
some alpha I b I and I want this thing
to be a scalar

2756
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520

 

2757
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,270

and what's one way that one might want

2758
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:31,280
and what's one way that one might want
 

2759
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,789
and what's one way that one might want
to think about waiting these values well

2760
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:34,799
to think about waiting these values well
 

2761
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:35,990
to think about waiting these values well
I mean this has come up in the

2762
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,000
I mean this has come up in the
 

2763
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,710
I mean this has come up in the
conversation already Right? I have a

2764
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:38,720
conversation already Right? I have a
 

2765
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,349
conversation already Right? I have a
query. I have keys. Each of these values

2766
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:41,359
query. I have keys. Each of these values
 

2767
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,829
query. I have keys. Each of these values
is associated with a different key.

2768
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:43,839
is associated with a different key.
 

2769
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:47,670
is associated with a different key.
Well, maybe I should care more about the

2770
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:47,680
Well, maybe I should care more about the
 

2771
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,390
Well, maybe I should care more about the
keys and the values that I'm very

2772
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:50,400
keys and the values that I'm very
 

2773
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,789
keys and the values that I'm very
similar with and I should care less

2774
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:52,799
similar with and I should care less
 

2775
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:56,470
similar with and I should care less
about the keys and values that I'm

2776
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:56,480
about the keys and values that I'm
 

2777
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,990
about the keys and values that I'm
less similar with. Right? Does that make

2778
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,000
less similar with. Right? Does that make
 

2779
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,309
less similar with. Right? Does that make
sense? Yes.

2780
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
sense? Yes.
 

2781
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:03,990
sense? Yes.
What is the difference between this

2782
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,000
What is the difference between this
 

2783
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,150
What is the difference between this
method and the previous idea regarding

We haven't really talked about how we're

01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:35,510

I have no exact matches, right? So, I

01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:51,920
I have no exact matches, right? So, I
 

2817
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,750
I have no exact matches, right? So, I
have some vector somewhere. I'm in some

2818
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:53,760
have some vector somewhere. I'm in some

01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,270
have some vector somewhere. I'm in some

2822
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:57,680
high dimensional space and so basically
 

2823
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,109
high dimensional space and so basically
all the vectors are all far away from

all the vectors are all far away from
 

2825
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,349
all the vectors are all far away from
each other and so I have some small

2826
01:06:01,349 --> 01:06:01,359
each other and so I have some small
 

2827
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,990
each other and so I have some small
perturbation to my query.

2828
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:04,000
perturbation to my query.
 

2829
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,150

Odds are the closest thing to me is

01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,309
Okay.
So, what we're going to do here is we're

2858
01:06:42,309 --> 01:06:42,319
So, what we're going to do here is we're
 

2859
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:45,670
So, what we're going to do here is we're
going to fix this by saying I'm going to

2860
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:45,680
going to fix this by saying I'm going to
 

2861
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,549
going to fix this by saying I'm going to
do um

2862
01:06:48,549 --> 01:06:48,559
do um
 

2863
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,470
do um
1 / L

2864
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:50,480
1 / L
 

2865
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,950
1 / L
sum of some similarity measure

2866
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:54,960
sum of some similarity measure
 

2867
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,950
sum of some similarity measure
between Q

2868
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:56,960
between Q
 

2869
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,510
between Q
and K

2870
01:06:59,510 --> 01:06:59,520
and K
 

2871
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:07,270
and K
and the value. Okay,

2872
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:07,280

 

2873
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,670

so this allows me to weight the

2874
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:09,680
so this allows me to weight the
 

2875
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,150
so this allows me to weight the
different values based on my similarity

2876
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:12,160
different values based on my similarity
 

2877
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,150
different values based on my similarity
with my query. Okay,

2878
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:16,160
with my query. Okay,
 

2879
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,390
with my query. Okay,
here I guess this is query I. This

2880
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:18,400
here I guess this is query I. This
 

2881
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,230
here I guess this is query I. This
should be I. This is sum over i.

2882
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:22,240
should be I. This is sum over i.
 

2883
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,950
should be I. This is sum over i.
Okay, so I look at my different uh and

2884
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:24,960
Okay, so I look at my different uh and
 

2885
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,710
Okay, so I look at my different uh and
so how do I pick this similarity

2886
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:26,720
so how do I pick this similarity
 

2887
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,870
so how do I pick this similarity
measure? Well, the standard similarity

2888
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:28,880
measure? Well, the standard similarity
 

2889
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,630
measure? Well, the standard similarity
measure that we're very used to and we

2890
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:30,640
measure that we're very used to and we
 

2891
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,670
measure that we're very used to and we
like using is

2892
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:33,680
like using is
 

2893
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,750
like using is
dotproduct, right? Inner product. So

2894
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:35,760
dotproduct, right? Inner product. So
 

2895
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,190
dotproduct, right? Inner product. So
this we're just going to choose to be

2896
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:37,200
this we're just going to choose to be
 

2897
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,270
this we're just going to choose to be
inner product.

2898
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:41,280

 

2899
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,430

But it doesn't have to be inner product,

2900
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:43,440
But it doesn't have to be inner product,
 

2901
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,750
But it doesn't have to be inner product,
right? there's like choices that you

2902
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:45,760
right? there's like choices that you
 

2903
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,910
right? there's like choices that you
that you could make.

2904
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:49,920
that you could make.
 

2905
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,589
that you could make.
Inner product turns out to be a good

2906
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:51,599
Inner product turns out to be a good
 

2907
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,510
Inner product turns out to be a good
natural choice. It's easy to implement.

2908
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:53,520
natural choice. It's easy to implement.
 

2909
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,710
natural choice. It's easy to implement.
GPUs like doing matrix multiplies. Um

2910
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:56,720
GPUs like doing matrix multiplies. Um
 

2911
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,630
GPUs like doing matrix multiplies. Um
you know this is this makes this makes a

2912
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:58,640
you know this is this makes this makes a
 

2913
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,789
you know this is this makes this makes a
lot of sense. But what we're the reason

2914
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:00,799
lot of sense. But what we're the reason
 

2915
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:01,829
lot of sense. But what we're the reason
we're doing in our product is we're

2916
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:01,839
we're doing in our product is we're
 

2917
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:04,950
we're doing in our product is we're
trying to get at a similarity measure.

2918
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:04,960
trying to get at a similarity measure.
 

2919
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,349
trying to get at a similarity measure.
And then what we want to be able to do

2920
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:07,359
And then what we want to be able to do
 

2921
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:10,069
And then what we want to be able to do
is we want to be able to actually turn

2922
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:10,079
is we want to be able to actually turn
 

2923
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,990
is we want to be able to actually turn
this into something like a probability,

2924
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:12,000
this into something like a probability,
 

2925
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,309
this into something like a probability,
right? We don't want to have the problem

2926
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:14,319
right? We don't want to have the problem
 

2927
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:15,750
right? We don't want to have the problem
with in their product is that they can

2928
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:15,760
with in their product is that they can
 

2929
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,149
with in their product is that they can
get very big.

2930
01:08:18,149 --> 01:08:18,159
get very big.
 

2931
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:20,149
get very big.
And so to be able to make sure that our

2932
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
And so to be able to make sure that our
 

2933
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:21,590
And so to be able to make sure that our
numbers don't blow up because neural

2934
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:21,600
numbers don't blow up because neural
 

2935
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,229
numbers don't blow up because neural
networks never like when things blow up,

2936
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:24,239
networks never like when things blow up,
 

2937
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:26,070
networks never like when things blow up,
instead of using just the inner product,

2938
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:26,080
instead of using just the inner product,
 

2939
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,309
instead of using just the inner product,
what are we going to use? We're going to

2940
01:08:28,309 --> 01:08:28,319
what are we going to use? We're going to
 

2941
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,309
what are we going to use? We're going to
use the soft max over the inner

2942
01:08:30,309 --> 01:08:30,319
use the soft max over the inner
 

2943
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,070
use the soft max over the inner
products, right? So that we're going to

2944
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:32,080
products, right? So that we're going to
 

2945
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,189
products, right? So that we're going to
have we're going to make sure that all

2946
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:33,199
have we're going to make sure that all
 

2947
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:35,590
have we're going to make sure that all
the values remain in nice contained

2948
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:35,600
the values remain in nice contained
 

2949
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,430
the values remain in nice contained
intervals.

2950
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:37,440
intervals.
 

2951
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,349
intervals.
Okay? So we're really going to go from

2952
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:39,359
Okay? So we're really going to go from
 

2953
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,349
Okay? So we're really going to go from
here to a soft max.

2954
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:43,359
here to a soft max.
 

2955
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:51,510
here to a soft max.
Okay.

2956
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:51,520

 

2957
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,789

And now what we are left with is well

2958
01:08:54,789 --> 01:08:54,799
And now what we are left with is well
 

2959
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:56,309
And now what we are left with is well
you know we said like let's say we had

2960
01:08:56,309 --> 01:08:56,319
you know we said like let's say we had
 

2961
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:57,910
you know we said like let's say we had
the queries keys and values and then

2962
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920
the queries keys and values and then
 

2963
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,229
the queries keys and values and then
what do we do?

2964
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:00,239
what do we do?
 

2965
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:01,829
what do we do?
So far I haven't really told you about

2966
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:01,839
So far I haven't really told you about
 

2967
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:05,269
So far I haven't really told you about
what the learnable parameters here are.

2968
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:05,279
what the learnable parameters here are.
 

2969
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,789
what the learnable parameters here are.
How do I get Q, K, and V? That's where

2970
01:09:08,789 --> 01:09:08,799
How do I get Q, K, and V? That's where
 

2971
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:11,030
How do I get Q, K, and V? That's where
we're going to put the learning in. So,

2972
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,040
we're going to put the learning in. So,
 

2973
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:24,470
we're going to put the learning in. So,
we're going to say, how do we get,

2974
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:24,480

 

2975
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:29,189

we're going to learn them.

2976
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:29,199

 

2977
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,950

And so the way we're going to learn them

2978
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:30,960
And so the way we're going to learn them
 

2979
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,149
And so the way we're going to learn them
is we're going to just have them be some

2980
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:34,159
is we're going to just have them be some
 

2981
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:36,309
is we're going to just have them be some
linear transformation

2982
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:36,319
linear transformation
 

2983
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,309
linear transformation
of our input. So we're going to have

2984
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,319
of our input. So we're going to have
 

2985
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,470
of our input. So we're going to have
some matrices. So for example, I have my

2986
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:40,480
some matrices. So for example, I have my
 

2987
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,110
some matrices. So for example, I have my
input

2988
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,120
input
 

2989
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:53,749
input
and I'm going to put this

2990
01:09:53,749 --> 01:09:53,759

 

2991
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,910

into some matrix

2992
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:57,920

 

2993
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:02,550

W K. This is going to give me my key.

2994
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:02,560
W K. This is going to give me my key.
 

2995
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:08,229
W K. This is going to give me my key.
Similarly, I'll have some

2996
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:08,239

 

2997
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:41,110

ah

2998
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:41,120

 

2999
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,630

And these W K, WQ, and WV are going to

3000
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:44,640
And these W K, WQ, and WV are going to
 

3001
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,430
And these W K, WQ, and WV are going to
be my learnable parameters.

3002
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:47,440
be my learnable parameters.
 

3003
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,790
be my learnable parameters.
Okay,

3004
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:50,800

 

3005
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,950

that's how we're going to have gradients

3006
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:52,960
that's how we're going to have gradients
 

3007
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,030
that's how we're going to have gradients
uh going through all of these things.

3008
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:55,040
uh going through all of these things.
 

3009
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,229
uh going through all of these things.
Okay, so this thing what I've talked to

3010
01:10:58,229 --> 01:10:58,239
Okay, so this thing what I've talked to
 

3011
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:01,350
Okay, so this thing what I've talked to
you about this is basically this key

3012
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:01,360
you about this is basically this key
 

3013
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:05,110
you about this is basically this key
idea of cross attention. Okay, so we

3014
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:05,120
idea of cross attention. Okay, so we
 

3015
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,550
idea of cross attention. Okay, so we
talked about this saying look we are

3016
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:06,560
talked about this saying look we are
 

3017
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,790
talked about this saying look we are
we're trying to go from we have this

3018
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:08,800
we're trying to go from we have this
 

3019
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,950
we're trying to go from we have this
encoder and we have this decoder

3020
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:12,960
encoder and we have this decoder
 

3021
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,149
encoder and we have this decoder
and I want the decoder to know where in

3022
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:16,159
and I want the decoder to know where in
 

3023
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,149
and I want the decoder to know where in
the encoder should I be paying attention

3024
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:18,159
the encoder should I be paying attention
 

3025
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:24,550
the encoder should I be paying attention
to.

3026
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,560

 

3027
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,950

That is the key idea of cross attention.

3028
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:28,960
That is the key idea of cross attention.
 

3029
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,270
That is the key idea of cross attention.
So I'm looking at queries that are

3030
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:31,280
So I'm looking at queries that are
 

3031
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,470
So I'm looking at queries that are
originating from the decoder and my keys

3032
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:34,480
originating from the decoder and my keys
 

3033
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,550
originating from the decoder and my keys
and values are all things that are

3034
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:36,560
and values are all things that are
 

3035
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,270
and values are all things that are
computed from my encoder. Okay,

3036
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:41,280
computed from my encoder. Okay,
 

3037
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,189
computed from my encoder. Okay,
this ended up working well and so

3038
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:45,199
this ended up working well and so
 

3039
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,870
this ended up working well and so
building on this there was the natural

3040
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:46,880
building on this there was the natural
 

3041
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,430
building on this there was the natural
next step of understanding self

3042
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:49,440
next step of understanding self
 

3043
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,950
next step of understanding self
attention.

3044
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:50,960
attention.
 

3045
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,790
attention.
Self attention was basically where the

3046
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:52,800
Self attention was basically where the
 

3047
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,630
Self attention was basically where the
queries and keys and values are all

3048
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:54,640
queries and keys and values are all
 

3049
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,790
queries and keys and values are all
coming just from the decoder. So maybe

3050
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:56,800
coming just from the decoder. So maybe
 

3051
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,390
coming just from the decoder. So maybe
it's worth it for me to not just pay

3052
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:58,400
it's worth it for me to not just pay
 

3053
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,430
it's worth it for me to not just pay
attention back to the encoder, but also

3054
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:01,440
attention back to the encoder, but also
 

3055
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,830
attention back to the encoder, but also
what did I just say before this?

3056
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:05,840

 

3057
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,790

So that's the idea of self attention.

3058
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:08,800
So that's the idea of self attention.
 

3059
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,270
So that's the idea of self attention.
Okay? And so you know often when you

3060
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:11,280
Okay? And so you know often when you
 

3061
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,470
Okay? And so you know often when you
read about this, you'll read about self

3062
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:12,480
read about this, you'll read about self
 

3063
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,950
read about this, you'll read about self
attention first and then cross attention

3064
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:14,960
attention first and then cross attention
 

3065
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,830
attention first and then cross attention
later. But the historical development

3066
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:17,840
later. But the historical development
 

3067
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,070
later. But the historical development
was that cross attention came first,

3068
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:20,080
was that cross attention came first,
 

3069
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,709
was that cross attention came first,
then came self attention. And then it

3070
01:12:22,709 --> 01:12:22,719
then came self attention. And then it
 

3071
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:24,310
then came self attention. And then it
turns out that you know you sometimes

3072
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:24,320
turns out that you know you sometimes
 

3073
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,830
turns out that you know you sometimes
it's useful to have these self attention

3074
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:25,840
it's useful to have these self attention
 

3075
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,950
it's useful to have these self attention
connections also in the encoder and that

3076
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:28,960
connections also in the encoder and that
 

3077
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,750
connections also in the encoder and that
can also be helpful. So now there's

3078
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:31,760
can also be helpful. So now there's
 

3079
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,030
can also be helpful. So now there's
there's self attention connection in the

3080
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
there's self attention connection in the
 

3081
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,550
there's self attention connection in the
encoder self attention connections in

3082
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:34,560
encoder self attention connections in
 

3083
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,350
encoder self attention connections in
the decoder as well.

3084
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:37,360
the decoder as well.
 

3085
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,950
the decoder as well.
And so if you want to have an explicit

3086
01:12:38,950 --> 01:12:38,960
And so if you want to have an explicit
 

3087
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,950
And so if you want to have an explicit
formula if I want to have the attention

3088
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:42,960
formula if I want to have the attention
 

3089
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,550
formula if I want to have the attention
between you know let's say xm and xn

3090
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:46,560
between you know let's say xm and xn
 

3091
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,590
between you know let's say xm and xn
then that's basically

3092
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:49,600
then that's basically
 

3093
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,669
then that's basically
this. This is where we come to. It's

3094
01:12:51,669 --> 01:12:51,679
this. This is where we come to. It's
 

3095
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,390
this. This is where we come to. It's
basically the soft max of these things.

3096
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:54,400
basically the soft max of these things.
 

3097
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:58,149
basically the soft max of these things.
Okay. So I look at the inner product of

3098
01:12:58,149 --> 01:12:58,159
Okay. So I look at the inner product of
 

3099
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,790
Okay. So I look at the inner product of
the keys and the queries and then I take

3100
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:00,800
the keys and the queries and then I take
 

3101
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,110
the keys and the queries and then I take
a soft max

3102
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,120
a soft max
 

3103
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,149
a soft max
and compute the attention and that's how

3104
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:06,159
and compute the attention and that's how
 

3105
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,709
and compute the attention and that's how
I decide how much attention how much

3106
01:13:08,709 --> 01:13:08,719
I decide how much attention how much
 

3107
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:11,189
I decide how much attention how much
weight to give to the previous tokens

3108
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:11,199
weight to give to the previous tokens
 

3109
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,270
weight to give to the previous tokens
that I have seen.

3110
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:13,280
that I have seen.
 

3111
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,790
that I have seen.
>> Okay.

3112
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:14,800
>> Okay.
 

3113
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,229
>> Okay.
Yes. So the X's are X is the input to

3114
01:13:18,229 --> 01:13:18,239
Yes. So the X's are X is the input to
 

3115
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:20,070
Yes. So the X's are X is the input to
either the encoder or decoder attribute

3116
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:20,080
either the encoder or decoder attribute
 

3117
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,430
either the encoder or decoder attribute
like some time set.

3118
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:21,440
like some time set.
 

3119
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:26,870
like some time set.
>> Yes.

3120
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880

 

3121
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,630

>> Okay. Any questions about this so far?

3122
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:30,640
>> Okay. Any questions about this so far?
 

3123
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:36,310
>> Okay. Any questions about this so far?
>> Yes.

3124
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:36,320

 

3125
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,630

>> So there okay. So self attention do we

3126
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:38,640
>> So there okay. So self attention do we
 

3127
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,870
>> So there okay. So self attention do we
only look at previous inputs? So I will

3128
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:40,880
only look at previous inputs? So I will
 

3129
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,030
only look at previous inputs? So I will
come to that but basically within self-

3130
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
come to that but basically within self-
 

3131
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,950
come to that but basically within self-
attention there are different there's

3132
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:44,960
attention there are different there's
 

3133
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,270
attention there are different there's
basically masked self attention or

3134
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:47,280
basically masked self attention or
 

3135
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,830
basically masked self attention or
causal self attention and then self

3136
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:49,840
causal self attention and then self
 

3137
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,470
causal self attention and then self
attention and so if you want to make

3138
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:52,480
attention and so if you want to make
 

3139
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,030
attention and so if you want to make
sure that your system does not get some

3140
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:55,040
sure that your system does not get some
 

3141
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,790
sure that your system does not get some
undue advantage by looking into the

3142
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:56,800
undue advantage by looking into the
 

3143
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,510
undue advantage by looking into the
future what you can do is you can set

3144
01:13:59,510 --> 01:13:59,520
future what you can do is you can set
 

3145
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,470
future what you can do is you can set
attention weights for looking uh into

3146
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:02,480
attention weights for looking uh into
 

3147
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,990
attention weights for looking uh into
the future just freeze them to be

3148
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:04,000
the future just freeze them to be
 

3149
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,149
the future just freeze them to be
negative infinity

3150
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:06,159
negative infinity
 

3151
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,669
negative infinity
right and that's what is called masked

3152
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:07,679
right and that's what is called masked
 

3153
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,430
right and that's what is called masked
self attention

3154
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:09,440
self attention
 

3155
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,990
self attention
self attention ention allows you to look

3156
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,000
self attention ention allows you to look
 

3157
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,070
self attention ention allows you to look
everywhere. In a decoder, you would use

3158
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:14,080
everywhere. In a decoder, you would use
 

3159
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,630
everywhere. In a decoder, you would use
masked self intention because you can't

3160
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:16,640
masked self intention because you can't
 

3161
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,630
masked self intention because you can't
look at the future.

3162
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:18,640
look at the future.
 

3163
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,590
look at the future.
Yes. See, in this case of self-

3164
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:21,600
Yes. See, in this case of self-
 

3165
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,270
Yes. See, in this case of self-
inention, you're not actually attending

3166
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:23,280
inention, you're not actually attending
 

3167
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,470
inention, you're not actually attending
to exactly yourself though, right? Or do

3168
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:26,480
to exactly yourself though, right? Or do
 

3169
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,790
to exactly yourself though, right? Or do
you also include yourself like or just

3170
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:28,800
you also include yourself like or just
 

3171
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,390
you also include yourself like or just
the neighbors like every other cycle? I

3172
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:32,400

01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:52,239
um it's only looking at the things that
 

3239
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,229
um it's only looking at the things that
is generated previously. If the decoder

3240
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:54,239
is generated previously. If the decoder
 

3241
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,590
is generated previously. If the decoder
is doing cross attention and looking at

01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,600
is doing cross attention and looking at
 

3243
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,750
is doing cross attention and looking at
the encoder it's looking at everything.

3244
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:57,760
the encoder it's looking at everything.
 

3245
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,229
the encoder it's looking at everything.
It's not cross attention doesn't have

01:16:00,229 --> 01:16:00,239
It's not cross attention doesn't have
 

3247
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,310
It's not cross attention doesn't have
this masking aspect. It's looking at

3248
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:02,320
this masking aspect. It's looking at
 

3249
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,709
this masking aspect. It's looking at
everything in the encoder because you

3250
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:04,719
everything in the encoder because you
 

3251
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,310
everything in the encoder because you
can think of it as that you know we

3252
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:06,320
can think of it as that you know we
 

3253
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,750
can think of it as that you know we
always think that the encoder the full

3254
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:07,760
always think that the encoder the full
 

3255
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,669
always think that the encoder the full
input sentence is available to us

3256
01:16:09,669 --> 01:16:09,679
input sentence is available to us
 

3257
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:11,270
input sentence is available to us
already.

3258
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:11,280
already.
 

3259
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,950
already.
So it doesn't need to know that it we

3260
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:12,960
So it doesn't need to know that it we
 

3261
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,070
So it doesn't need to know that it we
don't need to cut it off at only the

3262
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:14,080
don't need to cut it off at only the
 

3263
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,510
don't need to cut it off at only the
third word or the fifth word or so on

3264
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:15,520
third word or the fifth word or so on
 

3265
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:20,310
third word or the fifth word or so on
and so forth.

3266
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:20,320

 

3267
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,229

>> Yes. Exactly. Because because the word

3268
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:22,239
>> Yes. Exactly. Because because the word
 

3269
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,149
>> Yes. Exactly. Because because the word
like you know maybe it's generated some

3270
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
like you know maybe it's generated some
 

3271
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,910
like you know maybe it's generated some
words but maybe the next word it needs

3272
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:25,920
words but maybe the next word it needs
 

3273
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,669
words but maybe the next word it needs
to generate is in the past. Right. You

3274
01:16:27,669 --> 01:16:27,679
to generate is in the past. Right. You
 

3275
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:29,270
to generate is in the past. Right. You
don't know the word order. That's the

3276
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:29,280
don't know the word order. That's the
 

3277
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,709
don't know the word order. That's the
point in translation. The word order can

3278
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:30,719
point in translation. The word order can
 

3279
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,030
point in translation. The word order can
be completely everywhere. So it needs to

3280
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:33,040
be completely everywhere. So it needs to
 

3281
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,790
be completely everywhere. So it needs to
look at everything in the encoder,

3282
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:34,800
look at everything in the encoder,
 

3283
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,630
look at everything in the encoder,
everything in the input to be able to

3284
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:36,640
everything in the input to be able to
 

3285
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:44,709
everything in the input to be able to
generate the output.

3286
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:44,719

 

3287
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:47,590

>> It it can look at the whole past. Yes.

3288
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:47,600
>> It it can look at the whole past. Yes.
 

3289
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,790
>> It it can look at the whole past. Yes.
Yes. Okay.

3290
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:50,800
Yes. Okay.
 

3291
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,470
Yes. Okay.
So I want to point out one very

3292
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:52,480
So I want to point out one very
 

3293
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,830
So I want to point out one very
important thing. I've written this here.

3294
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:55,840
important thing. I've written this here.
 

3295
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,830
important thing. I've written this here.
This doesn't work. Okay.

3296
01:16:59,830 --> 01:16:59,840
This doesn't work. Okay.
 

3297
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,270
This doesn't work. Okay.
Why doesn't this work?

3298
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:03,280
Why doesn't this work?
 

3299
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,149
Why doesn't this work?
This is not actually what we use.

3300
01:17:06,149 --> 01:17:06,159
This is not actually what we use.
 

3301
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:09,110
This is not actually what we use.
This doesn't work because of one key

3302
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,120
This doesn't work because of one key
 

3303
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:13,430
This doesn't work because of one key
problem which is that these uh dot

3304
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,440
problem which is that these uh dot
 

3305
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,750
problem which is that these uh dot
products can get very large. The inner

3306
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:15,760
products can get very large. The inner
 

3307
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,310
products can get very large. The inner
products can get very large. Therefore,

3308
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:18,320
products can get very large. Therefore,
 

3309
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,870
products can get very large. Therefore,
the soft max can be such that it only

3310
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:20,880
the soft max can be such that it only
 

3311
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,310
the soft max can be such that it only
you know focuses on one input.

3312
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
you know focuses on one input.
 

3313
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,550
you know focuses on one input.
Okay. And so that is not good. And the

3314
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:28,560
Okay. And so that is not good. And the
 

3315
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,830
Okay. And so that is not good. And the
reason this can get or one of the

3316
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:29,840
reason this can get or one of the
 

3317
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,189
reason this can get or one of the
reasons this can get large is that you

3318
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:31,199
reasons this can get large is that you
 

3319
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:34,390
reasons this can get large is that you
can have these very long vectors

3320
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:34,400
can have these very long vectors
 

3321
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,430
can have these very long vectors
uh for your uh keys and your queries. So

3322
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:37,440
uh for your uh keys and your queries. So
 

3323
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,830
uh for your uh keys and your queries. So
what is used now is what is scaled self

3324
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:39,840
what is used now is what is scaled self
 

3325
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,750
what is used now is what is scaled self
attention which is basically where

3326
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:41,760
attention which is basically where
 

3327
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,590
attention which is basically where
you're normalizing everything by square

3328
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:43,600
you're normalizing everything by square
 

3329
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,510
you're normalizing everything by square
root d where d is the dimension of your

3330
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
root d where d is the dimension of your
 

3331
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:54,950
root d where d is the dimension of your
um

3332
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:54,960

 

3333
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,830

>> um no it's what is what do I want to say

3334
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:57,840
>> um no it's what is what do I want to say
 

3335
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,430
>> um no it's what is what do I want to say
so here I'll show you in this picture

3336
01:17:59,430 --> 01:17:59,440
so here I'll show you in this picture
 

3337
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,110
so here I'll show you in this picture
but basically you have um

3338
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:03,120
but basically you have um
 

3339
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,070
but basically you have um
d is your embedding like how how big is

3340
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:06,080
d is your embedding like how how big is
 

3341
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,030
d is your embedding like how how big is
your vector

3342
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:09,040

 

3343
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,990

Okay, so this is a really nice picture

3344
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:12,000
Okay, so this is a really nice picture
 

3345
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,070
Okay, so this is a really nice picture
from the prince book. Uh, so this is

3346
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,080
from the prince book. Uh, so this is
 

3347
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,669
from the prince book. Uh, so this is
your input X. And so I have

3348
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
your input X. And so I have
 

3349
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:20,070
your input X. And so I have
these are the different sequences. So I

3350
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:20,080
these are the different sequences. So I
 

3351
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,550
these are the different sequences. So I
compute my query matrix, my key matrix,

3352
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:24,560
compute my query matrix, my key matrix,
 

3353
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,870
compute my query matrix, my key matrix,
and my value matrix. Then I look at the

3354
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:28,880
and my value matrix. Then I look at the
 

3355
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,390
and my value matrix. Then I look at the
inner product between the queries and

3356
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:30,400
inner product between the queries and
 

3357
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,550
inner product between the queries and
the keys. Use a soft max to get my

3358
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:32,560
the keys. Use a soft max to get my
 

3359
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,149
the keys. Use a soft max to get my
attention. Then I look at the attention

3360
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:36,159
attention. Then I look at the attention
 

3361
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,229
attention. Then I look at the attention
times the values and that gets me my

3362
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:38,239
times the values and that gets me my
 

3363
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:41,189
times the values and that gets me my
output.

3364
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:41,199
output.
 

3365
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:43,510
output.
Okay.

3366
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:43,520
Okay.
 

3367
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,110
Okay.
And so this dimension D

3368
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:47,120
And so this dimension D
 

3369
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,030
And so this dimension D
is what we are normalizing by. And what

3370
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040
is what we are normalizing by. And what
 

3371
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,470
is what we are normalizing by. And what
I want to point out is that what is

3372
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:52,480
I want to point out is that what is
 

3373
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,830
I want to point out is that what is
important here is to get an N byN matrix

3374
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:55,840
important here is to get an N byN matrix
 

3375
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,830
important here is to get an N byN matrix
out here. So this

3376
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840
out here. So this
 

3377
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,590
out here. So this
dimension D can actually change Right?

3378
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:03,600
dimension D can actually change Right?
 

3379
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,270
dimension D can actually change Right?
This doesn't have to be like I could

3380
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:05,280
This doesn't have to be like I could
 

3381
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,630
This doesn't have to be like I could
have this be longer, this could be

3382
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:06,640
have this be longer, this could be
 

3383
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,070
have this be longer, this could be
shorter. I could change this

3384
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:10,080
shorter. I could change this
 

3385
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,709
shorter. I could change this
while maintaining this n byn matrix

3386
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:12,719
while maintaining this n byn matrix
 

3387
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,550
while maintaining this n byn matrix
product that ends up here, right?

3388
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:14,560
product that ends up here, right?
 

3389
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,910
product that ends up here, right?
Because to be able to compute the

3390
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
Because to be able to compute the
 

3391
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,390
Because to be able to compute the
attention, I need one I need to have an

3392
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
attention, I need one I need to have an
 

3393
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,070
attention, I need one I need to have an
attention times values computation,

3394
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:20,080
attention times values computation,
 

3395
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,990
attention times values computation,
right? What's important here is to get

3396
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:22,000
right? What's important here is to get
 

3397
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,790
right? What's important here is to get
this n byn matrix here, but I can have a

3398
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:24,800
this n byn matrix here, but I can have a
 

3399
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,709
this n byn matrix here, but I can have a
different number of rows here and still

3400
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:26,719
different number of rows here and still
 

3401
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,630
different number of rows here and still
get the same n byn attention matrix out.

3402
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:30,640
get the same n byn attention matrix out.
 

3403
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,910
get the same n byn attention matrix out.
Okay? And so that's one observation that

3404
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:33,920
Okay? And so that's one observation that
 

3405
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,950
Okay? And so that's one observation that
then leads to um

3406
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:36,960
then leads to um
 

3407
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,310
then leads to um
this idea of multi head self attention.

3408
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:40,320
this idea of multi head self attention.
 

3409
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,709
this idea of multi head self attention.
Right? So we talked about self attent or

3410
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:44,719
Right? So we talked about self attent or
 

3411
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,590
Right? So we talked about self attent or
just multi head attention in general. We

3412
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:47,600
just multi head attention in general. We
 

3413
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,790
just multi head attention in general. We
talked about uh attention and we said we

3414
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:50,800
talked about uh attention and we said we
 

3415
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,510
talked about uh attention and we said we
want to know where to pay attention to.

3416
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:53,520
want to know where to pay attention to.
 

3417
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,550
want to know where to pay attention to.
We want to know what is the right

3418
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:54,560
We want to know what is the right
 

3419
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,149
We want to know what is the right
context.

3420
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159

 

3421
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,229

And we're doing this by learning a

3422
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,239
And we're doing this by learning a
 

3423
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:05,990
And we're doing this by learning a
particular uh you know WQ, W K and WV

3424
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:06,000
particular uh you know WQ, W K and WV
 

3425
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,669
particular uh you know WQ, W K and WV
which are telling us how to compute our

3426
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
which are telling us how to compute our
 

3427
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,430
which are telling us how to compute our
queries, how to compute our values, how

3428
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:09,440
queries, how to compute our values, how
 

3429
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,070
queries, how to compute our values, how
to compute our our keys.

3430
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:12,080
to compute our our keys.
 

3431
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:16,149
to compute our our keys.
Turns out that if you do this on in some

3432
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:16,159
Turns out that if you do this on in some
 

3433
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,990
Turns out that if you do this on in some
sense a channel, not a channel by

3434
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:18,000
sense a channel, not a channel by
 

3435
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,590
sense a channel, not a channel by
channel basis, but a group of channel

3436
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:19,600
channel basis, but a group of channel
 

3437
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,310
channel basis, but a group of channel
basis by group of channel basis,

3438
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:22,320
basis by group of channel basis,
 

3439
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,310
basis by group of channel basis,
you can do better. And now everything

3440
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:24,320
you can do better. And now everything
 

3441
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,390
you can do better. And now everything
basically uses this multi-head attention

3442
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:26,400
basically uses this multi-head attention
 

3443
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,310
basically uses this multi-head attention
idea. And so what we're doing here

3444
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,320
idea. And so what we're doing here
 

3445
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,709
idea. And so what we're doing here
is I'm taking my input and I'm saying

3446
01:20:32,709 --> 01:20:32,719
is I'm taking my input and I'm saying
 

3447
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:35,189
is I'm taking my input and I'm saying
let me look at this like let me look at

3448
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:35,199
let me look at this like let me look at
 

3449
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,950
let me look at this like let me look at
these channels and these channels and

3450
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:36,960
these channels and these channels and
 

3451
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,910
these channels and these channels and
these channels and I'm going to process

3452
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:39,920
these channels and I'm going to process
 

3453
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,229
these channels and I'm going to process
all of them through different attention

3454
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:42,239
all of them through different attention
 

3455
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:47,350
all of them through different attention
heads. Okay. So instead of this being D,

3456
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,360
heads. Okay. So instead of this being D,
 

3457
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,229
heads. Okay. So instead of this being D,
I'm going to have this be D over H.

3458
01:20:50,229 --> 01:20:50,239
I'm going to have this be D over H.
 

3459
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,550
I'm going to have this be D over H.
Everyone see that?

3460
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:52,560
Everyone see that?
 

3461
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,510
Everyone see that?
I still get an N byN attention matrix

3462
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:55,520
I still get an N byN attention matrix
 

3463
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,510
I still get an N byN attention matrix
out here.

3464
01:20:59,510 --> 01:20:59,520

 

3465
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,870

But what I've done now is I get this for

3466
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:02,880
But what I've done now is I get this for
 

3467
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,310
But what I've done now is I get this for
maybe just some part of the input

3468
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:06,320
maybe just some part of the input
 

3469
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,390
maybe just some part of the input
and then I concatenate all of these

3470
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:08,400
and then I concatenate all of these
 

3471
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,750
and then I concatenate all of these
again at the output to get d-dimensional

3472
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
again at the output to get d-dimensional
 

3473
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,070
again at the output to get d-dimensional
things.

3474
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,080
things.
 

3475
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,390
things.
So I'm looking at things I'm not looking

3476
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:16,400
So I'm looking at things I'm not looking
 

3477
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,910
So I'm looking at things I'm not looking
at things channel by channel. It's not

3478
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:17,920
at things channel by channel. It's not
 

3479
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,270
at things channel by channel. It's not
just one at a time, but I'm looking like

3480
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280
just one at a time, but I'm looking like
 

3481
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:22,390
just one at a time, but I'm looking like
basically at a group of channels

3482
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:22,400
basically at a group of channels
 

3483
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,189
basically at a group of channels
and allowing for this different pathways

3484
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:25,199
and allowing for this different pathways
 

3485

to uh look, one reason that this seems
 

3487
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,870
to uh look, one reason that this seems
to work better is maybe it allows for

to work better is maybe it allows for
 

3489
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,270
to work better is maybe it allows for
different different initializations help

different different initializations help
 

3491
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,870
different different initializations help
you be better, but it's also that you

3492
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:34,880
you be better, but it's also that you
 

3493
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,310
you be better, but it's also that you
can have different pathways for

3494
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:36,320
can have different pathways for
 

3495
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,270
can have different pathways for
different information and different

different information and different
 

3497
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,669
different information and different
channels can capture different things.
