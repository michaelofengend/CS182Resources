that all great ideas are simple. Good

166
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
that all great ideas are simple. Good
 

167
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,550
that all great ideas are simple. Good
ideas are complicated.

168
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
ideas are complicated.
 

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,749
ideas are complicated.
So what we are going to try and do in

170
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
So what we are going to try and do in
 

171
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,629
So what we are going to try and do in
this class is going to try and take

172
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
this class is going to try and take
 

173
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,350
this class is going to try and take
these you know ideas that have

174
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
these you know ideas that have
 

175
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,430
these you know ideas that have
complications that have lots and lots of

176
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
complications that have lots and lots of
 

177
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,189
complications that have lots and lots of
nuances and try to present to you the

178
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
nuances and try to present to you the
 

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,390
nuances and try to present to you the
simplest cleanest most aesthetically

180
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
simplest cleanest most aesthetically
 

181
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,029
simplest cleanest most aesthetically
pleasing version that you can use to

182
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
pleasing version that you can use to
 

183
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,830
pleasing version that you can use to
solidify your understanding that will

184
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
solidify your understanding that will
 

185
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,150
solidify your understanding that will
then help you actually you know get

186
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
then help you actually you know get
 

187
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,909
then help you actually you know get
further in the field. So this is going

188
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
further in the field. So this is going
 

189
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,830
further in the field. So this is going
to be a class that is going to have a a

190
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
to be a class that is going to have a a
 

191
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,189
to be a class that is going to have a a
mix of uh a lot of mathematics as well

192
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
mix of uh a lot of mathematics as well
 

193
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,950
mix of uh a lot of mathematics as well
as a lot of uh programming and to be

194
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
as a lot of uh programming and to be
 

195
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,350
as a lot of uh programming and to be
able to see the simplicity and the

196
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
able to see the simplicity and the
 

197
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,749
able to see the simplicity and the
beauty in many of these ideas. We are

198
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
beauty in many of these ideas. We are
 

199
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,230
beauty in many of these ideas. We are
going to be relying on the fact that you

200
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
going to be relying on the fact that you
 

201
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,670
going to be relying on the fact that you
have taken and have a good handle and

202
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
have taken and have a good handle and
 

203
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,309
have taken and have a good handle and
understanding of elegant and powerful

204
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
understanding of elegant and powerful
 

205
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,710
understanding of elegant and powerful
mathematical tools because things are

206
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
mathematical tools because things are
 

207
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,790
mathematical tools because things are
simple when they're looked at in the

208
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
simple when they're looked at in the
 

209
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,029
simple when they're looked at in the
right language and with the light right

210
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
right language and with the light right
 

211
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,270
right language and with the light right
perspective right we know this from the

212
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
perspective right we know this from the
 

213
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,430
perspective right we know this from the
SVD when you project into the right

214
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
SVD when you project into the right
 

215
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,589
SVD when you project into the right
coordinates things become simple and

216
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
coordinates things become simple and
 

217
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,550
coordinates things become simple and
clear so that's the aesthetic that we

218
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
clear so that's the aesthetic that we
 

219
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,870
clear so that's the aesthetic that we
will be taking and so uh we'll talk more

220
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
will be taking and so uh we'll talk more
 

221
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,550
will be taking and so uh we'll talk more
about the prerequisites but that's

222
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
about the prerequisites but that's
 

223
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,870
about the prerequisites but that's
something that I would like you to uh

224
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
something that I would like you to uh
 

225
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,230
something that I would like you to uh
like you to keep in mind.

226
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
like you to keep in mind.
 

227
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,029
like you to keep in mind.

231
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,110
been teaching here um but for longer. Um
but I I've taught this class a few times

232
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
but I I've taught this class a few times
 

233
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,029
but I I've taught this class a few times
uh in the past. Uh so um we've learned a

234
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
uh in the past. Uh so um we've learned a
 

235
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,350
uh in the past. Uh so um we've learned a
lot and hopefully you will get be the

236
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
lot and hopefully you will get be the
 

237
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,029
lot and hopefully you will get be the
beneficiaries of that learning.

238
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
beneficiaries of that learning.
 

239
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,390
beneficiaries of that learning.
>> Yeah, it's my first time teaching the

240
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
>> Yeah, it's my first time teaching the
 

241
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,629
>> Yeah, it's my first time teaching the
class. I should should announce that.

242
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
class. I should should announce that.
 

243
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,350
class. I should should announce that.
Um, we will have office hours uh right

244
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
Um, we will have office hours uh right
 

245
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,830
Um, we will have office hours uh right
after class in 400 Corey. So, we can

246
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
after class in 400 Corey. So, we can
 

247
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,749
after class in 400 Corey. So, we can
kind of all walk over together to that

Finally, we will be uh using we will not

282
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
Finally, we will be uh using we will not
 

283
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,670
Finally, we will be uh using we will not
really be using this textbook per se,

284
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
really be using this textbook per se,
 

285
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,470
really be using this textbook per se,
but if you want a textbook, this is the

286
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
but if you want a textbook, this is the
 

287
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,470
but if you want a textbook, this is the
textbook that we recommend. It's a very

288
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
textbook that we recommend. It's a very
 

289
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,670
textbook that we recommend. It's a very
recent textbook uh by Simon Prince.

290
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
recent textbook uh by Simon Prince.
 

291
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,829
recent textbook uh by Simon Prince.
There's are many many things that are

292
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
There's are many many things that are
 

293
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,910
There's are many many things that are
very elegantly done in this textbook.

294
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:53,920
very elegantly done in this textbook.
 

295
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,790
very elegantly done in this textbook.
So, um I I recommend you look at it.

296
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
So, um I I recommend you look at it.
 

297
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,310
So, um I I recommend you look at it.
There's also many things that we will be

298
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
There's also many things that we will be
 

299
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,910
There's also many things that we will be
doing that are not addressed in this

300
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
doing that are not addressed in this
 

301
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,070
doing that are not addressed in this
textbook. We're going to try to bring to

302
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
textbook. We're going to try to bring to
 

303
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,110
textbook. We're going to try to bring to
you some of the you know most recent

304
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
you some of the you know most recent
 

305
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,829
you some of the you know most recent
advances in the field um and digest

306
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
advances in the field um and digest
 

307
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,790
advances in the field um and digest
papers uh and share them with you. So

308
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
papers uh and share them with you. So
 

309
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,230
papers uh and share them with you. So
there will be things that are covered in

310
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
there will be things that are covered in
 

311
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,590
there will be things that are covered in
the class that are not in this textbook.

312
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
the class that are not in this textbook.
 

313
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,829
the class that are not in this textbook.
So it's not that um it's not a onetoone

314
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
So it's not that um it's not a onetoone
 

315
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,190
So it's not that um it's not a onetoone
mapping but this is a good reference.

316
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
mapping but this is a good reference.
 

317
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,150
mapping but this is a good reference.
Okay. Now about the elephant in the room

318
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
Okay. Now about the elephant in the room
 

319
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,829
Okay. Now about the elephant in the room
enrollment.

320
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839

529
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,629
Okay, so uh, back to how to get help.
Basically, we are your resources. As you

530
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
Basically, we are your resources. As you
 

531
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,470
Basically, we are your resources. As you
can see, there are more of you than

532
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
can see, there are more of you than
 

533
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,389
can see, there are more of you than
there are of us. It is actually a

534
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
there are of us. It is actually a
 

535
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,230
there are of us. It is actually a
particularly low staffed semester, so we

536
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,240
particularly low staffed semester, so we
 

537
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,750
particularly low staffed semester, so we
will do our best to try and help you. Um

538
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
will do our best to try and help you. Um
 

539
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,910
will do our best to try and help you. Um
but realize that there's just a limit to

540
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
but realize that there's just a limit to
 

541
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,150
but realize that there's just a limit to
what we can do with the with the volume

542
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
what we can do with the with the volume
 

543
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,710
what we can do with the with the volume
in this class. So that what that means

544
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
in this class. So that what that means
 

545
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,269
in this class. So that what that means
is that it is really really important

546
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:07,279
is that it is really really important
 

547
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,069
is that it is really really important
that you form study groups and work

548
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
that you form study groups and work
 

549
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,030
that you form study groups and work
together with each other to hold each

550
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
together with each other to hold each
 

551
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,790
together with each other to hold each
other accountable to doing things like

552
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:14,800
other accountable to doing things like
 

553
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,629
other accountable to doing things like
coming to lecture. I know for those of

554
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,829
teach everyone.
>> Great.

636
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839

 

637
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,670

Okay.

638
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
Okay.
 

639
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,910
Okay.
If you have private questions that are

640
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
If you have private questions that are
 

641
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,829
If you have private questions that are
not suitable for ed, you may email the

642
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
not suitable for ed, you may email the
 

643
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,389
not suitable for ed, you may email the
uh faculty to be able to get a response,

644
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
uh faculty to be able to get a response,
 

645
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,150
uh faculty to be able to get a response,
but know that ED is probably the fastest

646
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
but know that ED is probably the fastest
 

647
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,670
but know that ED is probably the fastest
way to get a response. Our emails are

648
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
way to get a response. Our emails are
 

649
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,910
way to get a response. Our emails are
often flooded, but we make time to go to

650
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
often flooded, but we make time to go to
 

651
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,150
often flooded, but we make time to go to
Ed to respond to questions. Um, and if

652
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
Ed to respond to questions. Um, and if
 

653
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,910
Ed to respond to questions. Um, and if
you make a private post there, we will

654
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
you make a private post there, we will
 

655
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,069

quickly. I will apologize in advance

658
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
quickly. I will apologize in advance
 

659
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,590
quickly. I will apologize in advance
that we might write to you very very

660
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
that we might write to you very very
 

661
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,389
that we might write to you very very
short three-word emails. That is not

662
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
short three-word emails. That is not
 

663
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,470
short three-word emails. That is not
because we are trying to be rude. It is

664
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
because we are trying to be rude. It is
 

665
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,230
because we are trying to be rude. It is
simply because we are trying to reply to

666
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
simply because we are trying to reply to
 

667
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,069
simply because we are trying to reply to
all of the questions we have received. I

668
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
all of the questions we have received. I
 

669
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,629
all of the questions we have received. I
would rather reply to everyone shortly

670
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
would rather reply to everyone shortly
 

671
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,550
would rather reply to everyone shortly
than write a long paragraph to one

672
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
than write a long paragraph to one
 

673
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,550
than write a long paragraph to one
person and not reply to the other 10.

674
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
person and not reply to the other 10.
 

675
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,590
person and not reply to the other 10.
Okay? So, we are really not trying to be

676
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
Okay? So, we are really not trying to be
 

677
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,189
Okay? So, we are really not trying to be
curt or rude when we write short emails

678
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
curt or rude when we write short emails
 

679
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,509
curt or rude when we write short emails
to you. Okay. Great. Accommodations. Um,

00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
to us as as you uh as needed. Homework
 

691
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,230
to us as as you uh as needed. Homework
extensions in this class will

692
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
extensions in this class will
 

693
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,990
extensions in this class will
essentially be automatic if you need

694
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
essentially be automatic if you need
 

695
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,949
essentially be automatic if you need
them. Um, project extensions which we

696
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:02,959
them. Um, project extensions which we
 

697
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,630
them. Um, project extensions which we
will talk about we will not be able to

698
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
will talk about we will not be able to
 

699
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,230
will talk about we will not be able to
offer simply because the project will be

700
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
offer simply because the project will be
 

701
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,630
offer simply because the project will be
due at the end of the semester and then

702
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
due at the end of the semester and then
 

703
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,829
due at the end of the semester and then
we have to submit uh final grades. So,

704
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
we have to submit uh final grades. So,
 

705
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,350
we have to submit uh final grades. So,
uh, there'll be a long period of time

706
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
uh, there'll be a long period of time
 

707
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,350
uh, there'll be a long period of time
for you to do the project. So, we will

708
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
for you to do the project. So, we will
 

709
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,110
for you to do the project. So, we will
not be really offering extensions on the

710
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
not be really offering extensions on the
 

711
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,270
not be really offering extensions on the
project.

712
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
project.
 

713
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,789
project.
Now, on to the grading details, the

714
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
Now, on to the grading details, the
 

715
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,750
Now, on to the grading details, the
nitty-gritty.

716
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
nitty-gritty.
 

717
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,510
nitty-gritty.
There are two big components in this

718
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
There are two big components in this
 

719
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,429
There are two big components in this
class. It is the final exam and the

720
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
class. It is the final exam and the
 

721
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,950
class. It is the final exam and the
project. The homework will nominally be

722
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
project. The homework will nominally be
 

723
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,470
project. The homework will nominally be
worth 0% in the class, which means that

724
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
worth 0% in the class, which means that
 

725
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,470
worth 0% in the class, which means that
the actual submissions are not going to

726
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
the actual submissions are not going to
 

727
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,070
the actual submissions are not going to
be graded. We have only one gsi.

728
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
be graded. We have only one gsi.
 

729
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,230
be graded. We have only one gsi.
So it's simply not reason uh not

730
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
So it's simply not reason uh not
 

731
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,070
So it's simply not reason uh not
feasible. We have we we don't have the

732
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
feasible. We have we we don't have the
 

733
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,110
feasible. We have we we don't have the
bandwidth. And in the era of LLMs, what

734
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
bandwidth. And in the era of LLMs, what
 

735
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,710
bandwidth. And in the era of LLMs, what
we want to do is we want to really

736
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
we want to do is we want to really
 

737
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,230
we want to do is we want to really
encourage you to focus on learning the

738
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
encourage you to focus on learning the
 

739
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,710
encourage you to focus on learning the
material. I think an put it really well

740
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720
material. I think an put it really well
 

741
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,789
material. I think an put it really well
that you know using an LLM to do your

742
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
that you know using an LLM to do your
 

743
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,350
that you know using an LLM to do your
homework is the equivalent of instead of

744
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
homework is the equivalent of instead of
 

745
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,950
homework is the equivalent of instead of
going for a run around the block, you

746
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
going for a run around the block, you
 

747
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,669
going for a run around the block, you
drive around the block. The point is the

748
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
drive around the block. The point is the
 

749
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,270
drive around the block. The point is the
workout. The point is not the

750
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
workout. The point is not the
 

751
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,270
workout. The point is not the
destination. Okay? So doing the work is

752
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
destination. Okay? So doing the work is
 

753
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,350
destination. Okay? So doing the work is
what is going to help you learn, not

754
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
what is going to help you learn, not
 

755
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,270
what is going to help you learn, not
writing the answer in a box. And so the

756
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
writing the answer in a box. And so the
 

757
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,110
writing the answer in a box. And so the
whole point is to encourage you to do

758
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,120
whole point is to encourage you to do
 

759
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,029
whole point is to encourage you to do
the work. So we are not going to be

760
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:21,039
the work. So we are not going to be
 

761
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,070
the work. So we are not going to be
really checking if you do the work. We

762
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
really checking if you do the work. We
 

763
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,909
really checking if you do the work. We
will in the event that there's a you

764
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
will in the event that there's a you
 

765
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,070
will in the event that there's a you
know boundary case on your grade. You're

766
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
know boundary case on your grade. You're
 

767
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,270
know boundary case on your grade. You're
extremely near some boundary. we may we

768
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
extremely near some boundary. we may we
 

769
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,190
extremely near some boundary. we may we
may choose to go back and look at the

770
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
may choose to go back and look at the
 

771
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,750
may choose to go back and look at the
homework and see if you know this is

772
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
homework and see if you know this is
 

773
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,430
homework and see if you know this is
some this is a case where we want to

774
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
some this is a case where we want to
 

775
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,909
some this is a case where we want to
make some kind of exception. Um however

776
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
make some kind of exception. Um however
 

777
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,549
make some kind of exception. Um however
in general the homework will uh not be

778
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:42,559
in general the homework will uh not be
 

779
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,510
in general the homework will uh not be
looked at. So

780
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,520
looked at. So
 

781
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,390
looked at. So
um 60% of the class will be the uh final

782
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,400
um 60% of the class will be the uh final
 

783
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,350
um 60% of the class will be the uh final
exam 25% is the project and 15% is

784
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360
exam 25% is the project and 15% is
 

785
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,710
exam 25% is the project and 15% is
participation which we will talk about

786
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
participation which we will talk about
 

787
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,150
participation which we will talk about
in a minute. Both the final exam and the

788
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
in a minute. Both the final exam and the
 

789
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,549
in a minute. Both the final exam and the
project have a gating effect. What does

790
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
project have a gating effect. What does
 

791
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,789
project have a gating effect. What does
that mean? It means that if you fail the

792
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
that mean? It means that if you fail the
 

793
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,070
that mean? It means that if you fail the
final, you fail the class. You can't

794
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
final, you fail the class. You can't
 

795
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,150
final, you fail the class. You can't
have an outstanding project but fail the

796
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
have an outstanding project but fail the
 

797
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,549
have an outstanding project but fail the
final and pass the class. Similarly, if

798
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
final and pass the class. Similarly, if
 

799
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,549
final and pass the class. Similarly, if
you fail the project, even if you have a

800
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
you fail the project, even if you have a
 

801
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,990
you fail the project, even if you have a
perfect score on the final, you will um

802
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
perfect score on the final, you will um
 

803
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,710
perfect score on the final, you will um
fail the class. The key reason for doing

804
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
fail the class. The key reason for doing
 

805
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,270
fail the class. The key reason for doing
this is to prevent free writing on the

806
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,280
this is to prevent free writing on the
 

807
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,070
this is to prevent free writing on the
project because we do not want to have

808
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
project because we do not want to have
 

809
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,630
project because we do not want to have
situations where we have groups of four

810
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
situations where we have groups of four
 

811
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,510
situations where we have groups of four
students and only one of them or two of

812
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
students and only one of them or two of
 

813
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,350
students and only one of them or two of
them are doing the work and the other

814
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
them are doing the work and the other
 

815
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,750
them are doing the work and the other
people are not doing the work. So it is

816
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
people are not doing the work. So it is
 

817
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,990
people are not doing the work. So it is
essential that you keep up with the

818
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
essential that you keep up with the
 

819
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,990
essential that you keep up with the
class and do the work because the way to

820
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
class and do the work because the way to
 

821
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,510
class and do the work because the way to
do well on the project and be able to

822
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
do well on the project and be able to
 

823
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,430
do well on the project and be able to
participate fully is to make sure that

824
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
participate fully is to make sure that
 

825
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,549
participate fully is to make sure that
you know the material doing the

826
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
you know the material doing the
 

827
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,029
you know the material doing the
homeworks doing the the you know

828
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:45,039
homeworks doing the the you know
 

829
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:45,669
homeworks doing the the you know
>> discussion

830
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
>> discussion
 

831
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,430
>> discussion
>> the doing the discussion sections. So

832
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
>> the doing the discussion sections. So
 

833
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,990
>> the doing the discussion sections. So
this is all uh critical. There will be

834
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
this is all uh critical. There will be
 

835
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,430
this is all uh critical. There will be
no curve in the class. You are not

836
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
no curve in the class. You are not
 

837
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,630
no curve in the class. You are not
competing with each other. We have

838
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
competing with each other. We have
 

839
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,310
competing with each other. We have
already published the bins to the

840
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,320
already published the bins to the
 

841
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,230
already published the bins to the
website. These will be the bins that

842
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
website. These will be the bins that
 

843
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,789
website. These will be the bins that
will be used for grading the exam.

844
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
will be used for grading the exam.
 

845
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,669
will be used for grading the exam.
>> The whole class.

846
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
>> The whole class.
 

847
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,750
>> The whole class.
>> Uh the exam and the whole class. Yes.

848
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
>> Uh the exam and the whole class. Yes.
 

849
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,230
>> Uh the exam and the whole class. Yes.
Okay. So, homework policies. There's a

850
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
Okay. So, homework policies. There's a
 

851
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,070
Okay. So, homework policies. There's a
grade scope code. You might want to

852
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
grade scope code. You might want to
 

853
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,470
grade scope code. You might want to
write this down. It's on the website,

854
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:10,480
write this down. It's on the website,
 

855
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,270
write this down. It's on the website,
too. Even if you don't write it out, um,

856
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,280
too. Even if you don't write it out, um,
 

857
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,110
too. Even if you don't write it out, um,
please join Grade Scope. You have to

858
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
please join Grade Scope. You have to
 

859
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,510
please join Grade Scope. You have to
submit homework zero there. Remember,

860
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:17,520
submit homework zero there. Remember,
 

861
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,950
submit homework zero there. Remember,
there will be weekly homeworks. They

862
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
there will be weekly homeworks. They
 

863
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,669
there will be weekly homeworks. They
will do will be due every Friday night.

864
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
will do will be due every Friday night.
 

865
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,830
will do will be due every Friday night.
The grade scope deadline will be set to

866
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
The grade scope deadline will be set to
 

867
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,909
The grade scope deadline will be set to
the end of the semester. So, the last

868
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
the end of the semester. So, the last
 

869
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,669
the end of the semester. So, the last
week of semester will be what the grade

870
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
week of semester will be what the grade
 

871
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,909
week of semester will be what the grade
scope deadline will be will be set to.

872
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
scope deadline will be will be set to.
 

873
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,070
scope deadline will be will be set to.
So you can technically submit the the

874
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,080
So you can technically submit the the
 

875
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,950
So you can technically submit the the
the homework after but the deadline is

876
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:34,960
the homework after but the deadline is
 

877
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,190
the homework after but the deadline is
Friday night. Okay, does that make

878
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:37,200
Friday night. Okay, does that make
 

879
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,430
Friday night. Okay, does that make
sense? So that means that if you have a

880
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
sense? So that means that if you have a
 

881
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,669
sense? So that means that if you have a
need for an extension, take the

882
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:41,679
need for an extension, take the
 

883
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,590
need for an extension, take the
extension, but know that you are taking

884
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:43,600
extension, but know that you are taking
 

885
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,270
extension, but know that you are taking
an extension and know that that means

886
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
an extension and know that that means
 

887
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,310
an extension and know that that means
that you are accepting the

888
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
that you are accepting the
 

889
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,669
that you are accepting the
responsibilities that come with that

890
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:47,679
responsibilities that come with that
 

891
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,230
responsibilities that come with that
extension.

892
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
extension.
 

893
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,070
extension.
So we strongly recommend keeping up. I

894
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080
So we strongly recommend keeping up. I
 

895
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,029
So we strongly recommend keeping up. I
already talked about creating

896
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
already talked about creating
 

897
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,110
already talked about creating
accountability through a study group.

898
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
accountability through a study group.
 

899
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,950
accountability through a study group.
Um, we already talked about the homework

900
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
Um, we already talked about the homework
 

901
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,470
Um, we already talked about the homework
being 0% and we may look at a random

902
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480
being 0% and we may look at a random
 

903
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,750
being 0% and we may look at a random
subset of your homework if you're close

904
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:01,760
subset of your homework if you're close
 

905
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,789
subset of your homework if you're close
to a grade boundary.

906
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:04,799
to a grade boundary.
 

907
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,390
to a grade boundary.
Finally, doing the homework is really

908
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
Finally, doing the homework is really
 

909
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,950
Finally, doing the homework is really
the best way to learn the material. Um,

910
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:08,960
the best way to learn the material. Um,
 

911
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,630
the best way to learn the material. Um,
historically, if you look at the exams,

912
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
historically, if you look at the exams,
 

913
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,990
historically, if you look at the exams,
there have often been questions on the

914
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
there have often been questions on the
 

915
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,990
there have often been questions on the
exams that are very, very similar to

916
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000
exams that are very, very similar to
 

917
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,909
exams that are very, very similar to
homework questions or build on the

918
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:15,919
homework questions or build on the
 

919
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,350
homework questions or build on the
concepts that have been talked about in

920
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,360
concepts that have been talked about in
 

921
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,350
concepts that have been talked about in
the homework questions.

922
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
the homework questions.
 

923
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,870
the homework questions.
Okay, let me pass to Anand.

924
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
Okay, let me pass to Anand.
 

925
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,510
Okay, let me pass to Anand.
>> Great. Um so let's just talk a little

926
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
>> Great. Um so let's just talk a little
 

927
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,310
>> Great. Um so let's just talk a little
bit about the um background we expect.

928
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
bit about the um background we expect.
 

929
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,110
bit about the um background we expect.
So this is 2025. Um it's not uh 2015 or

930
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,120
So this is 2025. Um it's not uh 2015 or
 

931
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,990
So this is 2025. Um it's not uh 2015 or
2013 or sometime in the past. We

932
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,000
2013 or sometime in the past. We
 

933
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,590
2013 or sometime in the past. We
understand a lot and to give you the

934
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,600
understand a lot and to give you the
 

935
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,270
understand a lot and to give you the
best deep learning class we are going to

936
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,280
best deep learning class we are going to
 

937
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,830
best deep learning class we are going to
try to use and get you to the edge of

938
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:41,840
try to use and get you to the edge of
 

939
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,310
try to use and get you to the edge of
understanding that we that we have. So

940
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320
understanding that we that we have. So
 

941
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,029
understanding that we that we have. So
we expect uh a mastery of machine

942
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
we expect uh a mastery of machine
 

943
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,430
we expect uh a mastery of machine
learning at the level of 189 and or and

944
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
learning at the level of 189 and or and
 

945
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,590
learning at the level of 189 and or and
or stat 154.

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
or stat 154.
 

947
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,590
or stat 154.
We will not be reviewing we'll set

948
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600
We will not be reviewing we'll set
 

949
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,029
We will not be reviewing we'll set
notation but we're not going to retach

950
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:55,039
notation but we're not going to retach
 

951
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,470
notation but we're not going to retach
you basic machine learning. We're going

952
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,480
you basic machine learning. We're going
 

953
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,510
you basic machine learning. We're going
to need it um to to build on. We expect

954
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
to need it um to to build on. We expect
 

955
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,870
to need it um to to build on. We expect
a mastery of linear algebra and

956
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
a mastery of linear algebra and
 

957
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,789
a mastery of linear algebra and
optimization at the level of x127 to27a.

958
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799
optimization at the level of x127 to27a.
 

959
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,350
optimization at the level of x127 to27a.
Um we are absolutely going to be needing

960
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,360
Um we are absolutely going to be needing
 

961
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,590
Um we are absolutely going to be needing
optimization is the workhorse uh for

962
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
optimization is the workhorse uh for
 

963
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,430
optimization is the workhorse uh for
doing modern deep learning. So we're

964
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
doing modern deep learning. So we're
 

965
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,230
doing modern deep learning. So we're
going to need you to know that and have

966
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,240
going to need you to know that and have
 

967
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,470
going to need you to know that and have
facility with doing the manipulations.

968
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
facility with doing the manipulations.
 

969
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,549
facility with doing the manipulations.
um we'll need probability um at the

970
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
um we'll need probability um at the
 

971
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,590
um we'll need probability um at the
level of 126 or data 140 or stat 134. Um

972
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
level of 126 or data 140 or stat 134. Um
 

973
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,350
level of 126 or data 140 or stat 134. Um
probability is the language we use to

974
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,360
probability is the language we use to
 

975
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,110
probability is the language we use to
talk about things like generalization

976
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,120
talk about things like generalization
 

977
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,950
talk about things like generalization
and a lot of intuition and principles

978
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:30,960
and a lot of intuition and principles
 

979
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,789
and a lot of intuition and principles
behind which the algorithms and the

980
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
behind which the algorithms and the
 

981
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,230
behind which the algorithms and the
approaches are designed come from

982
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
approaches are designed come from
 

983
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,750
approaches are designed come from
probabistic reasoning. If you don't have

984
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
probabistic reasoning. If you don't have
 

985
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,470
probabistic reasoning. If you don't have
a deep familiarity with that, you won't

986
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,480
a deep familiarity with that, you won't
 

987
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,789
a deep familiarity with that, you won't
understand it. So we require it. We're

988
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
understand it. So we require it. We're
 

989
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,190
understand it. So we require it. We're
not going to teach you probability.

990
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
not going to teach you probability.
 

991
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,789
not going to teach you probability.
Um what does this mean? Uh it means that

992
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:46,799
Um what does this mean? Uh it means that
 

993
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,830
Um what does this mean? Uh it means that
when you say we're not going to teach

994
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:47,840
when you say we're not going to teach
 

995
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,110
when you say we're not going to teach
it, we're not going to teach it to you

996
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120
it, we're not going to teach it to you
 

997
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,390
it, we're not going to teach it to you
in lecture and we're not going to

998
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
in lecture and we're not going to
 

999
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,590
in lecture and we're not going to
support it in office hours. Um we're not

1000
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,600
support it in office hours. Um we're not
 

1001
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,710
support it in office hours. Um we're not
supporting it in any way. Uh so we'll

1002
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
supporting it in any way. Uh so we'll
 

1003
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,710
supporting it in any way. Uh so we'll
point you to stuff that you can read.

1004
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
point you to stuff that you can read.
 

1005
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,149
point you to stuff that you can read.
You can uh but you have to know it. You

1006
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
You can uh but you have to know it. You
 

1007
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,310
You can uh but you have to know it. You
saw the level of staffing we have. It's

1008
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
saw the level of staffing we have. It's
 

1009
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,789
saw the level of staffing we have. It's
not feasible for us to teach you

1010
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
not feasible for us to teach you
 

1011
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,430
not feasible for us to teach you
background material.

1012
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
background material.
 

1013
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,070
background material.
Um yeah and to get him if you just

1014
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
Um yeah and to get him if you just
 

1015
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,310
Um yeah and to get him if you just
wanted to learn about deep learning in a

1016
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
wanted to learn about deep learning in a
 

1017
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,669
wanted to learn about deep learning in a
cookbook manner um we strongly recommend

1018

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
you go and take advantage of the vast
 

1021
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,029
you go and take advantage of the vast
number of YouTube um resources and other

1022
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,039
number of YouTube um resources and other
 

1023
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,270
number of YouTube um resources and other
free resources out there that will give

1024
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:25,280
free resources out there that will give
 

1025
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,230
free resources out there that will give
you lots and lots of recipes and stuff

1026

you can use uh to do deep learning.
 

1029
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,669
you can use uh to do deep learning.
That's not this class. It's not the

1030
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:31,679
That's not this class. It's not the
 

1031
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,909
That's not this class. It's not the
point of a Berkeley class. So we expect

1032
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
point of a Berkeley class. So we expect
 

1033
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,669
point of a Berkeley class. So we expect
you here if you actually want to

1034
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
you here if you actually want to
 

1035
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,310
you here if you actually want to
understand and learn the material and to

1036
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
understand and learn the material and to
 

1037
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,390
understand and learn the material and to
the best of our ability. Okay.

1038
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,400
the best of our ability. Okay.
 

1039
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,870
the best of our ability. Okay.
So now you have a sense of um the

1040
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
So now you have a sense of um the
 

1041
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,310
So now you have a sense of um the
background we expect and we'll be

1042
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,320
background we expect and we'll be
 

1043
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,830
background we expect and we'll be
counting on let's talk about uh we've

1044
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:49,840
counting on let's talk about uh we've
 

1045
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,909
counting on let's talk about uh we've
seen about the homework. The homework

1046
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
seen about the homework. The homework
 

1047
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,990
seen about the homework. The homework
you know will have written questions

1048
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
you know will have written questions
 

1049

involving proofs and derivations and
 

1051
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,070
involving proofs and derivations and
things like this. We expect you to do

1052
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080
things like this. We expect you to do
 

1053
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,909
things like this. We expect you to do
them by hand. the exam you know will be

you and the exam um but the project is
 

1061
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,549
you and the exam um but the project is
different so a lot more details will be

1062
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
different so a lot more details will be
 

1063
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,549
different so a lot more details will be
announced on ed uh including all the

like that but key points are the project
 

1069
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,190
like that but key points are the project
is a group project again given the

is a group project again given the
 

1071
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,870
is a group project again given the
number of staffing we cannot support a

1072
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:22,880
number of staffing we cannot support a
 

1073
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,710
number of staffing we cannot support a
whole bunch of individual projects um

1074
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
whole bunch of individual projects um
 

1075
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,669
whole bunch of individual projects um
just don't have the resources uh groups

1076
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:27,679
just don't have the resources uh groups
 

1077
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,310
just don't have the resources uh groups
of four groups of four can mix and match

1078
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,320
of four groups of four can mix and match
 

1079
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,549
of four groups of four can mix and match
between undergrads and grad students. Um

between undergrads and grad students. Um
 

1081
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,230
between undergrads and grad students. Um
for the project itself, there will be a

1082
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,240
for the project itself, there will be a
 

1083
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,950
for the project itself, there will be a
few options. Uh each of the options will

1084
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
few options. Uh each of the options will
 

1085
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,110
few options. Uh each of the options will
be open-ended in that it will allow you

1086
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
be open-ended in that it will allow you
 

1087
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,350
be open-ended in that it will allow you
to get however far you want to get close

1088
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,360
to get however far you want to get close
 

1089
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,590
to get however far you want to get close
to the research frontier. Um and we'll

1090
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:43,600
to the research frontier. Um and we'll
 

1091
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,350
to the research frontier. Um and we'll
build on as well as build on published

1092
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,360
build on as well as build on published
 

1093

00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:47,279
papers to allow you to demonstrate your
 

1095
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,510
papers to allow you to demonstrate your
understanding of deep learning. The

1096

understanding of deep learning. The
 

1097
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,950
understanding of deep learning. The
project will require you to learn things

1098

project will require you to learn things
 

1099
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,390
project will require you to learn things
on your own that will not have been

1100
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,400
on your own that will not have been
 

1101
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,070
on your own that will not have been
covered in lecture because that's the

1102
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
covered in lecture because that's the
 

1103
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,149
covered in lecture because that's the
reality of the subject. Um however for

1104
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:58,159
reality of the subject. Um however for
 

1105
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,830
reality of the subject. Um however for
undergraduates taking the course as well

00:24:59,830 --> 00:24:59,840
undergraduates taking the course as well
 

1107
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,350
undergraduates taking the course as well
as graduate students from EEKES uh you

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,360
as graduate students from EEKES uh you
 

1109
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,950
as graduate students from EEKES uh you
will have to choose between the project

1110
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
will have to choose between the project
 

1111
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,909
will have to choose between the project
options we give you that will support um

1112
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
options we give you that will support um
 

1113
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,990
options we give you that will support um
there'll be room within them but they'll

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
there'll be room within them but they'll
 

1115
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,070
there'll be room within them but they'll
be bounded graduate students from

Um the reality of deep learning is that

1142
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:39,679
Um the reality of deep learning is that
 

1143
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,990
Um the reality of deep learning is that
you have to have uh use computers. Um so

1144
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,000
you have to have uh use computers. Um so
 

1145
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,870
you have to have uh use computers. Um so
uh we are trying to secure some compute

1146
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880
uh we are trying to secure some compute
 

1147
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,870
uh we are trying to secure some compute
resources for you and we have made some

1148
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:48,880
resources for you and we have made some
 

1149
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,950
resources for you and we have made some
partial progress in this direction.

1150
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:50,960
partial progress in this direction.
 

1151
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,110
partial progress in this direction.
However the compute resources we are

1152
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,120
However the compute resources we are
 

1153
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,390
However the compute resources we are
able to secure uh from wonderful

1154
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
able to secure uh from wonderful
 

1155
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,390
able to secure uh from wonderful
national level programs are are not

1156
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,400
national level programs are are not
 

1157
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,710
national level programs are are not
sufficient to actually enable all of you

1158
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:00,720
sufficient to actually enable all of you
 

1159
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,390
sufficient to actually enable all of you
to do the best projects that you might

1160
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
to do the best projects that you might
 

1161
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,470
to do the best projects that you might
want to do. Let's just be clear about

1162
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
want to do. Let's just be clear about
 

1163
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,830
want to do. Let's just be clear about
that. So uh you might need to bring your

1164
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:09,840
that. So uh you might need to bring your
 

1165
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,549
that. So uh you might need to bring your
own compute for your projects. uh to go

1166
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
own compute for your projects. uh to go
 

1167
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,990
own compute for your projects. uh to go
beyond. We'll try to make sure the

1168
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,000
beyond. We'll try to make sure the
 

1169
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,870
beyond. We'll try to make sure the
homeworks and all will can run within uh

1170
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:16,880
homeworks and all will can run within uh
 

1171
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,310
homeworks and all will can run within uh
collab uh free tier and what you can do

1172
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,320
collab uh free tier and what you can do
 

1173
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,870
collab uh free tier and what you can do
on your um modern laptops, but uh you

1174
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:24,880
on your um modern laptops, but uh you
 

1175
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,990
on your um modern laptops, but uh you
know even there there might be

1176
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,000
know even there there might be
 

1177
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,430
know even there there might be
explorations you want to do yourself

1178
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:27,440
explorations you want to do yourself
 

1179
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,549
explorations you want to do yourself
that go beyond. Um so we're going to

1180
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:30,559
that go beyond. Um so we're going to
 

1181
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,870
that go beyond. Um so we're going to
we'll try to get you resources but you

1182
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
we'll try to get you resources but you
 

1183
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,590
we'll try to get you resources but you
might need more.

1184
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:33,600
might need more.
 

1185
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,430
might need more.

um for uh understanding what it takes to
 

1223
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,549
um for uh understanding what it takes to
compete in the modern world. Um so the

1224
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
compete in the modern world. Um so the
 

1225
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,269
compete in the modern world. Um so the
project will involve um lots of work on

1226
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
project will involve um lots of work on
 

1227
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,789
project will involve um lots of work on
your part of course but you'll have to

1228
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:20,799
your part of course but you'll have to
 

1229
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,950
your part of course but you'll have to
submit proposals multiple levels. You'll

1230
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
submit proposals multiple levels. You'll
 

1231
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,269
submit proposals multiple levels. You'll
have meetings with uh us you'll have to

1232
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:25,279
have meetings with uh us you'll have to
 

1233
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,830
have meetings with uh us you'll have to
submit drafts. There will also be an

1234
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
submit drafts. There will also be an
 

1235
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,350
submit drafts. There will also be an
individual component of the project

1236
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:29,360
individual component of the project
 

1237
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,630
individual component of the project
that's not group which is you'll

1238
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:30,640
that's not group which is you'll
 

1239
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,230
that's not group which is you'll
individually have to participate in peer

1240
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
individually have to participate in peer
 

1241
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,789
individually have to participate in peer
review um of other people's submissions

1242
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:34,799
review um of other people's submissions
 

1243
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,710
review um of other people's submissions
and give detailed comments and feedback

1244
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:36,720
and give detailed comments and feedback
 

1245
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,070
and give detailed comments and feedback
so that everyone can do the best

1246
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,080
so that everyone can do the best
 

1247
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,750
so that everyone can do the best
projects by the end. It's also just a

1248
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:39,760
projects by the end. It's also just a
 

1249
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,350
projects by the end. It's also just a
part of life uh in this area. So your

1250
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,360
part of life uh in this area. So your
 

1251
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,950
part of life uh in this area. So your
actual grade on the project the entire

1252
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:44,960
actual grade on the project the entire
 

1253
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,789
actual grade on the project the entire
group will get one grade for the

1254
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:46,799
group will get one grade for the
 

1255
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,789
group will get one grade for the
technical material that they have done

1256
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
technical material that they have done
 

1257
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,350
technical material that they have done
and that will be modulated by your

1258
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:51,360
and that will be modulated by your
 

1259
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,789
and that will be modulated by your
individual performance as a peer

1260
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799
individual performance as a peer
 

1261
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,269
individual performance as a peer
reviewer to get your grade. So if you do

1262
00:27:55,269 --> 00:27:55,279
reviewer to get your grade. So if you do
 

1263
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,149
reviewer to get your grade. So if you do
a really bad job as a peer reviewer for

1264
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
a really bad job as a peer reviewer for
 

1265
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,630
a really bad job as a peer reviewer for
example not doing your reviews then you

1266
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
example not doing your reviews then you
 

1267
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,190
example not doing your reviews then you
will get a zero on the project because

1268
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,200
will get a zero on the project because
 

1269
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,710
will get a zero on the project because
the zero will multiply even your

1270
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,720
the zero will multiply even your
 

1271
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,269
the zero will multiply even your
spectacular the project. Okay. So, you

1272
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:07,279
spectacular the project. Okay. So, you
 

1273
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,110
spectacular the project. Okay. So, you
have to do all the work. Basic

expect four at least special
 

1363
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,310
expect four at least special
contributions. We'll put more details

1364
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
contributions. We'll put more details
 

1365
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,510
contributions. We'll put more details
about this on the in the ed forum, but

1366
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
about this on the in the ed forum, but
 

1367
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,870
about this on the in the ed forum, but
these are things that you can do that

1368
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:02,880
these are things that you can do that
 

1369
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,389
these are things that you can do that
involve a little bit more work that make

1370
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
involve a little bit more work that make
 

1371
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,950
involve a little bit more work that make
the class better for everyone. Um, that

1372

also actively engage your learning in a
 

1375
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,029
also actively engage your learning in a
more detailed way. So, one of one of

1376
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:13,039
more detailed way. So, one of one of
 

1377
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,070
more detailed way. So, one of one of
them, one option is going to be

1378
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,080
them, one option is going to be
 

1379
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,870
them, one option is going to be
take one of the modern LLMs. you will

1380
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,880
take one of the modern LLMs. you will
 

1381
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,149
take one of the modern LLMs. you will
have a we'll have a sign up way for you

1382
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:20,159
have a we'll have a sign up way for you
 

1383
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,590
have a we'll have a sign up way for you
to sign up so you don't hit lots of

1384
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,600
to sign up so you don't hit lots of
 

1385
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,149
to sign up so you don't hit lots of
overlapping things. So for example go to

1386
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:24,159
overlapping things. So for example go to
 

1387
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,310
overlapping things. So for example go to
Gemini and say okay Gemini I'm going to

1388
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,320
Gemini and say okay Gemini I'm going to
 

1389
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,430
Gemini and say okay Gemini I'm going to
use Gemini to solve the homework

1390
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
use Gemini to solve the homework
 

1391
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,310
use Gemini to solve the homework
and we'll record a trace we'll put put

1392
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:34,320
and we'll record a trace we'll put put
 

1393
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,470
and we'll record a trace we'll put put
details about this record a trace of you

1394
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
details about this record a trace of you
 

1395
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,870
details about this record a trace of you
interacting with Gemini as watching how

1396
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
interacting with Gemini as watching how
 

1397
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,830
interacting with Gemini as watching how
Gemini solves the homework problems okay

1398
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840
Gemini solves the homework problems okay
 

1399
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,350
Gemini solves the homework problems okay
we will expect you to then annotate that

1400
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,360
we will expect you to then annotate that
 

1401
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,230
we will expect you to then annotate that
trace with your own comments critique it

trace with your own comments critique it
 

1403
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,750
trace with your own comments critique it
um sometimes Gemini will oneshot the

1404
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:47,760
um sometimes Gemini will oneshot the
 

1405
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,590
um sometimes Gemini will oneshot the
problem for example but sometimes it

1406
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:49,600
problem for example but sometimes it
 

1407
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,190
problem for example but sometimes it
won't um so engage see what's going on

1408
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
won't um so engage see what's going on
 

1409
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,669
won't um so engage see what's going on
and give us a report on what happens.

1410
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
and give us a report on what happens.
 

1411
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,110
and give us a report on what happens.
You must do this at at most once. So you

1412
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,120
You must do this at at most once. So you
 

1413
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,430
You must do this at at most once. So you
can't do all four of this. There are

1414
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,440
can't do all four of this. There are
 

1415
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,669
can't do all four of this. There are
going to be three other choices. One of

1416
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:03,679
going to be three other choices. One of
 

1417
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,710
going to be three other choices. One of
which is uh so I I didn't finish making

1418
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
which is uh so I I didn't finish making
 

1419
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,350
which is uh so I I didn't finish making
the slide. Uh so

1420
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:09,360
the slide. Uh so
 

1421
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,830
the slide. Uh so
uh one will be to do the same thing for

1422
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
uh one will be to do the same thing for
 

1423
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,990
uh one will be to do the same thing for
a code. So we'll have homework

1424
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,000
a code. So we'll have homework
 

1425
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,630
a code. So we'll have homework
assignments that involve code. So then

1426
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:16,640
assignments that involve code. So then
 

1427
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,789
assignments that involve code. So then
see using co-pilots, cursor,

1428
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:20,799
see using co-pilots, cursor,
 

1429
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,789
see using co-pilots, cursor,
winds surf any of these different tools

1430
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
winds surf any of these different tools
 

1431
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,389
winds surf any of these different tools
that you have incl or just the straight

1432
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:24,399
that you have incl or just the straight
 

1433
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,110
that you have incl or just the straight
LMS directly and see how do they do on

1434
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
LMS directly and see how do they do on
 

1435
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,110
LMS directly and see how do they do on
that coding problem and interact with

1436
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,120
that coding problem and interact with
 

1437
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,590
that coding problem and interact with
them as well. We expect why do we do

1438
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:31,600
them as well. We expect why do we do
 

1439
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,350
them as well. We expect why do we do
this? We expect students in a course

1440
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,360
this? We expect students in a course
 

1441
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,070
this? We expect students in a course
like this to walk away not just with an

1442
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,080
like this to walk away not just with an
 

1443
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,310
like this to walk away not just with an
understanding of deep learning from a

1444
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,320
understanding of deep learning from a
 

1445
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,789
understanding of deep learning from a
theoretical and a

1446
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:40,799
theoretical and a
 

1447
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,710
theoretical and a
let's say a 2019 level way of engaging

1448
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:44,720
let's say a 2019 level way of engaging
 

1449
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,630
let's say a 2019 level way of engaging
with a computer. but also the modern

1450
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:46,640
with a computer. but also the modern
 

1451
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,549
with a computer. but also the modern
way. So we want you everyone to have at

1452
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:48,559
way. So we want you everyone to have at
 

1453
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,630
way. So we want you everyone to have at
least some practice doing this. Okay.

1454
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,640
least some practice doing this. Okay.
 

1455
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,990
least some practice doing this. Okay.
>> No, it's not worth it. Um

1456
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,000
>> No, it's not worth it. Um
 

1457
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,430
>> No, it's not worth it. Um
>> so this is the uh second thing. Third

1458
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,440
>> so this is the uh second thing. Third
 

1459
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,509
>> so this is the uh second thing. Third
thing is also related to code. It's to

1460
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
thing is also related to code. It's to
 

1461
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,310
thing is also related to code. It's to
the code. So we built these homeworks

1462
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,320
the code. So we built these homeworks
 

1463
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,750
the code. So we built these homeworks
over many semesters and they were built

1464
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
over many semesters and they were built
 

1465
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,590
over many semesters and they were built
trying to get them out the door so they

1466
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:11,600
trying to get them out the door so they
 

1467
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,990
trying to get them out the door so they
can teach the right thing for students.

1468
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,000
can teach the right thing for students.
 

1469
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,909
can teach the right thing for students.
They're not the best written code.

1470
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:15,919
They're not the best written code.
 

1471
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,590
They're not the best written code.
They're not actually code that we would

1472
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:17,600
They're not actually code that we would
 

1473
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,070
They're not actually code that we would
be proud to have as our demonstrations

1474
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,080
be proud to have as our demonstrations
 

1475
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,470
be proud to have as our demonstrations
of code. Another thing you can do as a

1476
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
of code. Another thing you can do as a
 

1477
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,710
of code. Another thing you can do as a
special contribution is to consult,

1478
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
special contribution is to consult,
 

1479
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,350
special contribution is to consult,
critique, look at online descriptions of

1480
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
critique, look at online descriptions of
 

1481
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,549
critique, look at online descriptions of
what is good coding style, both Pythonic

1482
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,559
what is good coding style, both Pythonic
 

1483
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,029
what is good coding style, both Pythonic

specifically machine learning oriented
 

1487
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,750
specifically machine learning oriented
and take one of the problems and clean

1488
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:37,760
and take one of the problems and clean
 

1489
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,830
and take one of the problems and clean
it up. Okay? To reflect that style. This

1490
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:41,840
it up. Okay? To reflect that style. This
 

1491
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,149
it up. Okay? To reflect that style. This
is good for you and it's good for

1492
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159
is good for you and it's good for
 

1493
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,269
is good for you and it's good for
everyone else. Okay, these are three

1494
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,279
everyone else. Okay, these are three
 

1495
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,870
everyone else. Okay, these are three
examples of special contributions.

1496
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:48,880
examples of special contributions.
 

1497
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,830
examples of special contributions.
There's one more very important one that

1498
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:51,840
There's one more very important one that
 

1499
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,310
There's one more very important one that
I cannot explain to you in a way that

1500
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:54,320
I cannot explain to you in a way that
 

1501
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,470
I cannot explain to you in a way that
you will understand yet. However, it has

1502
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
you will understand yet. However, it has
 

1503
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,230
you will understand yet. However, it has
to do with the following. The field is

1504
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,240
to do with the following. The field is
 

1505
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,630
to do with the following. The field is
moving and keeps moving. Some of the

1506
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:00,640
moving and keeps moving. Some of the
 

1507
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,710
moving and keeps moving. Some of the
homework was built, oh my goodness, as

1508
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:02,720
homework was built, oh my goodness, as
 

1509
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,350
homework was built, oh my goodness, as
far back as 2022.

1510
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,360
far back as 2022.
 

1511
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,310
far back as 2022.
And uh so

1512
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
And uh so
 

1513
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,549
And uh so
there have been advances.

1514
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:10,559
there have been advances.
 

1515
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,549
there have been advances.
We do not have the staff bandwidth to

1516
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:12,559
We do not have the staff bandwidth to
 

1517
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,310
We do not have the staff bandwidth to
actually take all of the problems and

1518
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,320
actually take all of the problems and
 

1519
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,070
actually take all of the problems and
make them aligned to our current best

1520
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
make them aligned to our current best
 

1521
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,909
make them aligned to our current best
understanding. There will be another

1522
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:17,919
understanding. There will be another
 

1523
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,230
understanding. There will be another
option a view for you to do that to add

1524
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,240
option a view for you to do that to add
 

1525
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,549
option a view for you to do that to add
parts to problems that reflect things

1526
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:22,559
parts to problems that reflect things
 

1527
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,310
parts to problems that reflect things
we're going to teach you that were not

1528
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
we're going to teach you that were not
 

1529
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,230
we're going to teach you that were not
understood in 2022. Okay, as an example,

1530
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,240
understood in 2022. Okay, as an example,
 

1531
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,230
understood in 2022. Okay, as an example,
we expect everyone to do this uh because

1532
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,240
we expect everyone to do this uh because
 

1533
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,669
we expect everyone to do this uh because
this is how you will really learn and

1534
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:33,679
this is how you will really learn and
 

1535
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,310
this is how you will really learn and
master the material and you'll help

1536
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,320
master the material and you'll help
 

1537
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,149
master the material and you'll help
everyone else as well. Okay, so

1538
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:40,159
everyone else as well. Okay, so
 

1539
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,190
everyone else as well. Okay, so
I will pause here now for questions

1540
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
I will pause here now for questions
 

1541
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,269
I will pause here now for questions
because we're going to then switch into

1542
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
because we're going to then switch into
 

1543
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,789
because we're going to then switch into
talking about deep learning. We talked

1544
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
talking about deep learning. We talked
 

1545
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,870
talking about deep learning. We talked
about a bunch of administrative stuff.

1546
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:48,880
about a bunch of administrative stuff.
 

1547
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,470
about a bunch of administrative stuff.
Remember the short version is go to the

1548
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:50,480
Remember the short version is go to the
 

1549
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,950
Remember the short version is go to the
website, read, go to Ed and find out.

1550
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:52,960
website, read, go to Ed and find out.
 

1551
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,110
website, read, go to Ed and find out.
But anyone have any questions? This is

1552
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,120
But anyone have any questions? This is
 

1553
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,029
But anyone have any questions? This is
the time we can take uh these kind of

1554
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:57,039
the time we can take uh these kind of
 

1555
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,549
the time we can take uh these kind of
any questions right now.

1556
00:33:58,549 --> 00:33:58,559
any questions right now.
 

1557
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,269
any questions right now.
>> Yes.

We'll cap that one. But you you don't

1582
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:23,119
We'll cap that one. But you you don't
 

1583
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,470
We'll cap that one. But you you don't
have to do all of them. We encourage

have to do all of them. We encourage

1589

That's why it's four categories and four

1590
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:29,839
That's why it's four categories and four
 

1591
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,270
That's why it's four categories and four
things so you can try them. But if you

1592
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,280
things so you can try them. But if you
 

1593
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,550

really like doing one kind of thing,

1594
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:32,560
really like doing one kind of thing,
 

1595
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,829
really like doing one kind of thing,
we're not going to make it super strict.

1596
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:33,839
we're not going to make it super strict.
 

1597
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,990
we're not going to make it super strict.
We'll we'll write up guidelines. I mean,

1598
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,000
We'll we'll write up guidelines. I mean,
 

1599
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,790
We'll we'll write up guidelines. I mean,
the objective is of this is not and

1600
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:38,800
the objective is of this is not and
 

1601
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,430
the objective is of this is not and
dying. It's to try and make the

1602
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:41,440
dying. It's to try and make the
 

1603
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,430
dying. It's to try and make the
incentives for you to do work aligned

1604
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:43,440
incentives for you to do work aligned
 

1605
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,510
incentives for you to do work aligned
with the incentives for your learning.

1606
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
with the incentives for your learning.
 

1607
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,470
with the incentives for your learning.
Right? So that's really So why do we say

1608
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:48,480
Right? So that's really So why do we say
 

1609
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,430
Right? So that's really So why do we say
that detail reports are only allowed

1610
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,440
that detail reports are only allowed
 

1611
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,790
that detail reports are only allowed
once? Because let's admit it's easier to

1612
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:54,800
once? Because let's admit it's easier to
 

1613
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,069
once? Because let's admit it's easier to
copy paste a problem into Gemini and see

1614
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
copy paste a problem into Gemini and see
 

1615
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,430
copy paste a problem into Gemini and see
what it turns out. And yes, there's some

1616
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,440
what it turns out. And yes, there's some
 

1617
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,430
what it turns out. And yes, there's some
value for your learning, but writing

1618
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
value for your learning, but writing
 

1619
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,349
value for your learning, but writing
code has a different value for your

1620
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:05,359
code has a different value for your
 

1621
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,990
code has a different value for your
learning. And so if you diversify the

1622
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,000
learning. And so if you diversify the
 

1623
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,310
learning. And so if you diversify the
things you do, you will learn more.

1624
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
things you do, you will learn more.
 

1625
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,510
things you do, you will learn more.
That's basically where this is coming

That's basically where this is coming

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:07,829

>> So

1720
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:07,839
>> So
 

1721
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:08,230
>> So
>> yes.

1722
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,240
>> yes.
 

1723
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:18,950
>> yes.
>> Yeah.

1724
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:18,960

 

1725
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,829

>> No, the point

1726
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:21,839
>> No, the point
 

1727
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,470
>> No, the point
That's the whole point. So we are doing

1728
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:24,480
That's the whole point. So we are doing
 

1729
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,470
That's the whole point. So we are doing
our very best to read papers that have

1730
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,480
our very best to read papers that have
 

1731
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,630
our very best to read papers that have
been published in the last

1732
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:30,640
been published in the last
 

1733
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,670
been published in the last
>> month and

1734
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:33,680
>> month and
 

1735
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,109
>> month and
get the material updated. Of course

1736
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:35,119
get the material updated. Of course
 

1737
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,030
get the material updated. Of course
there going to be some material that is

1738
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,040
there going to be some material that is
 

1739
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,069
there going to be some material that is
canonical historical material like the

1740
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:40,079
canonical historical material like the
 

1741
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,109
canonical historical material like the
definition of a is still the same 2022

1742
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:43,119
definition of a is still the same 2022
 

1743
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,630
definition of a is still the same 2022
and 2025 right SVD even more fundamental

1744
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:48,640
and 2025 right SVD even more fundamental
 

1745
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,790
and 2025 right SVD even more fundamental
also is required we won't be teaching it

1746
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
also is required we won't be teaching it
 

1747
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,510
also is required we won't be teaching it
but so there's stuff that's fundamental

1748
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:53,520
but so there's stuff that's fundamental
 

1749
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,030
but so there's stuff that's fundamental
and that's going to be the same but

1750
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,040
and that's going to be the same but
 

1751
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,829
and that's going to be the same but
there's stuff that's new and what we're

1752
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:57,839
there's stuff that's new and what we're
 

1753
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,910
there's stuff that's new and what we're
trying to do is you know trying to

1754
00:37:59,910 --> 00:37:59,920
trying to do is you know trying to
 

1755
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,990
trying to do is you know trying to
digest this material that's not even in

1756
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,000
digest this material that's not even in
 

1757
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,430
digest this material that's not even in
the textbooks yet and present it to

1758
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:05,440
the textbooks yet and present it to
 

1759
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,109
the textbooks yet and present it to
So for example right um just some some

1760
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:09,119
So for example right um just some some
 

1761
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,950
So for example right um just some some
of the things that make us tip into this

1762
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:10,960
of the things that make us tip into this
 

1763
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,349
of the things that make us tip into this
vast literature that make us tip what is

1764
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:13,359
vast literature that make us tip what is
 

1765
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,950
vast literature that make us tip what is
relevant to teach you is a kind of sense

1766
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:14,960
relevant to teach you is a kind of sense
 

1767
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,950
relevant to teach you is a kind of sense
of stability like is this understanding

1768
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:16,960
of stability like is this understanding
 

1769
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,870
of stability like is this understanding
that's actually having impact and so

1770
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:18,880
that's actually having impact and so
 

1771
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,589
that's actually having impact and so
recently um the release of the of

1772
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:21,599
recently um the release of the of
 

1773
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,069
recently um the release of the of
certain Chinese open source models right

1774
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:24,079
certain Chinese open source models right
 

1775
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,990
certain Chinese open source models right
uh I think Kim too

1776
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
uh I think Kim too
 

1777
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,950
uh I think Kim too
>> right in particular made it very clear

1778
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:28,960
>> right in particular made it very clear
 

1779
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,190
>> right in particular made it very clear
that there were things as well as llama

1780
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,200
that there were things as well as llama
 

1781
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,710
that there were things as well as llama
for that made it very clear that things

1782
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
for that made it very clear that things
 

1783
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,710
for that made it very clear that things
that we were kind maybe sitting back on

1784
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:34,720
that we were kind maybe sitting back on
 

1785
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,390
that we were kind maybe sitting back on
that is this really something that

1786
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:36,400
that is this really something that
 

1787
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,109
that is this really something that
everyone needs to know or you know is it

1788
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,119
everyone needs to know or you know is it
 

1789
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,190
everyone needs to know or you know is it
still you know too far on the frontier

1790
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,200
still you know too far on the frontier
 

1791
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,710
still you know too far on the frontier
do you guys need to know it okay so that

1792
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:44,720
do you guys need to know it okay so that
 

1793
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,870
do you guys need to know it okay so that
kind of stuff is being is going to be

1794
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:46,880
kind of stuff is being is going to be
 

1795
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,710
kind of stuff is being is going to be
worked into the class so the material in

1796
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
worked into the class so the material in
 

1797
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,349
worked into the class so the material in
the class is different you um the

1798
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:51,359
the class is different you um the
 

1799
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,109
the class is different you um the
material

1800
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:53,119
material
 

1801
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,230
material
the LLMs without reading papers cannot

1802
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,240
the LLMs without reading papers cannot
 

1803
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,069
the LLMs without reading papers cannot
do well in everything in this class

1804
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:58,079
do well in everything in this class
 

1805
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,510
do well in everything in this class
because there'll be information beyond

1806
00:38:59,510 --> 00:38:59,520
because there'll be information beyond
 

1807
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,150
because there'll be information beyond
their training cutoff date okay So yeah,

1808
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,160
their training cutoff date okay So yeah,
 

1809
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,430
their training cutoff date okay So yeah,
the material in the class will keep

1810
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:05,440
the material in the class will keep
 

1811
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,510
the material in the class will keep
evolving and changing. Just to give you

1812
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,520
evolving and changing. Just to give you
 

1813
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,829
evolving and changing. Just to give you
a sense of this, when I first taught the

1814
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:09,839
a sense of this, when I first taught the
 

1815
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,470
a sense of this, when I first taught the
class in fall 2022,

1816
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:12,480
class in fall 2022,
 

1817
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,349
class in fall 2022,
um just before the beginning of the

1818
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:15,359
um just before the beginning of the
 

1819
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,390
um just before the beginning of the
class, stable diffusion had come out.

1820
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:18,400
class, stable diffusion had come out.
 

1821
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,310
class, stable diffusion had come out.
Just before

1822
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:20,320
Just before
 

1823
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,710
Just before
by the end of the class, there was the

1824
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:22,720
by the end of the class, there was the
 

1825
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,270
by the end of the class, there was the
release of chat GPT. During the majority

1826
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,280
release of chat GPT. During the majority
 

1827
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,950
release of chat GPT. During the majority
of the class, chat GPT did not exist.

1828
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:28,960
of the class, chat GPT did not exist.
 

1829
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,950
of the class, chat GPT did not exist.
Okay. And like this there have been

1830
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:30,960
Okay. And like this there have been
 

1831
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,630
Okay. And like this there have been
advances sort of in the different terms

1832
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:32,640
advances sort of in the different terms
 

1833
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,030
advances sort of in the different terms
and we try to you know kind of make

1834
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,040
and we try to you know kind of make
 

1835
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,430
and we try to you know kind of make
adjustments as we can to make sure you

1836
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,440
adjustments as we can to make sure you
 

1837
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,069
adjustments as we can to make sure you
are uh at the right place. Not just our

1838
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:42,079
are uh at the right place. Not just our
 

1839
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,550
are uh at the right place. Not just our
goal isn't just that you understand what

1840
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:44,560
goal isn't just that you understand what
 

1841
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,790
goal isn't just that you understand what
is understood now but that you are in

1842
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:46,800
is understood now but that you are in
 

1843
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,390
is understood now but that you are in
the right position to be able to

1844
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,400
the right position to be able to
 

1845
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,390
the right position to be able to
understand the new stuff that will come

1846
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:50,400
understand the new stuff that will come
 

1847
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,630
understand the new stuff that will come
out later this year, next year, the year

1848
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:54,640
out later this year, next year, the year

will not put outlines up there. You're

1876
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:27,839
will not put outlines up there. You're
 

1877
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,109
will not put outlines up there. You're
just going to submit there. Think of it

1878
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:29,119
just going to submit there. Think of it
 

1879
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,589
just going to submit there. Think of it
as a place to place a file. That's what

1880
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:31,599
as a place to place a file. That's what
 

1881
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,950
as a place to place a file. That's what
we're going to do. We don't have time to

1882
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:32,960
we're going to do. We don't have time to
 

1883
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,990
we're going to do. We don't have time to
build outlines. Okay? The homework is on

1884
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,000
build outlines. Okay? The homework is on
 

1885
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,990
build outlines. Okay? The homework is on
the website. So, if you go to x22.org,

1886
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,000
the website. So, if you go to x22.org,
 

1887
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,430
the website. So, if you go to x22.org,
you can click and there'll be homework

1888
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:41,440
you can click and there'll be homework
 

1889
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,150
you can click and there'll be homework
zero. You can see it. Okay? Don't

1890
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,160
zero. You can see it. Okay? Don't
 

1891
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,990
zero. You can see it. Okay? Don't
recommend doing it now, but you will

1892
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,000
recommend doing it now, but you will
 

1893
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,390
recommend doing it now, but you will
have to go through and do it by we have

1894
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,400
have to go through and do it by we have
 

1895
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,630
have to go through and do it by we have
an extended time period, not one week.

1896
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:50,640
an extended time period, not one week.
 

1897
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,870
an extended time period, not one week.
We have until Friday of next week for

1898
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:52,880
We have until Friday of next week for
 

1899
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,630
We have until Friday of next week for
you to do it.

1900
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:54,640
you to do it.
 

1901
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,589
you to do it.
>> Yeah.

1902
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:55,599
>> Yeah.
 

1903
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,030
>> Yeah.
I have a last question. So for the final

1904
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,040
I have a last question. So for the final
 

1905
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,150
I have a last question. So for the final
for the final project like when

1906
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,160
for the final project like when
 

1907
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,069
for the final project like when
we

1908
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
we
 

1909
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,589
we
think about our ideas for

1910
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:05,599
think about our ideas for
 

1911
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,390
think about our ideas for
>> so the final project will be due at the

1912
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:08,400
>> so the final project will be due at the
 

1913
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,109
>> so the final project will be due at the
end of the semester and we will expect

1914
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:11,119
end of the semester and we will expect
 

1915
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,030
end of the semester and we will expect
that you will need to use a bunch of the

1916
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,040
that you will need to use a bunch of the
 

1917
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,349
that you will need to use a bunch of the
techniques that you are learning in the

1918
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
techniques that you are learning in the
 

1919
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,829
techniques that you are learning in the
class to do the project. So we're not in

1920
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:17,839
class to do the project. So we're not in
 

1921
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,109
class to do the project. So we're not in
a position to announce the final

1922
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:19,119
a position to announce the final
 

1923
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,270
a position to announce the final
projects yet because you don't have the

1924
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,280
projects yet because you don't have the
 

1925
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,550
projects yet because you don't have the
material to even you know be able to

1926
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:24,560
material to even you know be able to
 

1927
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,990
material to even you know be able to
conceptualize what it is. So we're

1928
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,000
conceptualize what it is. So we're
 

1929
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,589
conceptualize what it is. So we're
expecting to release the final project

1930
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:27,599
expecting to release the final project
 

1931
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,550
expecting to release the final project
somewhere around mid semester mid to

1932
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,560
somewhere around mid semester mid to
 

1933
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,950
somewhere around mid semester mid to
late semester and then you will have the

1934
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:32,960
late semester and then you will have the
 

1935
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,630
late semester and then you will have the
second half of the semester roughly to

1936
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:34,640
second half of the semester roughly to
 

1937
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,829
second half of the semester roughly to
work on them.

1938
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:35,839
work on them.
 

1939
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,670
work on them.
>> Yeah, we'll have lots of detailed sub

1940
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:37,680
>> Yeah, we'll have lots of detailed sub
 

1941
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,190
>> Yeah, we'll have lots of detailed sub
deadlines and so on but right now it

1942
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,200
deadlines and so on but right now it
 

1943
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,950

would just be gobbledygook.

way way way way better than it was in

2032
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:39,440
way way way way better than it was in
 

2033
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,829
way way way way better than it was in
2015 in the sense that a one-year-old is

2034
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:43,839
2015 in the sense that a one-year-old is
 

2035
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,910
2015 in the sense that a one-year-old is
way o more capable than a newborn. Okay?

2036
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:47,920
way o more capable than a newborn. Okay?
 

2037
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,109
way o more capable than a newborn. Okay?
But we are still babies

2038
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:51,119
But we are still babies
 

2039
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,150
But we are still babies
overall as a species in terms of

2040
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,160
overall as a species in terms of
 

2041
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,710
overall as a species in terms of
actually understanding this material. So

2042
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
actually understanding this material. So
 

2043
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,230
actually understanding this material. So
um this is what we expect your

2044
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:02,240
um this is what we expect your
 

2045
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,230
um this is what we expect your
experience and our experience many times

2046
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:04,240
experience and our experience many times
 

2047
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:36,400
experience and our experience many times
to be like in the class.

2048
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:36,410

[Music]
That's a feeling you'll be familiar

2052
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:39,359
That's a feeling you'll be familiar
 

2053
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,910
That's a feeling you'll be familiar
with.

2054
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
with.
 

2055
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,510
with.
Bye-bye, book. Bye-bye.

2056
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520

 

2057
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,150

Bye-bye.

2058
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:54,160

 

2059
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,230

Okay. So,

2060
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:58,240

 

2061
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,230

we'll do our best to teach you what's

2062
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:00,240
we'll do our best to teach you what's
 

2063
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,510
we'll do our best to teach you what's
going on, but the there's lots of times

2064
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:03,520
going on, but the there's lots of times
 

2065
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,470
going on, but the there's lots of times
where you will experience a lot of

2066
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:06,480
where you will experience a lot of
 

2067
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,069
where you will experience a lot of
internal feeling of uh I'm not sure I'm

2068
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:10,079
internal feeling of uh I'm not sure I'm
 

2069
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,950
internal feeling of uh I'm not sure I'm
comfortable with what's happening here

2070
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:12,960
comfortable with what's happening here
 

2071
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,670
comfortable with what's happening here
in terms of understanding because you'll

2072
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:15,680
in terms of understanding because you'll
 

2073
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,829
in terms of understanding because you'll
be there's a style in which you have

2074
00:45:17,829 --> 00:45:17,839
be there's a style in which you have
 

2075
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,150
be there's a style in which you have
learned u your foundations, your

2076
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,160
learned u your foundations, your
 

2077
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,829
learned u your foundations, your
mathematics, your probability, your um

2078
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:23,839
mathematics, your probability, your um
 

2079
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,349
mathematics, your probability, your um
principles of how we think about

2080
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:25,359
principles of how we think about
 

2081
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,750
principles of how we think about
algorithms and code and linear algebra

2082
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:27,760
algorithms and code and linear algebra
 

2083
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,030
algorithms and code and linear algebra
and optimization and physics which is

2084
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:31,040
and optimization and physics which is
 

2085
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,109
and optimization and physics which is
very very stable and well understood and

2086
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:35,119
very very stable and well understood and
 

2087
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,150
very very stable and well understood and
systematic. There is a rigor um and a

2088
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
systematic. There is a rigor um and a
 

2089
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,710
systematic. There is a rigor um and a
connection between the rigorous

2090
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:40,720
connection between the rigorous
 

2091
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,230
connection between the rigorous
understanding and experiments and the

2092
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:44,240
understanding and experiments and the
 

2093
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,069
understanding and experiments and the
gaps between what people understand and

2094
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:48,079
gaps between what people understand and
 

2095
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:52,150
gaps between what people understand and
what you are taught. I mean they are

2096
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:52,160
what you are taught. I mean they are
 

2097
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,950
what you are taught. I mean they are
some of them are being masked. Um but

2098
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:54,960
some of them are being masked. Um but
 

2099
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,990
some of them are being masked. Um but
some there some of them are more subtle.

2100
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,000
some there some of them are more subtle.
 

2101
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,750
some there some of them are more subtle.
In deep learning it's much more in your

2102
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:01,760
In deep learning it's much more in your
 

2103
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,910
In deep learning it's much more in your
face that we don't understand things. So

2104
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:05,920
face that we don't understand things. So
 

2105
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,309
face that we don't understand things. So
we will keep pointing this out um as we

2106
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:08,319
we will keep pointing this out um as we
 

2107
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,630
we will keep pointing this out um as we
as we go uh in the class for at

2108
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:10,640
as we go uh in the class for at
 

2109
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,390
as we go uh in the class for at
different places but you just have to

2110
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
different places but you just have to
 

2111
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,390
different places but you just have to
I have to we have to acknowledge it. So

2112
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
I have to we have to acknowledge it. So
 

2113
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,309
I have to we have to acknowledge it. So
let me see what I Okay. So we talk about

2114
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:20,319
let me see what I Okay. So we talk about
 

2115
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,910
let me see what I Okay. So we talk about
deep learning like what are we actually

2116
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:21,920
deep learning like what are we actually
 

2117
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,190
deep learning like what are we actually
talking about here? What is this class

2118
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:23,200
talking about here? What is this class
 

2119
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,750
talking about here? What is this class
about? So

2120
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:25,760
about? So
 

2121
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,150
about? So
fundamentally deep learning involves is

2122
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:28,160
fundamentally deep learning involves is
 

2123
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,670
fundamentally deep learning involves is
a class a class about neural net. So

2124
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:29,680
a class a class about neural net. So
 

2125
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,150
a class a class about neural net. So
what is a neural net? A neural net is

2126
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,160
what is a neural net? A neural net is
 

2127
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,790
what is a neural net? A neural net is
fundamentally a simulated typically

2128
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:34,800
fundamentally a simulated typically
 

2129
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,750
fundamentally a simulated typically
analog circuit. So first thing is this

2130
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:37,760
analog circuit. So first thing is this
 

2131
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,950
analog circuit. So first thing is this
is not a very

2132
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:40,960
is not a very
 

2133
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,309
is not a very
the values we're interested in are

2134
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:42,319
the values we're interested in are
 

2135
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,910
the values we're interested in are
continuous values that we're working

2136
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:43,920
continuous values that we're working
 

2137
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,670
continuous values that we're working
with. We'll represent them with floating

2138
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:45,680
with. We'll represent them with floating
 

2139
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,910
with. We'll represent them with floating
point, but they're continuous values.

2140
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:47,920
point, but they're continuous values.
 

2141
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,829
point, but they're continuous values.
And these circuits are largely parallel

2142
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:51,839
And these circuits are largely parallel
 

2143
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,750
And these circuits are largely parallel
in what they do and they're doing

2144
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,760
in what they do and they're doing
 

2145
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,990
in what they do and they're doing
information processing.

2146
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,000
information processing.
 

2147
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,470
information processing.
But to set the very very very many

2148
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:58,480
But to set the very very very many
 

2149
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,069
But to set the very very very many
parameters associated with this circuit,

2150
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:02,079
parameters associated with this circuit,
 

2151
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,950
parameters associated with this circuit,
we have to use an optimization algorithm

2152
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
we have to use an optimization algorithm
 

2153
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,550
we have to use an optimization algorithm
to set these parameters. We don't

2154
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:06,560
to set these parameters. We don't
 

2155
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,470
to set these parameters. We don't
handcraft them. At times in the

2156
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:08,480
handcraft them. At times in the
 

2157
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,309
handcraft them. At times in the
homework, we will ask you to handcraft

2158
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:10,319
homework, we will ask you to handcraft
 

2159
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,470
homework, we will ask you to handcraft
parameters to help you understand the

2160
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:12,480
parameters to help you understand the
 

2161
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,069
parameters to help you understand the
relationship between the parameters and

2162
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:14,079
relationship between the parameters and
 

2163
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,670
relationship between the parameters and
trying to achieve a certain objective.

2164
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:15,680
trying to achieve a certain objective.
 

2165
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,270
trying to achieve a certain objective.
But in practice, we're using an

2166
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:17,280
But in practice, we're using an
 

2167
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,109
But in practice, we're using an
optimization algorithm driven by data.

2168
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:19,119
optimization algorithm driven by data.
 

2169
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,109
optimization algorithm driven by data.
And so that's what this class is about.

2170
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:21,119
And so that's what this class is about.
 

2171
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,190
And so that's what this class is about.
What makes it deep learning, why we call

2172
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:23,200
What makes it deep learning, why we call
 

2173
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,910
What makes it deep learning, why we call
it deep learning is that the circuits

2174
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:25,920
it deep learning is that the circuits
 

2175
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,630
it deep learning is that the circuits
that we're talking about in practice are

2176
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
that we're talking about in practice are
 

2177
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,109
that we're talking about in practice are
deep and they have many many layers uh

2178
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:31,119
deep and they have many many layers uh
 

2179
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,630
deep and they have many many layers uh
many many circuit elements have to pass

2180
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:32,640
many many circuit elements have to pass
 

2181
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,470
many many circuit elements have to pass
through before you get to the end. Okay,

2182
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:34,480
through before you get to the end. Okay,
 

2183
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,790
through before you get to the end. Okay,
that's what we mean.

2184
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:36,800
that's what we mean.
 

2185
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,750
that's what we mean.
So we do this with a goal. We would have

2186
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,760
So we do this with a goal. We would have
 

2187
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,430
So we do this with a goal. We would have
like like the learn circuit the result

2188
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:43,440
like like the learn circuit the result
 

2189
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,109
like like the learn circuit the result
of the optimization driven by data to

2190
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:47,119
of the optimization driven by data to
 

2191
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,430
of the optimization driven by data to
appropriately approximately capture

2192
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:49,440
appropriately approximately capture
 

2193
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,990
appropriately approximately capture
relevant patterns underlying the data.

2194
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,000
relevant patterns underlying the data.
 

2195
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,510
relevant patterns underlying the data.
This is what it shares with machine

2196
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,520
This is what it shares with machine
 

2197
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,870
This is what it shares with machine
learning. It's a subcategory of machine

2198
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:54,880
learning. It's a subcategory of machine
 

2199
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,870
learning. It's a subcategory of machine
learning

2200
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:56,880
learning
 

2201
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,550
learning
um where those patterns are present in

2202
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:58,560
um where those patterns are present in
 

2203
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,349
um where those patterns are present in
the data that's used to train it. And we

2204
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:01,359
the data that's used to train it. And we
 

2205
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,589
the data that's used to train it. And we
want to do this so we can use the

2206
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:03,599
want to do this so we can use the
 

2207
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,829
want to do this so we can use the
resulting circuit to solve problems

2208
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:05,839
resulting circuit to solve problems
 

2209
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,069
resulting circuit to solve problems
involving new data.

2210
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:08,079
involving new data.
 

2211
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,230
involving new data.
Okay, what problems? Problems for which

2212
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:10,240
Okay, what problems? Problems for which
 

2213
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,510
Okay, what problems? Problems for which
whatever patterns we've learned are

2214
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:11,520
whatever patterns we've learned are
 

2215
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,069
whatever patterns we've learned are
relevant. Okay, that's that's the kind

2216
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:14,079
relevant. Okay, that's that's the kind
 

2217
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,750
relevant. Okay, that's that's the kind
of connection to regular machine

2218
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:15,760
of connection to regular machine
 

2219
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,510
of connection to regular machine
learning.

2220
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:17,520
learning.
 

2221
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,270
learning.
So

2222
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
So
 

2223
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,790
So
this

2224
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:20,800
this
 

2225
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,710
this
sounds great. Okay, fine. We want to do

2226
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,720
sounds great. Okay, fine. We want to do
 

2227
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,230
sounds great. Okay, fine. We want to do
this.

2228
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:24,240
this.
 

2229
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,710
this.
But the reality of the subject is we

2230
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:28,720
But the reality of the subject is we
 

2231
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,270
But the reality of the subject is we
barely know how to do this.

2232
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:31,280
barely know how to do this.
 

2233
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,990
barely know how to do this.
We build things. We try them out. They

2234
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
We build things. We try them out. They
 

2235
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,790
We build things. We try them out. They
work. We have reason and and intuitions

2236
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:36,800
work. We have reason and and intuitions
 

2237
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,829
work. We have reason and and intuitions
for building it. But these don't often

2238
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:39,839
for building it. But these don't often
 

2239
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,510
for building it. But these don't often
match the level of rigor you might

2240
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:41,520
match the level of rigor you might
 

2241
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,950
match the level of rigor you might
expect. For example, if you were

2242
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:42,960
expect. For example, if you were
 

2243
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,670
expect. For example, if you were
constructing a bridge,

2244
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:45,680
constructing a bridge,
 

2245
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,710
constructing a bridge,
you know, so how to get how to wrap your

2246
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:48,720
you know, so how to get how to wrap your
 

2247
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,030
you know, so how to get how to wrap your
head around it. In this class, we'll

2248
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,040
head around it. In this class, we'll
 

2249
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,270
head around it. In this class, we'll
basically have two approaches. We will

2250
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:53,280
basically have two approaches. We will
 

2251
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,549
basically have two approaches. We will
help you to help you wrap your head

2252
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:54,559
help you to help you wrap your head
 

2253
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,030
help you to help you wrap your head
around it. The first is a joke. Okay?

2254
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:57,040
around it. The first is a joke. Okay?
 

2255
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,549
around it. The first is a joke. Okay?
So, I will tell you this joke. I will

2256
00:48:58,549 --> 00:48:58,559
So, I will tell you this joke. I will
 

2257
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,549
So, I will tell you this joke. I will
this joke will be told over and over

2258
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:00,559
this joke will be told over and over
 

2259
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,109
this joke will be told over and over
again in this class um to help explain

2260
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:03,119
again in this class um to help explain
 

2261
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,430
again in this class um to help explain
why things happen the way they do. The

2262
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,440
why things happen the way they do. The
 

2263
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,470
why things happen the way they do. The
joke goes like this. You might have

2264
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:06,480
joke goes like this. You might have
 

2265
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,910
joke goes like this. You might have
heard this joke. So,

2266
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:09,920
heard this joke. So,
 

2267
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,710
heard this joke. So,
a person is walking and they see it's a

2268
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:12,720
a person is walking and they see it's a
 

2269
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,630
a person is walking and they see it's a
night and they see a drunk man um kind

2270
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:16,640
night and they see a drunk man um kind
 

2271
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,510
night and they see a drunk man um kind
of searching on the ground, you know,

2272
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:19,520
of searching on the ground, you know,
 

2273
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,150
of searching on the ground, you know,
near a street lamp. So, they walk up to

2274
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:22,160
near a street lamp. So, they walk up to
 

2275
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,670
near a street lamp. So, they walk up to
this drunk man and they say, "Hey, what

2276
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
this drunk man and they say, "Hey, what
 

2277
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,910
this drunk man and they say, "Hey, what
are you doing? What's wrong?" Goes,

2278
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:27,920
are you doing? What's wrong?" Goes,
 

2279
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,109
are you doing? What's wrong?" Goes,
"Well, I lost my keys and I'm looking

2280
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:31,119
"Well, I lost my keys and I'm looking
 

2281
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,109
"Well, I lost my keys and I'm looking
for them." And so, the person asks the

2282
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:33,119
for them." And so, the person asks the
 

2283
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,109
for them." And so, the person asks the
follow-up question, "Did you lose your

2284
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:35,119
follow-up question, "Did you lose your
 

2285
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,069
follow-up question, "Did you lose your
keys right here?" And the person says,

2286
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:38,079
keys right here?" And the person says,
 

2287
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,750
keys right here?" And the person says,
"No, I lost my keys over there." And the

2288
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:41,760
"No, I lost my keys over there." And the
 

2289
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,510
"No, I lost my keys over there." And the
person asks, "Why are you looking over

2290
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:43,520
person asks, "Why are you looking over
 

2291
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,510
person asks, "Why are you looking over
here?" He goes, "Because here's where

2292
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:45,520
here?" He goes, "Because here's where
 

2293
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,950
here?" He goes, "Because here's where
the light is."

2294
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:48,960

 

2295
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,390

Okay, so this joke is actually

2296
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,400
Okay, so this joke is actually
 

2297
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,390
Okay, so this joke is actually
the essence of what we do in deep

2298
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:58,400
the essence of what we do in deep
 

2299
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,630
the essence of what we do in deep
learning throughout. Many times you'll

2300
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:00,640
learning throughout. Many times you'll
 

2301
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,870
learning throughout. Many times you'll
have a very natural question which will

2302
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:02,880
have a very natural question which will
 

2303
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,549
have a very natural question which will
be well you said we wanted to do X. Why

2304
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:06,559
be well you said we wanted to do X. Why
 

2305
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,069
be well you said we wanted to do X. Why
are we doing Y? And the answer will be

2306
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:10,079
are we doing Y? And the answer will be
 

2307
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,069
are we doing Y? And the answer will be
because we understand how to think about

2308
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:12,079
because we understand how to think about
 

2309
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,630
because we understand how to think about
Y. We do not understand how to think

2310
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:14,640
Y. We do not understand how to think
 

2311
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,910
Y. We do not understand how to think
about X. So we're going to do Y.

2312
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:19,920

 

2313
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,270

Okay. Now

2314
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280
Okay. Now
 

2315
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,710
Okay. Now
the pragmatic sense of this is actually

2316
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:26,720
the pragmatic sense of this is actually
 

2317
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,710
the pragmatic sense of this is actually
very reflective of what's in engineering

2318
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:28,720
very reflective of what's in engineering
 

2319
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,750
very reflective of what's in engineering
generally which is

2320
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760
generally which is
 

2321
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,109
generally which is
it's better to do something that has

2322
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:35,119
it's better to do something that has
 

2323
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,150
it's better to do something that has
some chance of succeeding

2324
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,160
some chance of succeeding
 

2325
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,549
some chance of succeeding
than to do nothing which has a 100%

2326
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:40,559
than to do nothing which has a 100%
 

2327
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,950
than to do nothing which has a 100%
chance of not of not succeeding.

2328
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:44,960
chance of not of not succeeding.
 

2329
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,670
chance of not of not succeeding.
Okay. Now ordinarily in your classes

2330
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:47,680
Okay. Now ordinarily in your classes
 

2331
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,190
Okay. Now ordinarily in your classes
this is not although it's a very

2332
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:49,200
this is not although it's a very
 

2333
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,430
this is not although it's a very
fundamental principle it's not in the

2334
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:51,440
fundamental principle it's not in the
 

2335
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,750
fundamental principle it's not in the
foreground in this class it will often

2336
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:53,760
foreground in this class it will often
 

2337
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,069
foreground in this class it will often
be at the foreground

2338
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:56,079
be at the foreground
 

2339
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,710
be at the foreground
so

2340
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:58,720
so
 

2341
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,870
so
what are the things that we understand

2342
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:02,880
what are the things that we understand
 

2343
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,030
what are the things that we understand
this XKCD is a very relevant one so take

2344
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
this XKCD is a very relevant one so take
 

2345
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,470
this XKCD is a very relevant one so take
a chance to look at it many of you might

2346
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:08,480
a chance to look at it many of you might
 

2347

um so in case people in the back can't

2350
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:13,200
um so in case people in the back can't
 

2351
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,349
um so in case people in the back can't
read it there's a stick figure person

2352
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:15,359
read it there's a stick figure person
 

2353
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:17,990
read it there's a stick figure person
standing on a big mess having matrices

2354
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:18,000
standing on a big mess having matrices
 

2355
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,790
standing on a big mess having matrices
and lambdas and stuff in it. And the

2356
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:20,800
and lambdas and stuff in it. And the
 

2357
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,790
and lambdas and stuff in it. And the
person there says, "This is your machine

2358
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
person there says, "This is your machine
 

2359
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,549
person there says, "This is your machine
learning system." He goes, "Yep." You

2360
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:24,559
learning system." He goes, "Yep." You
 

2361
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,390
learning system." He goes, "Yep." You
pour the data in this big pile of linear

2362
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:26,400
pour the data in this big pile of linear
 

2363
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,230
pour the data in this big pile of linear
algebra, then collect the answers on the

2364
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,240
algebra, then collect the answers on the
 

2365
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,069
algebra, then collect the answers on the
other side. What if the answers are

2366
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
other side. What if the answers are
 

2367
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,990
other side. What if the answers are
wrong? Just stir the pile until they

2368
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:32,000
wrong? Just stir the pile until they
 

2369
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,710
wrong? Just stir the pile until they
start looking right.

2370
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:34,720
start looking right.
 

2371
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,150
start looking right.
Okay? So,

2372
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:38,160
Okay? So,
 

2373
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,470
Okay? So,
you will find in this class that we will

2374
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:40,480
you will find in this class that we will
 

2375
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,790
you will find in this class that we will
lean often on linear algebra. So it's

2376
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:44,800
lean often on linear algebra. So it's
 

2377
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,390
lean often on linear algebra. So it's
good to acknowledge the many reasons

2378
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:46,400
good to acknowledge the many reasons
 

2379
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,309
good to acknowledge the many reasons
why.

2380
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:48,319
why.
 

2381
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,670
why.
One reason is linear algebra is

2382
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:51,680
One reason is linear algebra is
 

2383
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,150
One reason is linear algebra is
something that we understand

2384
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
something that we understand
 

2385
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,670
something that we understand
and it's something that we have

2386
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:55,680
and it's something that we have
 

2387
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,109
and it's something that we have
intuition about that we can connect to

2388
00:51:57,109 --> 00:51:57,119
intuition about that we can connect to
 

2389
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,710
intuition about that we can connect to
geometry.

2390
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:58,720
geometry.
 

2391
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,030
geometry.
So if you're thinking about something,

2392
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:01,040
So if you're thinking about something,
 

2393
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,390
So if you're thinking about something,
it's easier to think about things in the

2394
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:02,400
it's easier to think about things in the
 

2395
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,910
it's easier to think about things in the
context of something you understand.

2396
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:03,920
context of something you understand.
 

2397
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,390
context of something you understand.
Second, linear algebra is something that

2398
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,400
Second, linear algebra is something that
 

2399
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,549
Second, linear algebra is something that
we have made computers very good at

2400
00:52:08,549 --> 00:52:08,559
we have made computers very good at
 

2401
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,230
we have made computers very good at
doing.

2402
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:10,240
doing.
 

2403
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,349
doing.
they match naturally to parallel

2404
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:13,359
they match naturally to parallel
 

2405
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,230
they match naturally to parallel
processing that happens on uh SIMD

2406
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:16,240
processing that happens on uh SIMD
 

2407
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,230
processing that happens on uh SIMD
processors and other proc GPU like

2408
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:18,240
processors and other proc GPU like
 

2409
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,870
processors and other proc GPU like
machines and so if you want to do

2410
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:20,880
machines and so if you want to do
 

2411
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,190
machines and so if you want to do
something you might as well do it using

2412
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:23,200
something you might as well do it using
 

2413
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,710
something you might as well do it using
something you know how to do fast on a

2414
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:24,720
something you know how to do fast on a
 

2415
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,230
something you know how to do fast on a
computer

2416
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:26,240
computer
 

2417
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,589
computer
so we use this as a building block but

2418
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:29,599
so we use this as a building block but
 

2419
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,349
so we use this as a building block but
don't forget the it's what we understand

2420
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:31,359
don't forget the it's what we understand
 

2421
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,710
don't forget the it's what we understand
so many times we'll be building you

2422
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:32,720
so many times we'll be building you
 

2423
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,589
so many times we'll be building you
intuition using simple linear algebraic

2424
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:35,599
intuition using simple linear algebraic
 

2425
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,230
intuition using simple linear algebraic
formulations and you'll say how do I

2426
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:38,240
formulations and you'll say how do I
 

2427
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,910
formulations and you'll say how do I
know this applies to my deep learning

2428
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:39,920
know this applies to my deep learning
 

2429
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,430
know this applies to my deep learning
And the answer is well we understand it

2430
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:41,440
And the answer is well we understand it
 

2431
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,190
And the answer is well we understand it
here and it seems to have intuitions

2432
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:43,200
here and it seems to have intuitions
 

2433
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,150
here and it seems to have intuitions
that carry over and so we will use it.

2434
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:46,160
that carry over and so we will use it.
 

2435
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,710
that carry over and so we will use it.

that when I started learning deep

2440
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:54,240
that when I started learning deep
 

2441
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,630
that when I started learning deep
learning this was one of the things that

learning this was one of the things that
 

2443
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,190
learning this was one of the things that
made me most uncomfortable about I'm

made me most uncomfortable about I'm
 

2445
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,950
made me most uncomfortable about I'm
used to doing things where I can prove a

used to doing things where I can prove a
 

2447
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,630
used to doing things where I can prove a
theorem and I know for 100% that like I

theorem and I know for 100% that like I
 

2449
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,230
theorem and I know for 100% that like I
have optimized the parameters. I know

00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:06,240
have optimized the parameters. I know
 

2451
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,750
have optimized the parameters. I know
exactly that I'm doing always the

perfectly right thing.
And for someone who is trained to do

2456
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:12,720
And for someone who is trained to do
 

2457

shift. Um, but one that I found is is is

2466
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:29,520
shift. Um, but one that I found is is is
 

2467
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,109
shift. Um, but one that I found is is is
very useful and very mind expanding in

2468
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:33,119
very useful and very mind expanding in
 

2469
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,349
very useful and very mind expanding in
in really nice ways. It's interesting to

2470
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:35,359
in really nice ways. It's interesting to
 

2471
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,750
in really nice ways. It's interesting to
see how your minds have gotten trained

2472
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:37,760
see how your minds have gotten trained
 

2473
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,870
see how your minds have gotten trained
into having a particular way of doing

00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
into having a particular way of doing
 

2475
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,549
into having a particular way of doing
things. Um, and

2476
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:44,559
things. Um, and
 

2477
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,309
things. Um, and
having this new perspective is actually

2478
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:46,319
having this new perspective is actually
 

2479
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,870
having this new perspective is actually
actually really valuable. On the flip

2480
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:48,880
actually really valuable. On the flip
 

2481
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,390
actually really valuable. On the flip
side, um, what I also see often is that

2482
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,400
side, um, what I also see often is that
 

2483
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,430
side, um, what I also see often is that
there's a lot of because kind of no one

There's a lot of what I what people call
or what I call like ML broism

don't really understand what it means

2500
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:13,920
don't really understand what it means
 

2501
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,670
don't really understand what it means
but you hope that the other person also

2502
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:15,680
but you hope that the other person also
 

2503
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,549
but you hope that the other person also
doesn't understand what it means

2504
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:18,559
doesn't understand what it means
 

2505
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,109
doesn't understand what it means
and you know you just talk in these like

2506
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:21,119
and you know you just talk in these like
 

2507
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,230
and you know you just talk in these like
big big big words and that is also not

2508
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:26,240
big big big words and that is also not
 

2509
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,630
big big big words and that is also not
an ideal situation. And that is not

2510
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:28,640
an ideal situation. And that is not
 

2511
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,230
an ideal situation. And that is not
where we want you to be. What we want to

2512
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:32,240
where we want you to be. What we want to
 

2513
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,230
where we want you to be. What we want to
develop is a sense of groundedness in

2514
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:36,240
develop is a sense of groundedness in
 

2515
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,109
develop is a sense of groundedness in
fundamentals that comes from the

2516
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:39,119
fundamentals that comes from the
 

2517
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,190
fundamentals that comes from the
training that you have developed through

2518
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:41,200
training that you have developed through
 

2519
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,109
training that you have developed through
taking hard classes like 126, like 127

2520
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:45,119
taking hard classes like 126, like 127
 

2521
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,589
taking hard classes like 126, like 127
where you've ground out these large

2522
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:47,599
where you've ground out these large
 

2523
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,309
where you've ground out these large
proofs. And so you have that aesthetic

2524
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:50,319
proofs. And so you have that aesthetic
 

2525
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,430
proofs. And so you have that aesthetic
and elegance of mathematical beauty and

2526
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:53,440
and elegance of mathematical beauty and
 

2527
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,630
and elegance of mathematical beauty and
bring that to the linear algebra soup,

2528
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:56,640
bring that to the linear algebra soup,
 

2529
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,030
bring that to the linear algebra soup,
right? So that we can try to see the

2530
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,040
right? So that we can try to see the
 

2531
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,470
right? So that we can try to see the
elegance and the beauty in that soup. So

2532
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:02,480
elegance and the beauty in that soup. So
 

2533
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,750
elegance and the beauty in that soup. So
these are two different ways of

2534
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:03,760
these are two different ways of
 

2535
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,910
these are two different ways of
thinking, but they're both really

2536
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:05,920
thinking, but they're both really
 

2537
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,349
thinking, but they're both really
important. Um is what I wanted to add.

2538
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:09,359
important. Um is what I wanted to add.
 

2539
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:14,069
important. Um is what I wanted to add.
>> Yeah. And uh so uh again uh another

2540
00:55:14,069 --> 00:55:14,079
>> Yeah. And uh so uh again uh another
 

2541
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:19,349
>> Yeah. And uh so uh again uh another
joke. Uh so there's a

2542
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:19,359
joke. Uh so there's a
 

2543
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,390
joke. Uh so there's a
An engineer, a mathematician and a

2544
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:22,400
An engineer, a mathematician and a
 

2545
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,270
An engineer, a mathematician and a
physicist are all drunk and they're have

2546
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:25,280
physicist are all drunk and they're have
 

2547
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,549
physicist are all drunk and they're have
decided that uh all the odd numbers are

2548
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
decided that uh all the odd numbers are
 

2549
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,750
decided that uh all the odd numbers are
prime and so they proceed to talk about

2550
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:31,760
prime and so they proceed to talk about
 

2551
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,910
prime and so they proceed to talk about
it. And the mathematician says, "Well,

2552
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:35,920
it. And the mathematician says, "Well,
 

2553
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,950
it. And the mathematician says, "Well,
three is prime, five is prime, seven is

2554
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:38,960
three is prime, five is prime, seven is
 

2555
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,630
three is prime, five is prime, seven is
prime. It follows by induction. They're

2556
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:40,640
prime. It follows by induction. They're
 

2557
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,630
prime. It follows by induction. They're
all prime."

2558
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:42,640
all prime."
 

2559
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,630
all prime."
And the physicist says, "Three is prime,

2560
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:46,640
And the physicist says, "Three is prime,
 

2561
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,270
And the physicist says, "Three is prime,
five is prime, seven is prime, nine is

2562
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
five is prime, seven is prime, nine is
 

2563
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,309
five is prime, seven is prime, nine is
experimental error, 11 is prime, they're

2564
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,319
experimental error, 11 is prime, they're
 

2565
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,150
experimental error, 11 is prime, they're
all prime."

2566
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:54,160
all prime."
 

2567
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,950
all prime."
And the engineer says, "Three is prime,

2568
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:56,960
And the engineer says, "Three is prime,
 

2569
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,789
And the engineer says, "Three is prime,
five is prime, seven is prime, nine is

2570
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
five is prime, seven is prime, nine is
 

2571
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,549
five is prime, seven is prime, nine is
prime, 11 is prime, 10 is prime.

2572
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:02,559
prime, 11 is prime, 10 is prime.
 

2573
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,270
prime, 11 is prime, 10 is prime.
Okay. So

2574
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:05,280
Okay. So
 

2575
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,309
Okay. So
this joke you will often feel. So what

2576
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:08,319
this joke you will often feel. So what
 

2577
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,510
this joke you will often feel. So what
we're hoping is that you will maintain a

2578
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:11,520
we're hoping is that you will maintain a
 

2579
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,309
we're hoping is that you will maintain a
little bit of your sense of groundedness

2580
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:14,319
little bit of your sense of groundedness
 

2581
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,870
little bit of your sense of groundedness
to know when we are pushing things

2582
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:16,880
to know when we are pushing things
 

2583
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,950
to know when we are pushing things
beyond and to feel a little bit like

2584
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:20,960
beyond and to feel a little bit like
 

2585
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,670
beyond and to feel a little bit like
sometimes the physicist in that joke who

2586
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:23,680
sometimes the physicist in that joke who
 

2587
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,109
sometimes the physicist in that joke who
says okay this isn't quite right right

2588
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:27,119
says okay this isn't quite right right
 

2589
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,309
says okay this isn't quite right right
but okay this isn't quite but at times

2590
00:56:30,309 --> 00:56:30,319
but okay this isn't quite but at times
 

2591
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,230
but okay this isn't quite but at times
for practicing in deep learning you will

2592
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:32,240
for practicing in deep learning you will
 

2593
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,589
for practicing in deep learning you will
have to take that engineer's point of

2594
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:33,599
have to take that engineer's point of
 

2595
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,589
have to take that engineer's point of
view and says yeah I know this is not

2596
00:56:35,589 --> 00:56:35,599
view and says yeah I know this is not
 

2597
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,349
view and says yeah I know this is not
right this doesn't follow the theorem

2598
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:37,359
right this doesn't follow the theorem
 

2599
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,910
right this doesn't follow the theorem
But I'll do it anyway.

2600
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:39,920
But I'll do it anyway.
 

2601
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,990
But I'll do it anyway.
Okay. Um, but again, this is part of the

2602
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:42,000
Okay. Um, but again, this is part of the
 

2603
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,910
Okay. Um, but again, this is part of the
aesthetic. You just have to learn how to

2604
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:43,920
aesthetic. You just have to learn how to
 

2605
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,710
aesthetic. You just have to learn how to
do this. So, now

2606
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:46,720
do this. So, now
 

2607
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,750
do this. So, now
I want to talk about um, you know, what

2608
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:49,760
I want to talk about um, you know, what
 

2609
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,750
I want to talk about um, you know, what
this feels like to maybe ground people a

2610
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:51,760
this feels like to maybe ground people a
 

2611
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,549
this feels like to maybe ground people a
little bit more in

2612
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:54,559
little bit more in
 

2613
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,030
little bit more in
your education has come at a very

2614
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:57,040
your education has come at a very
 

2615
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,510
your education has come at a very
special time for human civilization in

2616
00:56:59,510 --> 00:56:59,520
special time for human civilization in
 

2617
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,190
special time for human civilization in
that we actually understand a lot of

2618
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,200
that we actually understand a lot of
 

2619
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,030
that we actually understand a lot of
stuff. But understand that for a very

2620
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:05,040
stuff. But understand that for a very
 

2621
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,990
stuff. But understand that for a very
very very very long time all of the

2622
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:08,000
very very very long time all of the
 

2623
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,069
very very very long time all of the
sciences grew up as alchemy

2624
00:57:12,069 --> 00:57:12,079
sciences grew up as alchemy
 

2625
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,710
sciences grew up as alchemy
where people were trying to turn

2626
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:14,720
where people were trying to turn
 

2627
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,069
where people were trying to turn
different metals into gold, give develop

2628
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:18,079
different metals into gold, give develop
 

2629
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,549
different metals into gold, give develop
potions of immortality, cure various

2630
00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:20,559
potions of immortality, cure various
 

2631
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,589
potions of immortality, cure various
diseases, forecast when appropriate heir

2632
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:23,599
diseases, forecast when appropriate heir
 

2633
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,710
diseases, forecast when appropriate heir
would be born and so on and do various

2634
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:26,720
would be born and so on and do various
 

2635
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,349
would be born and so on and do various
tasks that would allow them to get money

2636
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:29,359
tasks that would allow them to get money
 

2637
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,270
tasks that would allow them to get money
from people who have lots of money and

2638
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:31,280
from people who have lots of money and
 

2639
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,030
from people who have lots of money and
power. So they could go on and continue

2640
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,040
power. So they could go on and continue
 

2641
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,670
power. So they could go on and continue
to fiddle with various chem chemicals

2642
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:35,680
to fiddle with various chem chemicals
 

2643
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,109
to fiddle with various chem chemicals
and put stuff together. Okay, I mean to

2644
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:39,119
and put stuff together. Okay, I mean to
 

2645
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,710
and put stuff together. Okay, I mean to
an extent if you watch what's happening

2646
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
an extent if you watch what's happening
 

2647
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,630
an extent if you watch what's happening
in the venture world and so on, this has

2648
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:42,640
in the venture world and so on, this has
 

2649
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,390
in the venture world and so on, this has
not changed. Um but the important thing

2650
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:46,400
not changed. Um but the important thing
 

2651
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,670
not changed. Um but the important thing
is all of that progress that happened by

2652
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:49,680
is all of that progress that happened by
 

2653
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,710
is all of that progress that happened by
alchemists gave us modern science and

2654
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:52,720
alchemists gave us modern science and
 

2655
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,549
alchemists gave us modern science and
chemistry. They built the experimental

2656
00:57:54,549 --> 00:57:54,559
chemistry. They built the experimental
 

2657
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,069
chemistry. They built the experimental
equipment. They figured out how to do

2658
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:56,079
equipment. They figured out how to do
 

2659
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,230
equipment. They figured out how to do
all this stuff. And remember, human

2660
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:00,240
all this stuff. And remember, human
 

2661
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,150
all this stuff. And remember, human
beings have had amazing ceramics

2662
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,160
beings have had amazing ceramics
 

2663
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,589
beings have had amazing ceramics
for thousands of years before they

2664
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:07,599
for thousands of years before they
 

2665
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,870
for thousands of years before they
understood even the most basic thing

2666
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:10,880
understood even the most basic thing
 

2667
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,549
understood even the most basic thing
about how ceramics actually work.

2668
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:14,559
about how ceramics actually work.
 

2669
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,030
about how ceramics actually work.
People built cathedrals before they

2670
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:17,040
People built cathedrals before they
 

2671
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,390
People built cathedrals before they
understood F equals MA.

2672
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:20,400
understood F equals MA.
 

2673
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,789
understood F equals MA.
Okay. So

2674
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:22,799
Okay. So
 

2675
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,430
Okay. So
the fact that we don't understand many

2676
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:25,440
the fact that we don't understand many
 

2677
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,470
the fact that we don't understand many
things in deep learning, you can think

2678
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:28,480
things in deep learning, you can think
 

2679
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,710
things in deep learning, you can think
about as a little glimpse that you get

2680
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:30,720
about as a little glimpse that you get
 

2681
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,309
about as a little glimpse that you get
to experience today of connecting to the

2682
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:34,319
to experience today of connecting to the
 

2683
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:38,069
to experience today of connecting to the
worlds that your ancestors lived in

2684
00:58:38,069 --> 00:58:38,079
worlds that your ancestors lived in
 

2685
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:41,270
worlds that your ancestors lived in
forever. They worked hard. They made

2686
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:41,280
forever. They worked hard. They made
 

2687
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,349
forever. They worked hard. They made
progress. They made amazing things

2688
00:58:43,349 --> 00:58:43,359
progress. They made amazing things
 

2689
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:44,950
progress. They made amazing things
despite not understanding them at the

2690
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:44,960
despite not understanding them at the
 

2691
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,109
despite not understanding them at the
time. And then understanding sometimes

2692
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:47,119
time. And then understanding sometimes
 

2693
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,270
time. And then understanding sometimes
came 10 years, a hundred years, a

2694
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:51,280
came 10 years, a hundred years, a
 

2695
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,309
came 10 years, a hundred years, a
thousand years, 10,000 years later. So

2696
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:54,319
thousand years, 10,000 years later. So
 

2697
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,309
thousand years, 10,000 years later. So
we don't know where we are in this

2698
00:58:56,309 --> 00:58:56,319
we don't know where we are in this
 

2699
00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:00,309
we don't know where we are in this
process. So

2700
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:00,319

 

2701
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,390

it's okay.

2702
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:02,400
it's okay.
 

2703
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,670
it's okay.
Okay. Um you'll have to remind yourself

2704
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:05,680
Okay. Um you'll have to remind yourself
 

2705
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:11,750
Okay. Um you'll have to remind yourself
of this. This is this is okay. Um

2706
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:11,760

 

2707
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,750

so now I want to talk a little bit about

2708
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:13,760
so now I want to talk a little bit about
 

2709
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,589
so now I want to talk a little bit about
some of the history. Um we're not going

2710
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:15,599
some of the history. Um we're not going
 

2711
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,430
some of the history. Um we're not going
to be taking a a histo a largely

2712
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:17,440
to be taking a a histo a largely
 

2713
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,789
to be taking a a histo a largely
historical perspective. Occasionally

2714
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:18,799
historical perspective. Occasionally
 

2715
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,990
historical perspective. Occasionally
we'll mention history. Um but neural

2716
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:22,000
we'll mention history. Um but neural
 

2717
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,670
we'll mention history. Um but neural
nets are actually uh something that has

2718
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:25,680
nets are actually uh something that has
 

2719
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,870
nets are actually uh something that has
been around for a while and uh neural

2720
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:28,880
been around for a while and uh neural
 

2721
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,589
been around for a while and uh neural
nets have gone through various phases of

2722
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:31,599
nets have gone through various phases of
 

2723
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:36,230
nets have gone through various phases of
excitement. And so back in you know the

2724
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,240
excitement. And so back in you know the
 

2725
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,390
excitement. And so back in you know the
60s

2726
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:38,400
60s
 

2727
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,549
60s
uh 50s actually you know between the 50s

2728
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:40,559
uh 50s actually you know between the 50s
 

2729
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:41,910
uh 50s actually you know between the 50s
and 60s you had the idea of the

2730
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:41,920
and 60s you had the idea of the
 

2731
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,710
and 60s you had the idea of the
perceptron you had the idea of doing uh

2732
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:46,720
perceptron you had the idea of doing uh
 

2733
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,710
perceptron you had the idea of doing uh
pattern recognition using these things

2734
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:48,720
pattern recognition using these things
 

2735
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,349
pattern recognition using these things
having having datadriven methods of LMS

2736
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:51,359
having having datadriven methods of LMS
 

2737
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:55,190
having having datadriven methods of LMS
which is basically gradient descent. Um

2738
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:55,200
which is basically gradient descent. Um
 

2739
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,990
which is basically gradient descent. Um
then you had in 1969 this uh book which

2740
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,000
then you had in 1969 this uh book which
 

2741
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,390
then you had in 1969 this uh book which
described the fundamental limitations of

2742
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:02,400
described the fundamental limitations of
 

2743
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,789
described the fundamental limitations of
a one layer uh neural net and that

2744
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:06,799
a one layer uh neural net and that
 

2745
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:10,390
a one layer uh neural net and that
resulted in part among other things in a

2746
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:10,400
resulted in part among other things in a
 

2747
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,270
resulted in part among other things in a
crash, right? And so neural nets were

2748
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:13,280
crash, right? And so neural nets were
 

2749
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,990
crash, right? And so neural nets were
like super exciting and hot and then

2750
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:16,000
like super exciting and hot and then
 

2751
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,470
like super exciting and hot and then
went through a period of oh they're

2752
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:18,480
went through a period of oh they're
 

2753
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,710
went through a period of oh they're
totally useless and they can't work.

2754
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:20,720
totally useless and they can't work.
 

2755
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,309
totally useless and they can't work.
Historically, this has also been

2756
01:00:22,309 --> 01:00:22,319
Historically, this has also been
 

2757
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,270
Historically, this has also been
connected to when you outstrip the

2758
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:25,280
connected to when you outstrip the
 

2759
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,069
connected to when you outstrip the
available compute. Okay, the actual

2760
01:00:28,069 --> 01:00:28,079
available compute. Okay, the actual
 

2761
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,670
available compute. Okay, the actual
compute you can do, the things you have

2762
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:29,680
compute you can do, the things you have
 

2763
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,349
compute you can do, the things you have
to work with are no longer capable to go

2764
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:31,359
to work with are no longer capable to go
 

2765
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,109
to work with are no longer capable to go
any further and there's a crash of

2766
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:33,119
any further and there's a crash of
 

2767
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,710
any further and there's a crash of
disappointment. So, it's like a neural

2768
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:34,720
disappointment. So, it's like a neural
 

2769
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,789
disappointment. So, it's like a neural
net winter that happens. So, first

2770
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:36,799
net winter that happens. So, first
 

2771
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,150
net winter that happens. So, first
golden age of neural nets ended. Then in

2772
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:40,160
golden age of neural nets ended. Then in
 

2773
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,789
golden age of neural nets ended. Then in
the 80s, compute got better. Other

2774
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:42,799
the 80s, compute got better. Other
 

2775
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,870
the 80s, compute got better. Other
advances happened, fuzzy logic, other

2776
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:44,880
advances happened, fuzzy logic, other
 

2777
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,150
advances happened, fuzzy logic, other
things were brought up. back propagation

2778
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:48,160
things were brought up. back propagation
 

2779
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,230
things were brought up. back propagation
was moved from control theory where it

2780
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:50,240
was moved from control theory where it
 

2781
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,470
was moved from control theory where it
was developed into uh training neural

2782
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:52,480
was developed into uh training neural
 

2783
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,190
was developed into uh training neural
nets and you had the second uh golden

2784
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:57,200
nets and you had the second uh golden
 

2785
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,430
nets and you had the second uh golden
age of neural nets that basically ended

2786
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:01,440
age of neural nets that basically ended
 

2787
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,309
age of neural nets that basically ended
at the end of the 80s the beginning of

2788
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:04,319
at the end of the 80s the beginning of
 

2789
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,950
at the end of the 80s the beginning of
the 90s. Okay, again a crash from the

2790
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960
the 90s. Okay, again a crash from the
 

2791
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,190
the 90s. Okay, again a crash from the
neural net point of view. Although

2792
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:09,200
neural net point of view. Although
 

2793
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,870
neural net point of view. Although
people kept working, smaller groups of

2794
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:10,880
people kept working, smaller groups of
 

2795
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,829
people kept working, smaller groups of
people kept working in the area and

2796
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:13,839
people kept working in the area and
 

2797
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,349
people kept working in the area and
people realized they could do a lot of

2798
01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:15,359
people realized they could do a lot of
 

2799
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,069
people realized they could do a lot of
this stuff much better using stuff that

2800
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:18,079
this stuff much better using stuff that
 

2801
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:21,270
this stuff much better using stuff that
had math that we understood better.

2802
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:21,280
had math that we understood better.
 

2803
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,750
had math that we understood better.
So you had a second golden age of neural

2804
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:23,760
So you had a second golden age of neural
 

2805
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,750
So you had a second golden age of neural
nets that again went away for some time.

2806
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
nets that again went away for some time.
 

2807
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,309
nets that again went away for some time.
Then you had the 2000s.

2808
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:32,319
Then you had the 2000s.
 

2809
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:35,589
Then you had the 2000s.
What happened next is

2810
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:35,599
What happened next is
 

2811
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,910
What happened next is
parallel developments, right? You had

2812
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:37,920
parallel developments, right? You had
 

2813
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,470
parallel developments, right? You had
computer graphics, you had video games

2814
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:42,480
computer graphics, you had video games
 

2815
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,710
computer graphics, you had video games
which led to GPUs. So GPU's main market

2816
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:46,720
which led to GPUs. So GPU's main market
 

2817
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,109
which led to GPUs. So GPU's main market
was video games. And so lots of people

2818
01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:49,119
was video games. And so lots of people
 

2819
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,190
was video games. And so lots of people
wanted to play video games. So GPUs got

2820
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:51,200
wanted to play video games. So GPUs got
 

2821
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,150
wanted to play video games. So GPUs got
better and better and better. And then

2822
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,160
better and better and better. And then
 

2823
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:59,589
better and better and better. And then
in the 2010 20098 time frame, people

2824
01:01:59,589 --> 01:01:59,599
in the 2010 20098 time frame, people
 

2825
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,710
in the 2010 20098 time frame, people
realized, oh, you can use GPUs to train

2826
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:02,720
realized, oh, you can use GPUs to train
 

2827
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,349
realized, oh, you can use GPUs to train
neural nets and they're faster. You can

2828
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:05,359
neural nets and they're faster. You can
 

2829
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:09,990
neural nets and they're faster. You can
make bigger nets. And then in 2020 2012

2830
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:10,000
make bigger nets. And then in 2020 2012
 

2831
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,190
make bigger nets. And then in 2020 2012
begins the modern current the phase we

2832
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:13,200
begins the modern current the phase we
 

2833
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,349
begins the modern current the phase we
live in today um golden age of neural

2834
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:15,359
live in today um golden age of neural
 

2835
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:19,109
live in today um golden age of neural
nets where suddenly the

2836
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:19,119
nets where suddenly the
 

2837
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:22,950
nets where suddenly the
the paper AlexNet beat all previous

2838
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:22,960
the paper AlexNet beat all previous
 

2839
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,750
the paper AlexNet beat all previous
methods for doing uh image

2840
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:25,760
methods for doing uh image
 

2841
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,270
methods for doing uh image
classification

2842
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,280
classification
 

2843
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,950
classification
and made it that neural nets weren't

2844
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:28,960
and made it that neural nets weren't
 

2845
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,230
and made it that neural nets weren't
neurons before that point were viewed as

2846
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
neurons before that point were viewed as
 

2847
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,109
neurons before that point were viewed as
an interesting niche tool. So they were

2848
01:02:35,109 --> 01:02:35,119
an interesting niche tool. So they were
 

2849
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,470
an interesting niche tool. So they were
really good at doing things like

2850
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:36,480
really good at doing things like
 

2851
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,230
really good at doing things like
handwritten digit recognition, other

2852
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:38,240
handwritten digit recognition, other
 

2853
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,470
handwritten digit recognition, other
little tasks. Um they were bigger in

2854
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:40,480
little tasks. Um they were bigger in
 

2855
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,030
little tasks. Um they were bigger in
Japan where they were used in lot uh

2856
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:43,040
Japan where they were used in lot uh
 

2857
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,710
Japan where they were used in lot uh
consumer uh things as a small thing. But

2858
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:46,720
consumer uh things as a small thing. But
 

2859
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,069
consumer uh things as a small thing. But
at this point they were like wait a

2860
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:48,079
at this point they were like wait a
 

2861
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,470
at this point they were like wait a
minute let's just revisit this. And from

2862
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:50,480
minute let's just revisit this. And from
 

2863
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,549
minute let's just revisit this. And from
there you had the building forward um of

2864
01:02:54,549 --> 01:02:54,559
there you had the building forward um of
 

2865
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,710
there you had the building forward um of
the wave that we live in today, right?

2866
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:56,720
the wave that we live in today, right?
 

2867
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,870
the wave that we live in today, right?
Which is this new golden age uh for

2868
01:02:58,870 --> 01:02:58,880
Which is this new golden age uh for
 

2869
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,950
Which is this new golden age uh for
neural nets. So it's good to acknowledge

2870
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:00,960
neural nets. So it's good to acknowledge
 

2871
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,670
neural nets. So it's good to acknowledge
this um history a little bit.

2872
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,680
this um history a little bit.
 

2873
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,589
this um history a little bit.
Um we could keep going and talk about

2874
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:05,599
Um we could keep going and talk about
 

2875
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,349
Um we could keep going and talk about
the different developments for this in

2876
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
the different developments for this in
 

2877
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,789
the different developments for this in
this age and we will do that uh in the

2878
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:10,799
this age and we will do that uh in the
 

2879
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,309
this age and we will do that uh in the
in the course at different points when

2880
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:12,319
in the course at different points when
 

2881
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,069
in the course at different points when
we introduce certain uh key building

2882
01:03:14,069 --> 01:03:14,079
we introduce certain uh key building
 

2883
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,910
we introduce certain uh key building
blocks but I wanted to give you the kind

2884
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:15,920
blocks but I wanted to give you the kind
 

2885
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,430
blocks but I wanted to give you the kind
of prehistory back. Now our perspective

2886
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:19,440
of prehistory back. Now our perspective
 

2887
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,270
of prehistory back. Now our perspective
that we'll use in this class is all

2888
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:21,280
that we'll use in this class is all
 

2889
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,029
that we'll use in this class is all
going to be post 2012.

2890
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:25,039
going to be post 2012.
 

2891
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,190
going to be post 2012.
Okay, we're not going to talk that much

2892
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:27,200
Okay, we're not going to talk that much
 

2893
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,309
Okay, we're not going to talk that much
about uh details of things that were

2894
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:30,319
about uh details of things that were
 

2895
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:32,950
about uh details of things that were
understood back then. Fortunately,

2896
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:32,960
understood back then. Fortunately,
 

2897
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,870
understood back then. Fortunately,
you've taken a machine learning class,

2898
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:34,880
you've taken a machine learning class,
 

2899
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,950
you've taken a machine learning class,
you've already seen back prop, you know

2900
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:36,960
you've already seen back prop, you know
 

2901
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,390
you've already seen back prop, you know
how it works. We don't have to review

2902
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
how it works. We don't have to review
 

2903
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,309
how it works. We don't have to review
that. So, we'll largely focus stuff on

2904
01:03:40,309 --> 01:03:40,319
that. So, we'll largely focus stuff on
 

2905
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:43,109
that. So, we'll largely focus stuff on
stuff afterwards. Okay. So, any

2906
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119
stuff afterwards. Okay. So, any
 

2907
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,109
stuff afterwards. Okay. So, any
questions on this history? And then I'll

2908
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:45,119
questions on this history? And then I'll
 

2909
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,230
questions on this history? And then I'll
switch to the board and start

2910
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,240
switch to the board and start
 

2911
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,190
switch to the board and start
introducing some material for the you

2912
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:49,200
introducing some material for the you
 

2913
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,630
introducing some material for the you
know for the for the course now. Any

2914
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:52,640
know for the for the course now. Any
 

2915
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,589
know for the for the course now. Any
questions on prehistory or

2916
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:55,599
questions on prehistory or
 

2917
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,270
questions on prehistory or
>> other issues?

2918
01:03:59,270 --> 01:03:59,280

 

2919
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,029

Okay, great. So, let's switch to the

2920
01:04:03,029 --> 01:04:03,039
Okay, great. So, let's switch to the
 

2921
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:38,309
Okay, great. So, let's switch to the
board.

2922
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:38,319

 

2923
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:41,029

So let's just think about uh something

2924
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:41,039
So let's just think about uh something
 

2925
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,750
So let's just think about uh something
now. I expect most people um everyone

2926
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:43,760
now. I expect most people um everyone
 

2927
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,630
now. I expect most people um everyone
has seen a multi-layer perceptron before

2928
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:46,640
has seen a multi-layer perceptron before
 

2929
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,870
has seen a multi-layer perceptron before
in your previous machine learning class.

2930
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:48,880
in your previous machine learning class.
 

2931
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,750
in your previous machine learning class.
What I'm going to try to do here is to

2932
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:51,760
What I'm going to try to do here is to
 

2933
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,430
What I'm going to try to do here is to
approach the question from a different

2934
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:53,440
approach the question from a different
 

2935
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,829
approach the question from a different
point of view to connect uh some ideas.

2936
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:57,839
point of view to connect uh some ideas.
 

2937
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,430
point of view to connect uh some ideas.
So

2938
01:04:59,430 --> 01:04:59,440
So
 

2939
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,990
So
we're going to use a neural net to

2940
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:02,000
we're going to use a neural net to
 

2941
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,230
we're going to use a neural net to
approximate functions. So how do we

2942
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
approximate functions. So how do we
 

2943
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,349
approximate functions. So how do we
think about this? The easiest way to

2944
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:07,359
think about this? The easiest way to
 

2945
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:09,109
think about this? The easiest way to
start thinking about it is to think

2946
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:09,119
start thinking about it is to think
 

2947
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,390
start thinking about it is to think
about approximating a function f that

2948
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:12,400
about approximating a function f that
 

2949
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,950
about approximating a function f that
goes

2950
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:14,960
goes
 

2951
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,990
goes
from the reals to the reals. a

2952
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:18,000
from the reals to the reals. a
 

2953
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,309
from the reals to the reals. a
univariate function. Okay, so the input

2954
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:24,319

 

2955
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,710

is x

2956
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:26,720
is x
 

2957
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,510
is x
which is a scalar

2958
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:29,520
which is a scalar
 

2959
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,789
which is a scalar
and the output

2960
01:05:32,789 --> 01:05:32,799
and the output
 

2961
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:37,510
and the output
is y which is also a scaler.

2962
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:37,520

 

2963
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,190

And so in discussion next week we'll

2964
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:39,200
And so in discussion next week we'll
 

2965
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,630
And so in discussion next week we'll
also engage with what I'm talking about

2966
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:40,640
also engage with what I'm talking about
 

2967
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,589
also engage with what I'm talking about
right now. Um

2968
01:05:43,589 --> 01:05:43,599
right now. Um
 

2969
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,230
right now. Um
so how do we think about functions from

2970
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:46,240
so how do we think about functions from
 

2971
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,589
so how do we think about functions from
scalers to scalers? You've been doing

2972
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:47,599
scalers to scalers? You've been doing
 

2973
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,670
scalers to scalers? You've been doing
this for a long time, right? You can

2974
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:49,680
this for a long time, right? You can
 

2975
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:55,190
this for a long time, right? You can
just plot them

2976
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:55,200

 

2977
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,710

XY. And so when we talk about function

2978
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:58,720
XY. And so when we talk about function
 

2979
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,789
XY. And so when we talk about function
approximation, we would like to think

2980
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:00,799
approximation, we would like to think
 

2981
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:03,029
approximation, we would like to think
about approximating an actual underlying

2982
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:03,039
about approximating an actual underlying
 

2983
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:04,789
about approximating an actual underlying
function. And now in the context of

2984
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:04,799
function. And now in the context of
 

2985
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,630
function. And now in the context of
machine learning and neural nets, we

2986
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:06,640
machine learning and neural nets, we
 

2987
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,870
machine learning and neural nets, we
want to approximate a function and we

2988
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:08,880
want to approximate a function and we
 

2989
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,470
want to approximate a function and we
want to approximate learn that

2990
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:10,480
want to approximate learn that
 

2991
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,910
want to approximate learn that
approximation using data samples. So we

2992
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:13,920
approximation using data samples. So we
 

2993
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,670
approximation using data samples. So we
can visualize all that. So we have some

2994
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:15,680
can visualize all that. So we have some
 

2995
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:21,349
can visualize all that. So we have some
function

2996
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:21,359

 

2997
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:22,870

So here's the function our desired

2998
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:22,880
So here's the function our desired
 

2999
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:32,950
So here's the function our desired
function

3000
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,960

 

3001
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,470

and we would like to have a neural net.

3002
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:34,480
and we would like to have a neural net.
 

3003
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:42,470
and we would like to have a neural net.
So we have a neural net

3004
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,480

 

3005
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,349

n and n is going to be defined by some

3006
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:45,359
n and n is going to be defined by some
 

3007
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:47,990
n and n is going to be defined by some
parameters

3008
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,000
parameters
 

3009
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,829
parameters
theta. These are parameters

3010
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:53,839

 

3011
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:56,710

and the neural net matches input output

3012
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:56,720
and the neural net matches input output
 

3013
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,390
and the neural net matches input output
what you want. So n is going to take

3014
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:00,400
what you want. So n is going to take
 

3015
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,549
what you want. So n is going to take
a single scalar input and will output a

3016
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:02,559
a single scalar input and will output a
 

3017
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,309
a single scalar input and will output a
real. Okay. Okay, so we got a neural net

3018
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:04,319
real. Okay. Okay, so we got a neural net
 

3019
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,069
real. Okay. Okay, so we got a neural net
that takes a scalar input, outputs are

3020
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
that takes a scalar input, outputs are
 

3021
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,549
that takes a scalar input, outputs are
real, defined by some parameters such

3022
01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:08,559
real, defined by some parameters such
 

3023
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,789
real, defined by some parameters such
that we can approximate functions.

3024
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
that we can approximate functions.
 

3025
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:13,589
that we can approximate functions.
Everyone with me? Great. So now we think

3026
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:13,599
Everyone with me? Great. So now we think
 

3027
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:16,069
Everyone with me? Great. So now we think
about how do you want to approximate a

3028
01:07:16,069 --> 01:07:16,079
about how do you want to approximate a
 

3029
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,470
about how do you want to approximate a
function?

3030
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:18,480
function?
 

3031
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,990
function?
So you probably first saw approximating

3032
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:22,000
So you probably first saw approximating
 

3033
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,230
So you probably first saw approximating
functions with other things back when

3034
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:24,240
functions with other things back when
 

3035
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,670
functions with other things back when
you learned calculus, when you learned

3036
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:27,680
you learned calculus, when you learned
 

3037
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,589
you learned calculus, when you learned
things like reman integration, right?

3038
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:29,599
things like reman integration, right?
 

3039
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:30,549
things like reman integration, right?
Right? So when you learned new on

3040
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:30,559
Right? So when you learned new on
 

3041
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:32,630
Right? So when you learned new on
integration, what you did was you took a

3042
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,640
integration, what you did was you took a
 

3043
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,470
integration, what you did was you took a
function and you approximated by a

3044
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:34,480
function and you approximated by a
 

3045
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,190
function and you approximated by a
peace-wise constant function and you

3046
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:37,200
peace-wise constant function and you
 

3047
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,950
peace-wise constant function and you
said hey if I take this function let me

3048
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:38,960
said hey if I take this function let me
 

3049
01:07:38,960 --> 01:08:06,230
said hey if I take this function let me
use another color

3050
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:06,240

 

3051
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:12,630

Lots of different ways to do it.

3052
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:12,640

 

3053
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,309

You get the idea, right? So, this is a

3054
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:14,319
You get the idea, right? So, this is a
 

3055
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:18,630
You get the idea, right? So, this is a
peacewise linear approximation.

3056
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:18,640

 

3057
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,829

Not peacewise linear peace wise

3058
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:19,839
Not peacewise linear peace wise
 

3059
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:32,550
Not peacewise linear peace wise
constant. Peacewise constant.

3060
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:32,560

 

3061
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,229

So when we think about neural nets, we

3062
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:36,239
So when we think about neural nets, we
 

3063
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:37,829
So when we think about neural nets, we
have to think about how we do the

3064
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:37,839
have to think about how we do the
 

3065
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:39,990
have to think about how we do the
approximation and our goal in doing the

3066
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:40,000
approximation and our goal in doing the
 

3067
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,510
approximation and our goal in doing the
approximation

3068
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:41,520
approximation
 

3069
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,030
approximation
is

3070
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:43,040
is
 

3071
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,030
is
there's many fold. We would like to do

3072
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:45,040
there's many fold. We would like to do
 

3073
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,030
there's many fold. We would like to do
the approximation in a way that has good

3074
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:47,040
the approximation in a way that has good
 

3075
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,870
the approximation in a way that has good
approximation properties. We'd like to

3076
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:48,880
approximation properties. We'd like to
 

3077
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,990
approximation properties. We'd like to
be able to approximate the function.

3078
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:50,000
be able to approximate the function.
 

3079
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,030
be able to approximate the function.
Well, we would also like to be able to

3080
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:53,040
Well, we would also like to be able to
 

3081
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,789
Well, we would also like to be able to
do the computations involved in doing

3082
01:08:54,789 --> 01:08:54,799
do the computations involved in doing
 

3083
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:56,950
do the computations involved in doing
the approximation efficiently using

3084
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:56,960
the approximation efficiently using
 

3085
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,070
the approximation efficiently using
linear algebraic uh tools together with

3086
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:00,080
linear algebraic uh tools together with
 

3087
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,390
linear algebraic uh tools together with
other other tools.

3088
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:02,400
other other tools.
 

3089
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,390
other other tools.
And we would also like it to be possible

3090
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:06,400
And we would also like it to be possible
 

3091
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,349
And we would also like it to be possible
to train this neural net to follow

3092
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:09,359
to train this neural net to follow
 

3093
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,510
to train this neural net to follow
approaches like gradient descent to

3094
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:11,520
approaches like gradient descent to
 

3095
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,070
approaches like gradient descent to
actually move the parameters. Okay, so

3096
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:16,080
actually move the parameters. Okay, so
 

3097
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,950
actually move the parameters. Okay, so
peacewise constant is one approximation.

3098
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:18,960
peacewise constant is one approximation.
 

3099
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,030
peacewise constant is one approximation.
But

3100
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:21,040
But
 

3101
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,070
But
we can also have a different

3102
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:22,080
we can also have a different
 

3103
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,990
we can also have a different
approximation, right? We can do

3104
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,000
approximation, right? We can do
 

3105
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,390
approximation, right? We can do
peacewise linear.

3106
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
peacewise linear.
 

3107
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,229
peacewise linear.
So a peacewise linear approximation

3108
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:28,239
So a peacewise linear approximation
 

3109
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:45,110
So a peacewise linear approximation
would look like this.

3110
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:45,120

 

3111
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:59,510

Okay, this is piece wise linear.

3112
01:09:59,510 --> 01:09:59,520

 

3113
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,270

So again, you saw peacewise linear

3114
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:01,280
So again, you saw peacewise linear
 

3115
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,310
So again, you saw peacewise linear
approximations probably when you also in

3116
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:04,320
approximations probably when you also in
 

3117
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,750
approximations probably when you also in
your calculus class where you learned

3118
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:05,760
your calculus class where you learned
 

3119
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,950
your calculus class where you learned
something like trapezoid rule for

3120
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:06,960
something like trapezoid rule for
 

3121
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,110
something like trapezoid rule for
integration, right? These might be

3122
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,120
integration, right? These might be
 

3123
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,030
integration, right? These might be
bringing back memories for what you

3124
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:11,040
bringing back memories for what you
 

3125
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,070
bringing back memories for what you
learned a long time ago. And so you can

3126
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:14,080
learned a long time ago. And so you can
 

3127
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,550
learned a long time ago. And so you can
see at first glance you can see okay

3128
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:16,560
see at first glance you can see okay
 

3129
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,910
see at first glance you can see okay
peacewise linear is a better

3130
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:17,920
peacewise linear is a better
 

3131
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,630
peacewise linear is a better
approximation than peacewise constant.

3132
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:20,640
approximation than peacewise constant.
 

3133
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,510
approximation than peacewise constant.
Um it's what does that mean? It means it

3134
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:23,520
Um it's what does that mean? It means it
 

3135
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,390
Um it's what does that mean? It means it
for the same number of kinks

3136
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:26,400
for the same number of kinks
 

3137
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,270
for the same number of kinks
it is closer to the function.

3138
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:29,280
it is closer to the function.
 

3139
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,750
it is closer to the function.
right in places between the kinks.

3140
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:33,760
right in places between the kinks.
 

3141
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,669
right in places between the kinks.
So that's one aspect of thinking about

3142
01:10:35,669 --> 01:10:35,679
So that's one aspect of thinking about
 

3143
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,669
So that's one aspect of thinking about
approximation is approximation quality.

3144
01:10:37,669 --> 01:10:37,679
approximation is approximation quality.
 

3145
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,630
approximation is approximation quality.
How good of an approximation it is? But

3146
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:40,640
How good of an approximation it is? But
 

3147
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,270
How good of an approximation it is? But
the other thing you care about in uh

3148
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:43,280
the other thing you care about in uh
 

3149
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,750
the other thing you care about in uh
from the neural net perspective is how

3150
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:45,760
from the neural net perspective is how
 

3151
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,070
from the neural net perspective is how
do you represent it? Is it possible to

3152
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:48,080
do you represent it? Is it possible to
 

3153
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,709
do you represent it? Is it possible to
represent peacewise linear approximation

3154
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:50,719
represent peacewise linear approximation
 

3155
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:53,270
represent peacewise linear approximation
using parameters that are friendly for

3156
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:53,280
using parameters that are friendly for
 

3157
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,630
using parameters that are friendly for
optimization and for computation?

3158
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:56,640
optimization and for computation?
 

3159
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,149
optimization and for computation?
Okay.

3160
01:10:58,149 --> 01:10:58,159
Okay.
 

3161
01:10:58,159 --> 01:10:59,910
Okay.
So

3162
01:10:59,910 --> 01:10:59,920
So
 

3163
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,750
So
the question becomes

3164
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:03,760

 

3165
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,149

how

3166
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:06,159
how
 

3167
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,110
how
to represent

3168
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:09,120
to represent
 

3169
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:16,790
to represent
slashparameterize

3170
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:16,800

 

3171
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,709

a peace-wise linear approximation.

3172
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:20,719
a peace-wise linear approximation.
 

3173
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,149
a peace-wise linear approximation.
So what do we need to know? So when you

3174
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:22,159
So what do we need to know? So when you
 

3175
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:23,510
So what do we need to know? So when you
think about parameterization, it's like

3176
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:23,520
think about parameterization, it's like
 

3177
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,950
think about parameterization, it's like
I need to describe this peace-wise

3178
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:24,960
I need to describe this peace-wise
 

3179
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,830
I need to describe this peace-wise
linear approximation using a set of

3180
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
linear approximation using a set of
 

3181
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,630
linear approximation using a set of
numbers such that I given the set of

3182
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:30,640
numbers such that I given the set of
 

3183
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,990
numbers such that I given the set of
numbers, I know how to evaluate the

3184
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,000
numbers, I know how to evaluate the
 

3185
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,870
numbers, I know how to evaluate the
function. Everyone with me? Okay, great.

3186
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:36,880
function. Everyone with me? Okay, great.
 

3187
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,910
function. Everyone with me? Okay, great.
So you can immediately see that in these

3188
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:39,920
So you can immediately see that in these
 

3189
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,830
So you can immediately see that in these
cases there's lots of choices to how to

3190
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:41,840
cases there's lots of choices to how to
 

3191
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,669
cases there's lots of choices to how to
do this, right? There's lots of

3192
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:43,679
do this, right? There's lots of
 

3193
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,510
do this, right? There's lots of
different choices by which you can think

3194
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:45,520
different choices by which you can think
 

3195
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,630
different choices by which you can think
about this peacewise linear

3196
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:46,640
about this peacewise linear
 

3197
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,030
about this peacewise linear
approximation. So the first thing you

3198
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,040
approximation. So the first thing you
 

3199
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,470
approximation. So the first thing you
need to look at in this I may zoom in on

3200
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:50,480
need to look at in this I may zoom in on
 

3201
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,910
need to look at in this I may zoom in on
this piewise linear approximation thing

3202
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:51,920
this piewise linear approximation thing
 

3203
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,390
this piewise linear approximation thing
a little bit zoom in because I want to

3204
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:54,400
a little bit zoom in because I want to
 

3205
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,030
a little bit zoom in because I want to
talk about it.

3206
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,040
talk about it.
 

3207
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,790
talk about it.
So I'll just zoom in

3208
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:00,800

 

3209
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,310

to some piece of it to some little

3210
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:02,320
to some piece of it to some little
 

3211
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,669
to some piece of it to some little
section. Okay.

3212
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:05,679
section. Okay.
 

3213
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:08,070
section. Okay.
So if I think about a peace-wise linear

3214
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:08,080
So if I think about a peace-wise linear
 

3215
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:20,790
So if I think about a peace-wise linear
approximation,

3216
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:20,800

 

3217
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,510

think of this part. What information

3218
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:23,520
think of this part. What information
 

3219
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,310
think of this part. What information
qualitatively do I need to convey about

3220
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:26,320
qualitatively do I need to convey about
 

3221
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,189
qualitatively do I need to convey about
this purple thing so that you can know

3222
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:29,199
this purple thing so that you can know
 

3223
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,950
this purple thing so that you can know
it exactly?

3224
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:30,960
it exactly?
 

3225
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,189
it exactly?
What do I need to know?

3226
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:33,199
What do I need to know?
 

3227
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,709
What do I need to know?
>> Yeah.

3228
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:34,719
>> Yeah.
 

3229
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:35,669
>> Yeah.
size.

3230
01:12:35,669 --> 01:12:35,679
size.
 

3231
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:37,910
size.
>> So I need to know how what do you mean

3232
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:37,920
>> So I need to know how what do you mean
 

3233
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,030
>> So I need to know how what do you mean
by step size?

3234
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:41,040
by step size?
 

3235
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,630
by step size?
>> Okay, so I need to know the lengths,

3236
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:42,640
>> Okay, so I need to know the lengths,
 

3237
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,350
>> Okay, so I need to know the lengths,
right? So I need to know al so one way

3238
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:45,360
right? So I need to know al so one way
 

3239
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,870
right? So I need to know al so one way
of thinking about it is I need to know

3240
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:46,880
of thinking about it is I need to know
 

3241
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,550
of thinking about it is I need to know
where these

3242
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:48,560
where these
 

3243
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,790
where these
kinks are, right? What's the spacing

3244
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:50,800
kinks are, right? What's the spacing
 

3245
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,550
kinks are, right? What's the spacing
between them? So uh is this

3246
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:54,560
between them? So uh is this
 

3247
01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:11,590
between them? So uh is this
>> Yeah, I don't know what I can

3248
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:11,600

 

3249
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,669

so locations of these kinks.

3250
01:13:15,669 --> 01:13:15,679

 

3251
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,030

Okay, what else do I need to know? So

3252
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:17,040
Okay, what else do I need to know? So
 

3253
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:20,070
Okay, what else do I need to know? So
now I know where on the x- axis. So

3254
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:20,080
now I know where on the x- axis. So
 

3255
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,189
now I know where on the x- axis. So
these locations are here,

3256
01:13:23,189 --> 01:13:23,199
these locations are here,
 

3257
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,790
these locations are here,
here,

3258
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:24,800
here,
 

3259
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,870
here,
here, and here. Okay, what else we need

3260
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:28,880
here, and here. Okay, what else we need
 

3261
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,669
here, and here. Okay, what else we need
to know? Yeah.

3262
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:31,679
to know? Yeah.
 

3263
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:41,270
to know? Yeah.
>> The slopes.

3264
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:41,280

 

3265
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,709

Okay. So, slopes.

3266
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:46,719

 

3267
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:49,030

Okay. Good. I know where the kinks are.

3268
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,040
Okay. Good. I know where the kinks are.
 

3269
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,270
Okay. Good. I know where the kinks are.
I need to know where the slopes are.

3270
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
I need to know where the slopes are.
 

3271
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:56,709
I need to know where the slopes are.
What more do I need to know?

3272
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:56,719

 

3273
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,709

>> Is that enough?

3274
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:00,719

 

3275
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,510

I need to know how high this thing is.

3276
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:03,520
I need to know how high this thing is.
 

3277
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,750
I need to know how high this thing is.
Okay, so now this is the first place

3278
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,760
Okay, so now this is the first place
 

3279
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,350
Okay, so now this is the first place
where you should start feeling okay wait

3280
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,360
where you should start feeling okay wait
 

3281
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,149
where you should start feeling okay wait
how much do I need to know? Okay, if I

3282
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:12,159
how much do I need to know? Okay, if I
 

3283
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:15,110
how much do I need to know? Okay, if I
told you the location of the kinks and I

3284
01:14:15,110 --> 01:14:15,120
told you the location of the kinks and I
 

3285
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,510
told you the location of the kinks and I
told you all the slopes and I told you

3286
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:17,520
told you all the slopes and I told you
 

3287
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,030
told you all the slopes and I told you
it was a peace-wise linear

3288
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:19,040
it was a peace-wise linear
 

3289
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,430
it was a peace-wise linear
approximation, meaning it's a continuous

3290
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
approximation, meaning it's a continuous
 

3291
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,550
approximation, meaning it's a continuous
function,

3292
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:24,560

 

3293
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,950

how many y's do I need to know to know

3294
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:26,960
how many y's do I need to know to know
 

3295
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,830
how many y's do I need to know to know
which function it is?

3296
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:29,840
which function it is?
 

3297
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,950
which function it is?
One. I need the height somewhere,

3298
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:32,960
One. I need the height somewhere,
 

3299
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:45,189
One. I need the height somewhere,
right?

3300
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:45,199

 

3301
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:48,149

Okay, so you can kind of see there's

3302
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:48,159
Okay, so you can kind of see there's
 

3303
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,590
Okay, so you can kind of see there's
some kind of information I need to know

3304
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:49,600
some kind of information I need to know
 

3305
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,790
some kind of information I need to know
to understand this uh peacewise linear

3306
01:14:52,790 --> 01:14:52,800
to understand this uh peacewise linear
 

3307
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,229
to understand this uh peacewise linear
function. Okay, now comes the next

3308
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:56,239
function. Okay, now comes the next
 

3309
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:59,430
function. Okay, now comes the next
question.

3310
01:14:59,430 --> 01:14:59,440

 

3311
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,910

How can I represent this information

3312
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:03,920
How can I represent this information
 

3313
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,070
How can I represent this information
in a different way? in a way that's

3314
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:06,080
in a different way? in a way that's
 

3315
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,149
in a different way? in a way that's
convenient for me to apply parallel

3316
01:15:08,149 --> 01:15:08,159
convenient for me to apply parallel
 

3317
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,229
convenient for me to apply parallel
matrix type of computations to do the

3318
01:15:10,229 --> 01:15:10,239
matrix type of computations to do the
 

3319
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,149
matrix type of computations to do the
computation.

3320
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:12,159
computation.
 

3321
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:13,669
computation.
Okay.

3322
01:15:13,669 --> 01:15:13,679
Okay.
 

3323
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,550
Okay.
So I can just describe this this

3324
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
So I can just describe this this
 

3325
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,630
So I can just describe this this
information theoretically I've given if

3326
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:18,640
information theoretically I've given if
 

3327
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,310
information theoretically I've given if
I tell you all this information you can

3328
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:20,320
I tell you all this information you can
 

3329
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,870
I tell you all this information you can
replicate this but that might not be the

3330
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:22,880
replicate this but that might not be the
 

3331
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,070
replicate this but that might not be the
most efficient way to do it.

3332
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:26,080
most efficient way to do it.
 

3333
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,709
most efficient way to do it.
So one of the useful ways to think about

3334
01:15:28,709 --> 01:15:28,719
So one of the useful ways to think about
 

3335
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:30,870
So one of the useful ways to think about
it is

3336
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:30,880
it is
 

3337
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,750
it is
so now we need to think about

3338
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:31,760
so now we need to think about
 

3339
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:49,350
so now we need to think about
implementation a little bit.

3340
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:49,360

 

3341
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,910

So we know the kinds of operations that

3342
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:51,920
So we know the kinds of operations that
 

3343
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:55,030
So we know the kinds of operations that
we know we like to make computers do uh

3344
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:55,040
we know we like to make computers do uh
 

3345
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:59,910
we know we like to make computers do uh
is things like multiply adds right

3346
01:15:59,910 --> 01:15:59,920
is things like multiply adds right
 

3347
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:04,229
is things like multiply adds right
multiplies adds stuff like this.

3348
01:16:04,229 --> 01:16:04,239
multiplies adds stuff like this.
 

3349
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:06,229
multiplies adds stuff like this.
So we would like to implement this kind

3350
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:06,239
So we would like to implement this kind
 

3351
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,590
So we would like to implement this kind
of function so let's call it neural net

3352
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:09,600
of function so let's call it neural net
 

3353
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,830
of function so let's call it neural net
theta of x

3354
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:11,840
theta of x
 

3355
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,990
theta of x
in ways that involve multiplication and

3356
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,000
in ways that involve multiplication and
 

3357
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,390
in ways that involve multiplication and
addition. So one way to think about it

3358
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:16,400
addition. So one way to think about it
 

3359
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,229
addition. So one way to think about it
is to think about it as some kind of a

3360
01:16:18,229 --> 01:16:18,239
is to think about it as some kind of a
 

3361
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:22,149
is to think about it as some kind of a
sum over little little pieces, little

3362
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:22,159
sum over little little pieces, little
 

3363
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,310
sum over little little pieces, little
things.

3364
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:24,320
things.
 

3365
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,830
things.
So I want to sum with weights of some

3366
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:27,840
So I want to sum with weights of some
 

3367
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,510
So I want to sum with weights of some
kind.

3368
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:33,520

 

3369
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:41,030

Maybe I won't use this. I'll use W.

3370
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:41,040

 

3371
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,350

And I'm going to sum up some other

3372
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:43,360
And I'm going to sum up some other
 

3373
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:46,950
And I'm going to sum up some other
functions.

3374
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:46,960

 

3375
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,189

G

3376
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:49,199
G
 

3377
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,669
G
theta tilda I

3378
01:16:51,669 --> 01:16:51,679
theta tilda I
 

3379
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:52,950
theta tilda I
>> write a little bigger.

3380
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:52,960
>> write a little bigger.
 

3381
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,709
>> write a little bigger.
>> Yeah, I should write a little bigger

3382
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:56,719
>> Yeah, I should write a little bigger
 

3383
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:16,310
>> Yeah, I should write a little bigger
>> or even on this

3384
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:16,320

 

3385
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,830

So I think I'd like to be able to

3386
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840
So I think I'd like to be able to
 

3387
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,070
So I think I'd like to be able to
represent a peace-wise linear function

3388
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:20,080
represent a peace-wise linear function
 

3389
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,709
represent a peace-wise linear function
as a sum, a weighted sum. Now why do I

3390
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:22,719
as a sum, a weighted sum. Now why do I
 

3391
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:25,350
as a sum, a weighted sum. Now why do I
like this? Because I know in principle

3392
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:25,360
like this? Because I know in principle
 

3393
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,189
like this? Because I know in principle
that

3394
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:27,199
that
 

3395
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,189
that
this kind of sum type representation is

3396
01:17:29,189 --> 01:17:29,199
this kind of sum type representation is
 

3397
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,030
this kind of sum type representation is
going to have natural parallelism that I

3398
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:31,040
going to have natural parallelism that I
 

3399
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,030
going to have natural parallelism that I
can exploit because I could presumably

3400
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:33,040
can exploit because I could presumably
 

3401
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:37,750
can exploit because I could presumably
compute all of these things in parallel,

3402
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:37,760
compute all of these things in parallel,
 

3403
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,350
compute all of these things in parallel,
multiply them in parallel with their

3404
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:39,360
multiply them in parallel with their
 

3405
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,630
multiply them in parallel with their
individual weights and then add them up.

3406
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:42,640
individual weights and then add them up.
 

3407
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,070
individual weights and then add them up.
Okay, so this is like friendly for

3408
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:44,080
Okay, so this is like friendly for
 

3409
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,510
Okay, so this is like friendly for
computers.

3410
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:45,520
computers.
 

3411
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:49,350
computers.
So you think okay if I wanted to have

3412
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:49,360
So you think okay if I wanted to have
 

3413
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,030
So you think okay if I wanted to have
this kind of information so all this

3414
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:51,040
this kind of information so all this
 

3415
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,790
this kind of information so all this
information that I needed this height

3416
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:54,800
information that I needed this height
 

3417
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,709
information that I needed this height
these slopes

3418
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:56,719
these slopes
 

3419
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:58,950
these slopes
these locations all have to be somehow

3420
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:58,960
these locations all have to be somehow
 

3421
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,709
these locations all have to be somehow
embedded in the learnable parameters

3422
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:02,719
embedded in the learnable parameters
 

3423
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,390
embedded in the learnable parameters
like these weights and whatever these

3424
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:04,400
like these weights and whatever these
 

3425
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,709
like these weights and whatever these
theta tildas are okay so it turns out

3426
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:08,719
theta tildas are okay so it turns out
 

3427
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,550
theta tildas are okay so it turns out
that there's a way of thinking about

3428
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:10,560
that there's a way of thinking about
 

3429
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,430
that there's a way of thinking about
this that's natural and the natural

3430
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:13,440
this that's natural and the natural
 

3431
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,990
this that's natural and the natural
thing is to think about

3432
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,000
thing is to think about
 

3433
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,510
thing is to think about
what this little function in here should

3434
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:17,520
what this little function in here should
 

3435
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,990
what this little function in here should
be like. So you think, hey, wouldn't it

3436
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:20,000
be like. So you think, hey, wouldn't it
 

3437
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,030
be like. So you think, hey, wouldn't it
be nice if I could instead of thinking

3438
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:23,040
be nice if I could instead of thinking
 

3439
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:27,030
be nice if I could instead of thinking
about a function that has arbitrarily

3440
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:27,040
about a function that has arbitrarily
 

3441
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,189
about a function that has arbitrarily
um

3442
01:18:29,189 --> 01:18:29,199
um
 

3443
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:32,070
um
positionable kinks and slopes and so on

3444
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:32,080
positionable kinks and slopes and so on
 

3445
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,390
positionable kinks and slopes and so on
as instead being something that's

3446
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:34,400
as instead being something that's
 

3447
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,950
as instead being something that's
defined this way,

3448
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:36,960
defined this way,
 

3449
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,870
defined this way,
okay? where I have an arbitrarily

3450
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:38,880
okay? where I have an arbitrarily
 

3451
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,669
okay? where I have an arbitrarily
positionable kink

3452
01:18:43,669 --> 01:18:43,679

 

3453
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,229

elbow

3454
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:46,239
elbow
 

3455
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:51,990
elbow
and a slope.

3456
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:52,000

 

3457
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,910

So if you think about it, if I add

3458
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:53,920
So if you think about it, if I add
 

3459
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,830
So if you think about it, if I add
together a bunch of functions that are

3460
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:55,840
together a bunch of functions that are
 

3461
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:00,070
together a bunch of functions that are
all sort of flat and have a some slope

3462
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:00,080
all sort of flat and have a some slope
 

3463
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,350
all sort of flat and have a some slope
that I can modulate, then I could

3464
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:03,360
that I can modulate, then I could
 

3465
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,669
that I can modulate, then I could
certainly start at zero, go up, and then

3466
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:05,679
certainly start at zero, go up, and then
 

3467
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,350
certainly start at zero, go up, and then
change my slope later by adding a

3468
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:07,360
change my slope later by adding a
 

3469
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,630
change my slope later by adding a
different function that moves the slope

3470
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:08,640
different function that moves the slope
 

3471
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,390
different function that moves the slope
down.

3472
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:10,400
down.
 

3473
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,669
down.
You see how I could construct things

3474
01:19:11,669 --> 01:19:11,679
You see how I could construct things
 

3475
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:15,110
You see how I could construct things
this way? Okay, so this is nice. This

3476
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:15,120
this way? Okay, so this is nice. This
 

3477
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,390
this way? Okay, so this is nice. This
gives us a a way to do that. Now the

3478
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
gives us a a way to do that. Now the
 

3479
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,270
gives us a a way to do that. Now the
great thing is that these kind of

3480
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:21,280
great thing is that these kind of
 

3481
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,950
great thing is that these kind of
functions

3482
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:22,960
functions
 

3483
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,030
functions
can be put together out of even simpler

3484
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:25,040
can be put together out of even simpler
 

3485
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,229
can be put together out of even simpler
things. So this kind of function what is

3486
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:28,239
things. So this kind of function what is
 

3487
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:32,070
things. So this kind of function what is
this? This kind of function is a

3488
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:32,080
this? This kind of function is a
 

3489
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,229
this? This kind of function is a
a max

3490
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:34,239
a max
 

3491
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,310
a max
of zero

3492
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:36,320
of zero
 

3493
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:39,030
of zero
and

3494
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:39,040
and
 

3495
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,350
and
some

3496
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:41,360
some
 

3497
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,630
some
wx

3498
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:44,640

 

3499
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,950

plus b. There's a straight line

3500
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:46,960
plus b. There's a straight line
 

3501
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,750
plus b. There's a straight line
somewhere. So it's defined by wx plus b.

3502
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:49,760
somewhere. So it's defined by wx plus b.
 

3503
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,229
somewhere. So it's defined by wx plus b.
This is a max in this. So this kind of

3504
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:52,239
This is a max in this. So this kind of
 

3505
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:54,390
This is a max in this. So this kind of
operation max zero something is what the

3506
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:54,400
operation max zero something is what the
 

3507
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,430
operation max zero something is what the
relu is

3508
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:57,440
relu is
 

3509
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:01,270
relu is
rectified linear units.

3510
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:01,280
rectified linear units.
 

3511
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:05,430
rectified linear units.
And next time we uh you'll you'll see

3512
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:05,440
And next time we uh you'll you'll see
 

3513
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,830
And next time we uh you'll you'll see
how to connect this kind of thing to

3514
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:07,840
how to connect this kind of thing to
 

3515
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,550
how to connect this kind of thing to
more linear algebra and set everything

3516
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560
more linear algebra and set everything
 

3517
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,110
more linear algebra and set everything
up so you can see the approximation of

3518
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:13,120
up so you can see the approximation of
 

3519
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,189
up so you can see the approximation of
this. Okay, because we're out of time.

3520
01:20:15,189 --> 01:20:15,199
this. Okay, because we're out of time.
 

3521
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:18,149
this. Okay, because we're out of time.
Um, we have office hours in 400 Corey.

3522
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:18,159
Um, we have office hours in 400 Corey.
 

3523
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:19,669
Um, we have office hours in 400 Corey.
Um, there's another class immediately

3524
01:20:19,669 --> 01:20:19,679
Um, there's another class immediately
 

3525
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:22,070
Um, there's another class immediately
after us, so we can't really answer too

3526
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080
after us, so we can't really answer too
 

3527
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,470
after us, so we can't really answer too
many questions here. Maybe a couple one

3528
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:24,480
many questions here. Maybe a couple one
 

3529
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:29,000
many questions here. Maybe a couple one
minute, but then we have to move up.
