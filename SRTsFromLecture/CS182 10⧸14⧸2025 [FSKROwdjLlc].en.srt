1
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,149

finish up uh graph neural nets and move

2
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
finish up uh graph neural nets and move
 

3
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,750
finish up uh graph neural nets and move
into RNN's. Just a comment on where we

4
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
into RNN's. Just a comment on where we
 

5
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,590
into RNN's. Just a comment on where we
are relative to the reading. If you

6
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
are relative to the reading. If you
 

7
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,229
are relative to the reading. If you
think about the Prince uh textbook,

8
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
think about the Prince uh textbook,
 

9
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,510
think about the Prince uh textbook,
uh chapters through chapter 11 is all

10
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
uh chapters through chapter 11 is all
 

11
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,950
uh chapters through chapter 11 is all
the connet stuff. Chapter 13 is the GNN

12
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
the connet stuff. Chapter 13 is the GNN
 

13
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,189
the connet stuff. Chapter 13 is the GNN
stuff. Nothing in this lecture is in the

14
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
stuff. Nothing in this lecture is in the
 

15
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,550
stuff. Nothing in this lecture is in the
prince textbook um at all. The older RNN

16
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
prince textbook um at all. The older RNN
 

17
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,390
prince textbook um at all. The older RNN
material that I will be hope getting to

18
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
material that I will be hope getting to
 

19
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,990
material that I will be hope getting to
at the end is you can find it in this uh

20
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
at the end is you can find it in this uh
 

21
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,030
at the end is you can find it in this uh
textbook the deep learningbook.org.

22
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
textbook the deep learningbook.org.
 

23
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,430
textbook the deep learningbook.org.
This is an older textbook but the

24
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
This is an older textbook but the
 

25
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,270
This is an older textbook but the
coverage of the classical RNN material

26
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
coverage of the classical RNN material
 

27
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,430
coverage of the classical RNN material
is quite good.

28
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
is quite good.
 

29
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,469
is quite good.
Uh so but the perspectives we'll be

30
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
Uh so but the perspectives we'll be
 

31
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,469
Uh so but the perspectives we'll be
giving here are definitely different

32
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
giving here are definitely different
 

33
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,950
giving here are definitely different
than the classical perspectives. So

34
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
than the classical perspectives. So
 

35
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,790
than the classical perspectives. So
the project information I know I said

36
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
the project information I know I said
 

37
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,070
the project information I know I said
that I'd announced we'd have the

38
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
that I'd announced we'd have the
 

39
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,189
that I'd announced we'd have the
information up on Friday. There was a

40
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
information up on Friday. There was a
 

41
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,790
information up on Friday. There was a
little bit of delay. We'll it'll go up

42
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
little bit of delay. We'll it'll go up
 

43
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,909
little bit of delay. We'll it'll go up
today but a couple of key points that we

44
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
today but a couple of key points that we
 

45
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,350
today but a couple of key points that we
wanted to just make sure everyone is

46
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
wanted to just make sure everyone is
 

47
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,629
wanted to just make sure everyone is
aware of by announcing them in lecture.

48
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
aware of by announcing them in lecture.
 

49
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,790
aware of by announcing them in lecture.
The project has many many different

50
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
The project has many many different
 

51
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,430
The project has many many different
stages uh for of things you have to do.

52
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
stages uh for of things you have to do.
 

53
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,270
stages uh for of things you have to do.
The

54
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
The
 

55
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,710
The
proposals from you uh and teaming in

56
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
proposals from you uh and teaming in
 

57
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,230
proposals from you uh and teaming in
groups of four will be due on November

58
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
groups of four will be due on November
 

59
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,710
groups of four will be due on November
3rd. So we'll give you details of what

60
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
3rd. So we'll give you details of what
 

61
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,150
3rd. So we'll give you details of what
you're supposed to write in that

62
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
you're supposed to write in that
 

63
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,390
you're supposed to write in that
proposal. Um you'll have to do work to

64
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
proposal. Um you'll have to do work to
 

65
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,590
proposal. Um you'll have to do work to
to make that proposal. Ahead of that

66
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
to make that proposal. Ahead of that
 

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,749

we have required meetings for all of
 

71
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,629
we have required meetings for all of
you. So every project group has to sign

00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
you. So every project group has to sign
 

73
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,790
you. So every project group has to sign
up for a meeting slot. come to office

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
up for a meeting slot. come to office
 

75
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,790
up for a meeting slot. come to office
hours or sign up for a slot that will

76
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
hours or sign up for a slot that will
 

77
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,230
hours or sign up for a slot that will
make available have signups available

78
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
make available have signups available
 

79
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,350
make available have signups available
for you to talk ahead of your proposal

80
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
for you to talk ahead of your proposal
 

81
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,510
for you to talk ahead of your proposal
and then you will have submit your

82
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
and then you will have submit your
 

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,950
and then you will have submit your
proposal and then there'll be another

84
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
proposal and then there'll be another
 

85
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,790
proposal and then there'll be another
meeting with the TAS the following week

86
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
meeting with the TAS the following week
 

87
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,310
meeting with the TAS the following week
the week immediately after the proposal

88
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,320
the week immediately after the proposal
 

89
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,629
the week immediately after the proposal
submission for you to get some feedback

90
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
submission for you to get some feedback
 

91
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,870
submission for you to get some feedback
and to discuss because the process of

92
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
and to discuss because the process of
 

93
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,390
and to discuss because the process of
writing the proposal and thinking it

94
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
writing the proposal and thinking it
 

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,590
writing the proposal and thinking it
through helps you understand what needs

96
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
through helps you understand what needs
 

97
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,909
through helps you understand what needs
to happen. There will be other

98
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
to happen. There will be other
 

99
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,469
to happen. There will be other
deadlines. In particular, a draft

100
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
deadlines. In particular, a draft
 

101
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,270
deadlines. In particular, a draft
report, final report for your project

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
will be due the week right before
 

105
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,309
will be due the week right before
Thanksgiving. You will ask be expected

106
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
Thanksgiving. You will ask be expected
 

107
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,070
Thanksgiving. You will ask be expected
to do peer review and then you'll have

108
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
to do peer review and then you'll have
 

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,510
to do peer review and then you'll have
time between that and the last day of

110
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
time between that and the last day of
 

111
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,230
time between that and the last day of
class to actually finalize your project

112
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
class to actually finalize your project
 

113
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,830
class to actually finalize your project
report.

114
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
report.
 

115
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,510
report.
There will then be a a poster

116
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
There will then be a a poster
 

117
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,710
There will then be a a poster
presentation you can do in RR week in

118
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
presentation you can do in RR week in
 

119
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,950
presentation you can do in RR week in
this slot. Okay. Okay, so this is like

120
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
this slot. Okay. Okay, so this is like
 

121
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,070
this slot. Okay. Okay, so this is like
all this will be outlined in the post,

122
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
all this will be outlined in the post,
 

123
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,270
all this will be outlined in the post,
but I want to make you aware of what

124
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
but I want to make you aware of what
 

125
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,390
but I want to make you aware of what
things are coming on the project.

126
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
things are coming on the project.
 

127
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,950
things are coming on the project.
Okay, so you know we're going to be

128
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
Okay, so you know we're going to be
 

129
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,550
Okay, so you know we're going to be
transitioning from graph neural nets to

130
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
transitioning from graph neural nets to
 

131
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,110
transitioning from graph neural nets to
RNN. So just we just uh continue with

132
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
RNN. So just we just uh continue with
 

133
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,670
RNN. So just we just uh continue with
the RNN GNN discussion. So everyone

134
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
the RNN GNN discussion. So everyone
 

135
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,950
the RNN GNN discussion. So everyone
remembers we want to generalize

136
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
remembers we want to generalize
 

137
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,430
remembers we want to generalize
convolutional net ideas to graphs. We

138
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
convolutional net ideas to graphs. We
 

139
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,870
convolutional net ideas to graphs. We
figured out how to generalize many

140
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
figured out how to generalize many
 

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,150
figured out how to generalize many
ideas. Um we saw that if you had

142
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
ideas. Um we saw that if you had
 

143
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,870
ideas. Um we saw that if you had
directed graphs with edge labels, we

144
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
directed graphs with edge labels, we
 

145
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,469
directed graphs with edge labels, we
were good. you could just use everything

146
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
were good. you could just use everything
 

147
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,990
were good. you could just use everything
you learned for a CNN. U

148
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
you learned for a CNN. U
 

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,469
you learned for a CNN. U
but there was one exception which was

150
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
but there was one exception which was
 

151
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,469
but there was one exception which was
you didn't know what to do about pooling

152
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
you didn't know what to do about pooling
 

153
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,990
you didn't know what to do about pooling
and downsampling that we said there

154
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,000
and downsampling that we said there
 

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,629
and downsampling that we said there
seemed to be no uh general solution that

156
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
seemed to be no uh general solution that
 

157
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,430
seemed to be no uh general solution that
wasn't problem specific.

158
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
wasn't problem specific.
 

159
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,710
wasn't problem specific.
So then we said look we talked about

160
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
So then we said look we talked about
 

161
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,589
So then we said look we talked about
this case directed graphs with finite

162
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
this case directed graphs with finite
 

163
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,909
this case directed graphs with finite
set of edge labels for which CNN ideas

164
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
set of edge labels for which CNN ideas
 

165
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,150
set of edge labels for which CNN ideas
would just generalize directly and but

166
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,160
would just generalize directly and but
 

167
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,270
would just generalize directly and but
the hard thing was this corner which was

168
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
the hard thing was this corner which was
 

169
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,510
the hard thing was this corner which was
undirected graphs with no labels and

170
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
undirected graphs with no labels and
 

171
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,870
undirected graphs with no labels and
that's what we said okay you have to

172
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:44,880
that's what we said okay you have to
 

173
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,469
that's what we said okay you have to
somehow use the information in the

174
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
somehow use the information in the
 

175
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,550
somehow use the information in the
vectors uh and the neighborhood

176
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
vectors uh and the neighborhood
 

177
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,710
vectors uh and the neighborhood
structure to make your decisions. So we

178
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
structure to make your decisions. So we
 

179
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,550
structure to make your decisions. So we
followed that and we said look you know

180
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
followed that and we said look you know
 

181
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,909
followed that and we said look you know
just thinking through different things

182
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
just thinking through different things
 

183
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,110
just thinking through different things
you could do making certain choices of

184
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
you could do making certain choices of
 

185
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,510
you could do making certain choices of
how things are allowed we got to some

186
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
how things are allowed we got to some
 

187
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,869
how things are allowed we got to some
architecture like this that is one thing

188
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
architecture like this that is one thing
 

189
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,150
architecture like this that is one thing
you could do there's many things you

190
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
you could do there's many things you
 

191
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,670
you could do there's many things you
could do but wanted to help you think

192
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
could do but wanted to help you think
 

193
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,230
could do but wanted to help you think
through how the constraints of what

194
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,240
through how the constraints of what
 

195
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,070
through how the constraints of what
you're allowed to do force you to think

196
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
you're allowed to do force you to think
 

197
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,790
you're allowed to do force you to think
about the actual range of possibilities

198
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
about the actual range of possibilities
 

199
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,950
about the actual range of possibilities
okay and then using analogies to things

200
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
okay and then using analogies to things
 

201
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,990
okay and then using analogies to things
you see in machine learning

202
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
you see in machine learning
 

203
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,070
you see in machine learning
okay So now we want to talk about the

204
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
okay So now we want to talk about the
 

205
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,309
okay So now we want to talk about the
thing that did not generalize which is

206
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
thing that did not generalize which is
 

207
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,070
thing that did not generalize which is
pooling and downsampling which is a key

208
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
pooling and downsampling which is a key
 

209
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,589
pooling and downsampling which is a key
challenge.

210
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
challenge.
 

211
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,629
challenge.
So as we talk about this the first thing

212
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
So as we talk about this the first thing
 

213
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,190
So as we talk about this the first thing
I want to do is to ask this question why

214
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
I want to do is to ask this question why
 

215
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,310
I want to do is to ask this question why
do we pull anyway? What was the point of

216
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
do we pull anyway? What was the point of
 

217
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,709
do we pull anyway? What was the point of
pooling? So this is like a

218
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
pooling? So this is like a
 

219
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,750
pooling? So this is like a
okay someone we talked about having

220
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
okay someone we talked about having
 

221
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,670
okay someone we talked about having
downsampling and pooling. What was the

222
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
downsampling and pooling. What was the
 

223
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,230
downsampling and pooling. What was the
motivation we had for introducing

224
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,240
motivation we had for introducing
 

225
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,550
motivation we had for introducing
downsampling and pooling?

226
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
downsampling and pooling?
 

227
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,350
downsampling and pooling?
>> Yeah.

228
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
>> Yeah.
 

229
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,949
>> Yeah.
>> So lowering the resolution is what

230
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
>> So lowering the resolution is what
 

231
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,430
>> So lowering the resolution is what
downsampling and pooling does. But why

232
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
downsampling and pooling does. But why
 

233
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,110
downsampling and pooling does. But why
did we want to lower the resolution

234
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
did we want to lower the resolution
 

235
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,790
did we want to lower the resolution
while we were doing processing? What was

236
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
while we were doing processing? What was
 

237
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,710
while we were doing processing? What was
the point of doing that? Yeah, in the

238
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
the point of doing that? Yeah, in the
 

239
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,389
the point of doing that? Yeah, in the
back.

240
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399

 

241
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,110

>> So one possible solution is that this

242
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
>> So one possible solution is that this
 

243
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,509
>> So one possible solution is that this
would make let us use fewer parameters

244
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
would make let us use fewer parameters
 

245
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,670
would make let us use fewer parameters
to process a down sampled image.

246
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
to process a down sampled image.
 

247
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,790
to process a down sampled image.
However, what we saw that we did was

248
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
However, what we saw that we did was
 

249
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,870
However, what we saw that we did was
whenever we would down sample, we would

250
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
whenever we would down sample, we would
 

251
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,269
whenever we would down sample, we would
add more channels. So the actual

252
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
add more channels. So the actual
 

253
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,110
add more channels. So the actual
parameter count needed to process all

254
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
parameter count needed to process all
 

255
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,550
parameter count needed to process all
that stuff was not really going down

256
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
that stuff was not really going down
 

257
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,670
that stuff was not really going down
because we had already had weight

258
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
because we had already had weight
 

259
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,269
because we had already had weight
sharing across space. In fact, it seemed

260
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
sharing across space. In fact, it seemed
 

261
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,470
sharing across space. In fact, it seemed
to be going up.

262
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
to be going up.
 

263
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,870
to be going up.
Okay, so the it wasn't a parameter count

264
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
Okay, so the it wasn't a parameter count
 

265
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,670
Okay, so the it wasn't a parameter count
motivation for for doing this. So who

266
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
motivation for for doing this. So who
 

267
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:52,310
motivation for for doing this. So who
who remembers why do we do down? Yeah.

268
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320

 

269
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,550

>> Okay, great. So this was the idea that

270
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
>> Okay, great. So this was the idea that
 

271
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,350
>> Okay, great. So this was the idea that
we wanted to capture attributes of the

272
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
we wanted to capture attributes of the
 

273
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,509
we wanted to capture attributes of the
image that existed at a larger spatial

274
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
image that existed at a larger spatial
 

275
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,389
image that existed at a larger spatial
scale. And to have larger spatial scale,

276
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
scale. And to have larger spatial scale,
 

277
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,230
scale. And to have larger spatial scale,
we had to have receptive fields that

278
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
we had to have receptive fields that
 

279
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,030
we had to have receptive fields that
were large enough to capture that scale.

280
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
were large enough to capture that scale.
 

281
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,269
were large enough to capture that scale.
And if we did that using only small

282
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
And if we did that using only small
 

283
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,030
And if we did that using only small
cons, we would need lots of layers to

284
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
cons, we would need lots of layers to
 

285
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,430
cons, we would need lots of layers to
get receptive fields that big and it

286
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
get receptive fields that big and it
 

287
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,269
get receptive fields that big and it
wouldn't really be capturing the

288
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
wouldn't really be capturing the
 

289
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,790
wouldn't really be capturing the
inductive bias we wanted, which is to

290
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
inductive bias we wanted, which is to
 

291
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,550
inductive bias we wanted, which is to
actually capture a bunch of stuff in a

292
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
actually capture a bunch of stuff in a
 

293
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,550
actually capture a bunch of stuff in a
larger way. Downsampling allowed us to

294
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
larger way. Downsampling allowed us to
 

295
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,670
larger way. Downsampling allowed us to
do that. Okay, so if you think about it,

296
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
do that. Okay, so if you think about it,
 

297
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,310
do that. Okay, so if you think about it,
let's say

298
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
let's say
 

299
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,470
let's say
use a different color.

300
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480

 

301
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,910

We want to grow the receptive fields.

302
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920

 

303
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,310

faster

304
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
faster
 

305
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,269
faster
with layers.

306
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279

 

307
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,949

So what that means you want so we

308
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
So what that means you want so we
 

309
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,470
So what that means you want so we
translate this idea into a graph. Okay,

310
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
translate this idea into a graph. Okay,
 

311
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,870
translate this idea into a graph. Okay,
let's translate this idea into a graph.

312
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
let's translate this idea into a graph.
 

313
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,590
let's translate this idea into a graph.
In a graph the same principle might be

314
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
In a graph the same principle might be
 

315
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,069
In a graph the same principle might be
useful. It is the idea that on a graph

316
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
useful. It is the idea that on a graph
 

317
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,150
useful. It is the idea that on a graph
when you're passing messages, right,

318
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
when you're passing messages, right,
 

319
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,509
when you're passing messages, right,
which is what we said you're going to be

320
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
which is what we said you're going to be
 

321
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,790
which is what we said you're going to be
doing. Everyone looks at their

322
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
doing. Everyone looks at their
 

323
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,590
doing. Everyone looks at their
neighbors. Uh

324
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
neighbors. Uh
 

325
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,750
neighbors. Uh
it takes you a while to get any

326
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
it takes you a while to get any
 

327
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,829
it takes you a while to get any
information from far away in the graph.

328
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:13,839
information from far away in the graph.
 

329
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,350
information from far away in the graph.
It has to go through many many many

330
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,360
It has to go through many many many
 

331
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,790
It has to go through many many many
steps of processing before it gets to

332
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
steps of processing before it gets to
 

333
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,829
steps of processing before it gets to
you. Same as in a connet having 3x3 cons

334
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
you. Same as in a connet having 3x3 cons
 

335
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,990
you. Same as in a connet having 3x3 cons
only grows the field by one every time.

336
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
only grows the field by one every time.
 

337
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,150
only grows the field by one every time.
So if you wanted to get information from

338
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
So if you wanted to get information from
 

339
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,069
So if you wanted to get information from
a distant part of the graph to make it

340
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
a distant part of the graph to make it
 

341
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,790
a distant part of the graph to make it
available, you want to do something. Did

342
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
available, you want to do something. Did
 

343
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,710
available, you want to do something. Did
everyone see that? So that's that that

344
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
everyone see that? So that's that that
 

345
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,630
everyone see that? So that's that that
motivation doesn't go away just because

346
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
motivation doesn't go away just because
 

347
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,470
motivation doesn't go away just because
we're in a graph neural network. And

348
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
we're in a graph neural network. And
 

349
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,069
we're in a graph neural network. And
that motivation remains one that we're

350
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
that motivation remains one that we're
 

351
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,310
that motivation remains one that we're
generically interested in. Lots of

352
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,320
generically interested in. Lots of
 

353
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,590
generically interested in. Lots of
different problems might want to have

354
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
different problems might want to have
 

355
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,829
different problems might want to have
this kind of global structure available

356
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
this kind of global structure available
 

357
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,310
this kind of global structure available
to us.

358
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
to us.
 

359
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,269
to us.
Okay. So if you think about it, uh

360
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279

 

361
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,550

there is one solution to this problem

362
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
there is one solution to this problem
 

363
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,230
there is one solution to this problem
that I want to mention before we talk

364
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
that I want to mention before we talk
 

365
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,389
that I want to mention before we talk
about it's very natural in the graph

366
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:00,399
about it's very natural in the graph
 

367
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,430
about it's very natural in the graph
neural net uh that's different than what

368
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
neural net uh that's different than what
 

369
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,509
neural net uh that's different than what
we would do in a connet.

370
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
we would do in a connet.
 

371
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,350
we would do in a connet.
Okay. So if you wanted to have

372
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
Okay. So if you wanted to have
 

373
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,949
Okay. So if you wanted to have
information come from far away in the

374
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
information come from far away in the
 

375
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,470
information come from far away in the
network and be visible to you,

376
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
network and be visible to you,
 

377
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,030
network and be visible to you,
we can do something different because

378
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
we can do something different because
 

379
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,350
we can do something different because
the graph we we did a graph neural net.

380
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
the graph we we did a graph neural net.
 

381
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,269
the graph we we did a graph neural net.
We chose to do the processing in a way

382
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
We chose to do the processing in a way
 

383
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,949
We chose to do the processing in a way
that respected the graph topology

384
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
that respected the graph topology
 

385
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,230
that respected the graph topology
because we thought the graph topology

386
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
because we thought the graph topology
 

387
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,030
because we thought the graph topology
was useful. Same as in a content

388
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
was useful. Same as in a content
 

389
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,470
was useful. Same as in a content
but we get to choose what the topology

390
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
but we get to choose what the topology
 

391
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,750
but we get to choose what the topology
is for processing.

392
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
is for processing.
 

393
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,470
is for processing.
So unhack.

394
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
So unhack.
 

395
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,150
So unhack.
So let's describe it as a hack

396
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160

 

397
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,949

hack

398
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
hack
 

399
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,030
hack
for GNN's.

400
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040

 

401
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,629

If it's taking a long time for

402
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
If it's taking a long time for
 

403
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,710
If it's taking a long time for
information to come from distant parts

404
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
information to come from distant parts
 

405
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,470
information to come from distant parts
of the graph, we can add a node that's

406
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
of the graph, we can add a node that's
 

407
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,150
of the graph, we can add a node that's
connected to the entire graph.

408
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
connected to the entire graph.
 

409
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,030
connected to the entire graph.
Okay.

410
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
Okay.
 

411
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:27,430
Okay.
Add a fake node.

412
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:27,440

 

413
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,509

So, does everyone see the idea here? You

414
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
So, does everyone see the idea here? You
 

415
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,829
So, does everyone see the idea here? You
want information to flow from far away

416
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
want information to flow from far away
 

417
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,590
want information to flow from far away
to you. So you say everything

418
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
to you. So you say everything
 

419
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,430
to you. So you say everything
there's a fake global node that has been

420
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
there's a fake global node that has been
 

421
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,190
there's a fake global node that has been
added. It wasn't in the original graph.

422
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,200
added. It wasn't in the original graph.
 

423
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,470
added. It wasn't in the original graph.
It's added. It's connected to

424
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
It's added. It's connected to
 

425
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,949
It's added. It's connected to
everything. And so in one step of

426
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:44,959
everything. And so in one step of
 

427
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,110
everything. And so in one step of
processing one layer all the information

428
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
processing one layer all the information
 

429
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,829
processing one layer all the information
will flow to the global node. Then in

430
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:49,839
will flow to the global node. Then in
 

431
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,150
will flow to the global node. Then in
the next phase all information processed

432
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
the next phase all information processed
 

433
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,590
the next phase all information processed
aggregated in some way at the global

434
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
aggregated in some way at the global
 

435
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,310
aggregated in some way at the global
node will then flow back to everybody.

436
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
node will then flow back to everybody.
 

437
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,110
node will then flow back to everybody.
Everyone see this at at the level of

438
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,120
Everyone see this at at the level of
 

439
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,350
Everyone see this at at the level of
receptive fields just thinking about

440
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
receptive fields just thinking about
 

441
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,829
receptive fields just thinking about
where the information comes from. This

442
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
where the information comes from. This
 

443
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,069
where the information comes from. This
solves the problem because now the

444
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
solves the problem because now the
 

445
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,030
solves the problem because now the
receptive field is everything at after

446
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
receptive field is everything at after
 

447
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,750
receptive field is everything at after
layer two.

448
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,760
layer two.
 

449
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,670
layer two.
Okay. Any questions on this as a hack

450
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
Okay. Any questions on this as a hack
 

451
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,590
Okay. Any questions on this as a hack
idea?

452
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
idea?
 

453
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:30,550
idea?
Yeah.

454
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560

 

455
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,230

>> So, great question. Okay, so you a

456
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
>> So, great question. Okay, so you a
 

457
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,829
>> So, great question. Okay, so you a
couple of different questions here. So,

458
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
couple of different questions here. So,
 

459
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,269
couple of different questions here. So,
things I'll parse them out. First

460
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
things I'll parse them out. First
 

461
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,350
things I'll parse them out. First
comment was, do you really want it to

462
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
comment was, do you really want it to
 

463
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,829
comment was, do you really want it to
suddenly have it be everything in the

464
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:39,839
suddenly have it be everything in the
 

465
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,470
suddenly have it be everything in the
graph? This is like at a generic graph,

466
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
graph? This is like at a generic graph,
 

467
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,990
graph? This is like at a generic graph,
there's two things that you have access

468
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
there's two things that you have access
 

469
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,629
there's two things that you have access
to. local structure because that's

470
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639
to. local structure because that's
 

471
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,710
to. local structure because that's
visible in your graph and everything

472
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
visible in your graph and everything
 

473
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,550
visible in your graph and everything
right there's nothing intermediate

474
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
right there's nothing intermediate
 

475
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,069
right there's nothing intermediate
whereas in images you have a natural

476
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
whereas in images you have a natural
 

477
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,829
whereas in images you have a natural
sense of okay like down sample it by a

478
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:55,839
sense of okay like down sample it by a
 

479
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,069
sense of okay like down sample it by a
factor of four this is you know like

480
00:14:58,069 --> 00:14:58,079
factor of four this is you know like
 

481
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,310
factor of four this is you know like
local structure but not very far does

482
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
local structure but not very far does
 

483
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,829
local structure but not very far does
everyone see that so this is a very

484
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
everyone see that so this is a very
 

485
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,990
everyone see that so this is a very
coarse instrument

486
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
coarse instrument
 

487
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,910
coarse instrument
that it just says okay we can just get

488
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
that it just says okay we can just get
 

489
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,069
that it just says okay we can just get
to global which might not be what we

490
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
to global which might not be what we
 

491
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,230
to global which might not be what we
want if we wanted to have intermediate

492
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
want if we wanted to have intermediate
 

493
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,470
want if we wanted to have intermediate
level things be uh discovered that are

494
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
level things be uh discovered that are
 

495
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,389
level things be uh discovered that are
useful for processing for generality on

496
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:16,399
useful for processing for generality on
 

497
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,829
useful for processing for generality on
this graph. That was point one. Point

498
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
this graph. That was point one. Point
 

499
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,670
this graph. That was point one. Point
two that was made was that

500
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:23,680
two that was made was that
 

501
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,350
two that was made was that
if you introduced this global node and

502
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360
if you introduced this global node and
 

503
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,949
if you introduced this global node and
you had embeddings let's say that were

504
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
you had embeddings let's say that were
 

505
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,710
you had embeddings let's say that were
threedimensional

506
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
threedimensional
 

507
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,829
threedimensional
at some point what is this global node

508
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
at some point what is this global node
 

509
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,910
at some point what is this global node
going to do with information that's

510
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:35,920
going to do with information that's
 

511
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,230
going to do with information that's
coming from a thousand different nodes

512
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
coming from a thousand different nodes
 

513
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,790
coming from a thousand different nodes
in the graph?

514
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
in the graph?
 

515
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,430
in the graph?
It has to squash all of that information

516
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
It has to squash all of that information
 

517
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,230
It has to squash all of that information
down into a three-dimensional embedding

518
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
down into a three-dimensional embedding
 

519
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,230
down into a three-dimensional embedding
that will then go out to everybody else.

520
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
that will then go out to everybody else.
 

521
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,590
that will then go out to everybody else.
Does everyone see this second point?

522
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
Does everyone see this second point?
 

523
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,749
Does everyone see this second point?
Okay, this second point is actually a

524
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
Okay, this second point is actually a
 

525
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,550
Okay, this second point is actually a
generic problem in graph neural networks

526
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
generic problem in graph neural networks
 

527
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,430
generic problem in graph neural networks
and it's called oversquashing.

528
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
and it's called oversquashing.
 

529
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,870
and it's called oversquashing.
Okay, literally that's the term it's

530
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
Okay, literally that's the term it's
 

531
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,110
Okay, literally that's the term it's
called overs squashing.

532
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
called overs squashing.
 

533
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:21,430
called overs squashing.
So aside talk about overs squashing.

534
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440

 

535
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,509

So overquashing refers to the problem of

536
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
So overquashing refers to the problem of
 

537
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,829
So overquashing refers to the problem of
lots of information that you want to

538
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
lots of information that you want to
 

539
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,470
lots of information that you want to
collect into one place getting squashed

540
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
collect into one place getting squashed
 

541
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,389
collect into one place getting squashed
into a smaller dimensional embedding and

542
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:32,399
into a smaller dimensional embedding and
 

543
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,509
into a smaller dimensional embedding and
therefore lost. So you can't you in

544
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
therefore lost. So you can't you in
 

545
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,509
therefore lost. So you can't you in
principle can see everything far away

546
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
principle can see everything far away
 

547
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,389
principle can see everything far away
but all the details are gone that you

548
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
but all the details are gone that you
 

549
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,030
but all the details are gone that you
need because everything has been forced

550
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,040
need because everything has been forced
 

551
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,310
need because everything has been forced
to go through a small dimensional

552
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
to go through a small dimensional
 

553
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,629
to go through a small dimensional
embedding. Does everyone here understand

554
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
embedding. Does everyone here understand
 

555
00:16:46,639 --> 00:17:17,990
embedding. Does everyone here understand
the kind of vague idea of it?

556
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000

 

557
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,669

So in graph neural nets there's two

558
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
So in graph neural nets there's two
 

559
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,150
So in graph neural nets there's two
problems. One is the overs squashing

560
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
problems. One is the overs squashing
 

561
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,230
problems. One is the overs squashing
problem which is that too much

562
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
problem which is that too much
 

563
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,150
problem which is that too much
information flowing through a bottleneck

564
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
information flowing through a bottleneck
 

565
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,070
information flowing through a bottleneck
gets squished down and details get lost.

566
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
gets squished down and details get lost.
 

567
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,830
gets squished down and details get lost.
And another problem is called over

568
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
And another problem is called over
 

569
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,750
And another problem is called over
smoothing which we talked about before

570
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
smoothing which we talked about before
 

571
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,950
smoothing which we talked about before
which is that because of the limits on

572
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:36,960
which is that because of the limits on
 

573
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,390
which is that because of the limits on
what you can do you end up just doing

574
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
what you can do you end up just doing
 

575
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,669
what you can do you end up just doing
averaging averaging averaging and

576
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
averaging averaging averaging and
 

577
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,909
averaging averaging averaging and
smoothing things out. Okay for example

578
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
smoothing things out. Okay for example
 

579
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,990
smoothing things out. Okay for example
we talked about if you don't have the

580
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:44,000
we talked about if you don't have the
 

581
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,950
we talked about if you don't have the
ability to know which is your right edge

582
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
ability to know which is your right edge
 

583
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,190
ability to know which is your right edge
versus your left edge you can't detect

584
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
versus your left edge you can't detect
 

585
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,270
versus your left edge you can't detect
an edge in an image in a because you

586
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:53,280
an edge in an image in a because you
 

587
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,029
an edge in an image in a because you
can't tell. All you can do is average

588
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:55,039
can't tell. All you can do is average
 

589
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,510
can't tell. All you can do is average
and smooth things out.

590
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
and smooth things out.
 

591
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,669
and smooth things out.
So these are two uh sort of general

592
00:17:59,669 --> 00:17:59,679
So these are two uh sort of general
 

593
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,710
So these are two uh sort of general
challenges with the

594
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:02,720
challenges with the
 

595
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,190
challenges with the
the GNN.

596
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,200
the GNN.
 

597
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,909
the GNN.
>> Yes.

598
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
>> Yes.
 

599
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,150
>> Yes.
>> So

600
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
>> So
 

601
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,750
>> So
seems like sort of implicit in what you

602
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
seems like sort of implicit in what you
 

603
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:24,470
seems like sort of implicit in what you
just said there was enough.

604
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480

 

605
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,909

>> So that's a great question. The question

606
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
>> So that's a great question. The question
 

607
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,830
>> So that's a great question. The question
is I I kept saying because of small

608
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
is I I kept saying because of small
 

609
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,029
is I I kept saying because of small
embeddings and there's this challenge of

610
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
embeddings and there's this challenge of
 

611
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,630
embeddings and there's this challenge of
the idea that maybe you can solve this

612
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
the idea that maybe you can solve this
 

613
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,710
the idea that maybe you can solve this
by making the embeddings larger. In

614
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
by making the embeddings larger. In
 

615
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,549
by making the embeddings larger. In
fact, in graph neural nets, people do

616
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
fact, in graph neural nets, people do
 

617
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,230
fact, in graph neural nets, people do
try to make the embeddings larger.

618
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
try to make the embeddings larger.
 

619
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,990
try to make the embeddings larger.
Embeddings larger come with the standard

620
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
Embeddings larger come with the standard
 

621
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,990
Embeddings larger come with the standard
cost and constraint that one has in

622
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
cost and constraint that one has in
 

623
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,750
cost and constraint that one has in
neural nets is that you're adding a lot

624
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
neural nets is that you're adding a lot
 

625
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,510
neural nets is that you're adding a lot
of channels. Because you're adding

626
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
of channels. Because you're adding
 

627
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,789
of channels. Because you're adding
channels, you're then going to add lots

628
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
channels, you're then going to add lots
 

629
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,150
channels, you're then going to add lots
of parameters associated with those

630
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
of parameters associated with those
 

631
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,630
of parameters associated with those
channels. And sometimes what this can

632
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
channels. And sometimes what this can
 

633
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,950
channels. And sometimes what this can
result in is overfitting type problems

634
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
result in is overfitting type problems
 

635
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,710
result in is overfitting type problems
where your data you have too many

636
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,720
where your data you have too many
 

637
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,110
where your data you have too many
parameters too your embeddings are too

638
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
parameters too your embeddings are too
 

639
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,630
parameters too your embeddings are too
large and you end up not learning the

640
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
large and you end up not learning the
 

641
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,070
large and you end up not learning the
pattern you want and instead memorizing

642
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
pattern you want and instead memorizing
 

643
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,029
pattern you want and instead memorizing
your training data. Okay. So that that

644
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
your training data. Okay. So that that
 

645
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,789
your training data. Okay. So that that
concern remains although we've told you

646
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:08,799
concern remains although we've told you
 

647
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,070
concern remains although we've told you
there's lots of things about the way

648
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
there's lots of things about the way
 

649
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,669
there's lots of things about the way
that gradient descent works that

650
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
that gradient descent works that
 

651
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,150
that gradient descent works that
automatically tries to seems to mitigate

652
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,160
automatically tries to seems to mitigate
 

653
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,990
automatically tries to seems to mitigate
that a little bit more than you would

654
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
that a little bit more than you would
 

655
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,710
that a little bit more than you would
learned about in your standard uh ML

656
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720

657
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,549

659
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,190
class but it's still a concern. Uh there
is a very interesting area of thought of

660
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
is a very interesting area of thought of
 

661
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,150
is a very interesting area of thought of
how can you modulate the size of the

662
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,160
how can you modulate the size of the
 

663
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,390
how can you modulate the size of the
state with the size of the graph to try

664
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
state with the size of the graph to try
 

665
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,870
state with the size of the graph to try
to control this problem. This remains an

666
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
to control this problem. This remains an
 

667
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,630
to control this problem. This remains an
active area of research. How do you

668
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:36,640
active area of research. How do you
 

669
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,110
active area of research. How do you
combat the overs squashing problem and

670
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,120
combat the overs squashing problem and
 

671
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,190
combat the overs squashing problem and
how does that couple together? In fact,

672
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
how does that couple together? In fact,
 

673
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,950
how does that couple together? In fact,
remember we said before, we're going to

674
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
remember we said before, we're going to
 

675
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,630
remember we said before, we're going to
talk about transformers later, but one

676
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:44,640
talk about transformers later, but one
 

677
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,230
talk about transformers later, but one
way of thinking about transformers is

678
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
way of thinking about transformers is
 

679
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,909
way of thinking about transformers is
transformers are just graph neural nets

680
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
transformers are just graph neural nets
 

681
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,029
transformers are just graph neural nets
on a complete graph. So all these ideas

682
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
on a complete graph. So all these ideas
 

683
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,390
on a complete graph. So all these ideas
that we're talking about also have

684
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:52,400
that we're talking about also have
 

685
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,630
that we're talking about also have
counterparts in transformers because

686
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
counterparts in transformers because
 

687
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,750
counterparts in transformers because
transformers really are just graph

688
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
transformers really are just graph
 

689
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,669
transformers really are just graph
neural nets on a complete graph.

690
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679

 

691
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,590

Okay, so this is one idea. Yeah, go

692
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
Okay, so this is one idea. Yeah, go
 

693
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:11,830
Okay, so this is one idea. Yeah, go
ahead. Question.

694
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840

 

695
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,150

Ah, great. So, when we do pooling, we

696
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,160
Ah, great. So, when we do pooling, we
 

697
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,549
Ah, great. So, when we do pooling, we
downsample the image. And so, suddenly a

698
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
downsample the image. And so, suddenly a
 

699
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,630
downsample the image. And so, suddenly a
3x3 conveled

700
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640

 

701
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,070

has an effect as though it was actually

702
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
has an effect as though it was actually
 

703
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,390
has an effect as though it was actually
a 7 by7 con on the original image. Of

704
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:28,400
a 7 by7 con on the original image. Of
 

705
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,470
a 7 by7 con on the original image. Of
course, it's a very structured 7 by7 con

706
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
course, it's a very structured 7 by7 con
 

707
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,630
course, it's a very structured 7 by7 con
because it only can do one thing on the

708
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:32,640
because it only can do one thing on the
 

709
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,190
because it only can do one thing on the
neighbors, but it's it's like a bigger

710
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
neighbors, but it's it's like a bigger
 

711
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,549
neighbors, but it's it's like a bigger
con. So, does you understand that part?

712
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
con. So, does you understand that part?
 

713
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,909
con. So, does you understand that part?
Because you're you're working on the

714
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
Because you're you're working on the
 

715
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,590
Because you're you're working on the
image smaller. So, 3x3 is actually

716
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
image smaller. So, 3x3 is actually
 

717
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,870
image smaller. So, 3x3 is actually
reaches out further than the original

718
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
reaches out further than the original
 

719
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,390
reaches out further than the original
image.

720
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
image.
 

721
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,149
image.
So, that's what I meant by it grows the

722
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
So, that's what I meant by it grows the
 

723
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:53,909
So, that's what I meant by it grows the
receptive fields faster.

724
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919

 

725
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,549

So for GNN's you can grow the receptive

726
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:56,559
So for GNN's you can grow the receptive
 

727
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,390
So for GNN's you can grow the receptive
fields instantly to everything by adding

728
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
fields instantly to everything by adding
 

729
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,310
fields instantly to everything by adding
a global node and

730
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
a global node and
 

731
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,590
a global node and
but that doesn't give you the

732
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
but that doesn't give you the
 

733
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,470
but that doesn't give you the
intermediate thing. So a brief aside

734
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
intermediate thing. So a brief aside
 

735
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,630
intermediate thing. So a brief aside
before I continue on this is that this

736
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
before I continue on this is that this
 

737
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,149
before I continue on this is that this
idea of having global nodes turns out to

738
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
idea of having global nodes turns out to
 

739
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,789
idea of having global nodes turns out to
be so useful that even learned systems

740
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799
be so useful that even learned systems
 

741
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,990
be so useful that even learned systems
sometimes end up doing this. So we'll

742
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
sometimes end up doing this. So we'll
 

743
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,510
sometimes end up doing this. So we'll
talk about it later but uh in

744
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:25,520
talk about it later but uh in
 

745
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,510
talk about it later but uh in
transformer type networks sometimes

746
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
transformer type networks sometimes
 

747
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,110
transformer type networks sometimes
people have found that the models learn

748
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
people have found that the models learn
 

749
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,390
people have found that the models learn
like you don't they don't have any

750
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,400
like you don't they don't have any
 

751
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,430
like you don't they don't have any
global nodes but they learn to use other

752
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
global nodes but they learn to use other
 

753
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,789
global nodes but they learn to use other
things that are present in the training

754
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:36,799
things that are present in the training
 

755
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,909
things that are present in the training
data as though they were global nodes

756
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
data as though they were global nodes
 

757
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,470
data as though they were global nodes
for collecting information.

758
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
for collecting information.
 

759
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,470
for collecting information.
So sometimes transformer networks

760
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480
So sometimes transformer networks
 

761
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,789
So sometimes transformer networks
trained on text will use things like

762
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
trained on text will use things like
 

763
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,789
trained on text will use things like
start of not can't use start a sentence

764
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:48,799
start of not can't use start a sentence
 

765
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,310
start of not can't use start a sentence
because of certain other reasons but

766
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
because of certain other reasons but
 

767
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,470
because of certain other reasons but
they'll use like punctuation

768
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
they'll use like punctuation
 

769
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,590
they'll use like punctuation
and they'll say ah here's some

770
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600
and they'll say ah here's some
 

771
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,390
and they'll say ah here's some
punctuation great I can collect a bunch

772
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
punctuation great I can collect a bunch
 

773
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,029
punctuation great I can collect a bunch
of stuff here and then come back and

774
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
of stuff here and then come back and
 

775
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,350
of stuff here and then come back and
look at this information on this

776
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
look at this information on this
 

777
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,310
look at this information on this
collected global node and sometimes in

778
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,320
collected global node and sometimes in
 

779
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,310
collected global node and sometimes in
vision problems they'll find boring

780
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
vision problems they'll find boring
 

781
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,950
vision problems they'll find boring
scenes of images like plain sky and they

782
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
scenes of images like plain sky and they
 

783
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,710
scenes of images like plain sky and they
say oh good this is a good place to

784
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
say oh good this is a good place to
 

785
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,230
say oh good this is a good place to
stick uh a bunch of like scratch work uh

786
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240
stick uh a bunch of like scratch work uh
 

787
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,590
stick uh a bunch of like scratch work uh
you know like collect collect global

788
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
you know like collect collect global
 

789
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,190
you know like collect collect global
information into one place. So people in

790
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
information into one place. So people in
 

791
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,710
information into one place. So people in
when studying interpretation have found

792
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
when studying interpretation have found
 

793
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,390
when studying interpretation have found
these kind of behaviors from learn

794
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,400
these kind of behaviors from learn
 

795
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,710
these kind of behaviors from learn
systems in graph neural nets the idea of

796
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
systems in graph neural nets the idea of
 

797
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,270
systems in graph neural nets the idea of
adding uh fake global nodes is done

798
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,280
adding uh fake global nodes is done
 

799
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,270
adding uh fake global nodes is done
explicitly by adding explicit global

800
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
explicitly by adding explicit global
 

801
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,870
explicitly by adding explicit global
node.

802
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880
node.
 

803
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,350
node.
Okay, so now we find ourselves in the

804
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
Okay, so now we find ourselves in the
 

805
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,590
Okay, so now we find ourselves in the
situation that

806
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
situation that
 

807
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,750
situation that
okay, we can get information to

808
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
okay, we can get information to
 

809
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,149
okay, we can get information to
everybody, but is there a way of getting

810
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
everybody, but is there a way of getting
 

811
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,310
everybody, but is there a way of getting
information to kind of pull to something

812
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,320
information to kind of pull to something
 

813
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,190
information to kind of pull to something
natural to the topology of the graph?

814
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200
natural to the topology of the graph?
 

815
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,390
natural to the topology of the graph?
Okay, that's the problem. So you step

816
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
Okay, that's the problem. So you step
 

817
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,789
Okay, that's the problem. So you step
back and you say, what do we need to do?

818
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
back and you say, what do we need to do?
 

819
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,549
back and you say, what do we need to do?
We need to go from many nodes

820
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:00,559
We need to go from many nodes
 

821
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,789
We need to go from many nodes
to few nodes based on what? Based on

822
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:04,799
to few nodes based on what? Based on
 

823
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,310
to few nodes based on what? Based on
vector contents inside the nodes. That's

824
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
vector contents inside the nodes. That's
 

825
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,390
vector contents inside the nodes. That's
all you have generically. You have

826
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
all you have generically. You have
 

827
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,190
all you have generically. You have
connectivity information as well. Okay,

828
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
connectivity information as well. Okay,
 

829
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,270
connectivity information as well. Okay,
but you have to do it somehow based on

830
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
but you have to do it somehow based on
 

831
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,830
but you have to do it somehow based on
this uh uh vector contents.

832
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
this uh uh vector contents.
 

833
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,110
this uh uh vector contents.
So now

834
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
So now
 

835
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,830
So now
let's just think about it from

836
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:25,840
let's just think about it from
 

837
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,310
let's just think about it from
your machine learning class.

838
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
your machine learning class.
 

839
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,350
your machine learning class.
Have you seen any problem in your

840
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:31,360
Have you seen any problem in your
 

841
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,750
Have you seen any problem in your
regular machine learning class that seem

842
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:33,760
regular machine learning class that seem
 

843
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,190
regular machine learning class that seem
to be about going from many to few

844
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,200
to be about going from many to few
 

845
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,190
to be about going from many to few
where the

846
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,200
where the
 

847
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,149
where the
so in in multiclass classification

848
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
so in in multiclass classification
 

849
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,110
so in in multiclass classification
the few are already determined at the

850
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,120
the few are already determined at the
 

851
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,669
the few are already determined at the
beginning. There's cats, there's dogs

852
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:49,679
beginning. There's cats, there's dogs
 

853
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,669
beginning. There's cats, there's dogs
and so on. So this is not like that.

854
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679
and so on. So this is not like that.
 

855
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,549
and so on. So this is not like that.
This is I have many things. I want to

856
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:56,559
This is I have many things. I want to
 

857
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,149
This is I have many things. I want to
group them in some way so that things

858
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:00,159
group them in some way so that things
 

859
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,190
group them in some way so that things
are fewer.

860
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,200
are fewer.
 

861
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,830
are fewer.
Okay. So who's seen this? Shout it out.

862
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:07,840
Okay. So who's seen this? Shout it out.
 

863
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,470
Okay. So who's seen this? Shout it out.
>> Clustering. Yes.

864
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480

 

865
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:22,870

Okay. So this is like clustering.

866
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:22,880

 

867
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,310

which is an unsupervised learning

868
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,320
which is an unsupervised learning
 

869
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,470
which is an unsupervised learning
technique you learned.

870
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,480
technique you learned.
 

871
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,590
technique you learned.
So let's recall a classical

872
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
So let's recall a classical
 

873
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,390
So let's recall a classical
uh clustering approach Kines also called

874
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,400
uh clustering approach Kines also called
 

875
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,590
uh clustering approach Kines also called
Lloyd's algorithm for vector

876
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
Lloyd's algorithm for vector
 

877
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,269
Lloyd's algorithm for vector
quantization

878
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
quantization
 

879
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,950
quantization
which you've presumably everyone has

880
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
which you've presumably everyone has
 

881
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,149
which you've presumably everyone has
seen. How does it work?

882
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,159
seen. How does it work?
 

883
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,470
seen. How does it work?
It says you do this procedure.

884
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
It says you do this procedure.
 

885
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,990
It says you do this procedure.
You have a hyperparameter choice which

886
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
You have a hyperparameter choice which
 

887
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,909
You have a hyperparameter choice which
is how many clusters you want. Okay, K.

888
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
is how many clusters you want. Okay, K.
 

889
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,510
is how many clusters you want. Okay, K.
Then you start at random in some way.

890
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:51,520
Then you start at random in some way.
 

891
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,630
Then you start at random in some way.
There's different ways of doing this

892
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640
There's different ways of doing this
 

893
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,990
There's different ways of doing this
starting at random. And then you say for

894
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
starting at random. And then you say for
 

895
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,750
starting at random. And then you say for
each of the clusters that you've got

896
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:57,760
each of the clusters that you've got
 

897
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,310
each of the clusters that you've got
right now randomly initialized,

898
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:00,320
right now randomly initialized,
 

899
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,350
right now randomly initialized,
calculate centers for those clusters.

900
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,360
calculate centers for those clusters.
 

901
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,669
calculate centers for those clusters.
Then you take the points and you map

902
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
Then you take the points and you map
 

903
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,549
Then you take the points and you map
them to the center to get new clusters.

904
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559

 

905
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,510

Then you go to the calculating center

906
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
Then you go to the calculating center
 

907
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,029
Then you go to the calculating center
part and repeat. Everyone remember this?

908
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,039
part and repeat. Everyone remember this?
 

909
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,350
part and repeat. Everyone remember this?
Okay, great.

910
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
Okay, great.
 

911
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,750
Okay, great.
So we have a generic approach to doing

912
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
So we have a generic approach to doing
 

913
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,909
So we have a generic approach to doing
clustering from K means and other

914
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
clustering from K means and other
 

915
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,950
clustering from K means and other
related algorithms.

916
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:26,960
related algorithms.
 

917
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,510
related algorithms.
So now the question is if you want to do

918
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
So now the question is if you want to do
 

919
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,630
So now the question is if you want to do
this as a replacement for pooling,

920
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:34,640
this as a replacement for pooling,
 

921
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,310
this as a replacement for pooling,
you have to make sure that the step

922
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
you have to make sure that the step
 

923
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,669
you have to make sure that the step
you're doing is differentiable.

924
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:39,679
you're doing is differentiable.
 

925
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,590
you're doing is differentiable.
Does everyone see that? So it's kind of

926
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:41,600
Does everyone see that? So it's kind of
 

927
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,350
Does everyone see that? So it's kind of
it's a subtle thing because in

928
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,360
it's a subtle thing because in
 

929
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,909
it's a subtle thing because in
max pooling there's you have to make

930
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:47,919
max pooling there's you have to make
 

931
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,390
max pooling there's you have to make
sure gradients flow back through the

932
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
sure gradients flow back through the
 

933
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,990
sure gradients flow back through the
pooling operation for subsampling. The

934
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
pooling operation for subsampling. The
 

935
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,310
pooling operation for subsampling. The
gradients flow back through it. But you

936
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,320
gradients flow back through it. But you
 

937
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,310
gradients flow back through it. But you
also there's not really a concern that

938
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,320
also there's not really a concern that
 

939
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,750
also there's not really a concern that
the operation itself should be

940
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:57,760
the operation itself should be
 

941
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,549
the operation itself should be
differentiable in what it does.

942
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
differentiable in what it does.
 

943
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,510
differentiable in what it does.
It should route gradients through it.

944
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,520
It should route gradients through it.
 

945
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,230
It should route gradients through it.
But here presumably we don't know the

946
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
But here presumably we don't know the
 

947
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,549
But here presumably we don't know the
right way to do clustering for our

948
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:08,559
right way to do clustering for our
 

949
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,950
right way to do clustering for our
problem. If we knew for this particular

950
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
problem. If we knew for this particular
 

951
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,269
problem. If we knew for this particular
graph or this particular problem domain

952
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:13,279
graph or this particular problem domain
 

953
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,909
graph or this particular problem domain
in advance we can construct the right

954
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
in advance we can construct the right
 

955
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,630
in advance we can construct the right
down sampled clusters then of course we

956
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
down sampled clusters then of course we
 

957
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,870
down sampled clusters then of course we
can just do that insert that for our

958
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
can just do that insert that for our
 

959
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,789
can just do that insert that for our
graph specific problem. We want a more

960
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:22,799
graph specific problem. We want a more
 

961
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,710
graph specific problem. We want a more
generic approach. So we want to care

962
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:24,720
generic approach. So we want to care
 

963
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,950
generic approach. So we want to care
about the differentiability.

964
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960

 

965
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,990

So you ask the question is this

966
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
So you ask the question is this
 

967
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,750
So you ask the question is this
differentiable?

968
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760

 

969
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,310

So let's just think through this.

970
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,320

 

971
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,310

Starting at random we don't worry about

972
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
Starting at random we don't worry about
 

973
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,549
Starting at random we don't worry about
being differentiable

974
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
being differentiable
 

975
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,230
being differentiable
for k means this look at k means itself

976
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,240
for k means this look at k means itself
 

977
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,110
for k means this look at k means itself
calculating the centers

978
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,120
calculating the centers
 

979
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,990
calculating the centers
we that's fine that's a completely

980
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,000
we that's fine that's a completely
 

981
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,669
we that's fine that's a completely
differentiable operation to calculate

982
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:55,679
differentiable operation to calculate
 

983
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,590
differentiable operation to calculate
the centers

984
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
the centers
 

985
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,710
the centers
what about mapping points to centers

986
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,720
what about mapping points to centers
 

987
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,549
what about mapping points to centers
is that differentiable

988
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:06,559

 

989
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,390

does everyone see what we're trying to

990
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:08,400
does everyone see what we're trying to
 

991
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,230
does everyone see what we're trying to
We're asking the question if I the

992
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
We're asking the question if I the
 

993
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,070
We're asking the question if I the
output of this is a map that says for

994
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,080
output of this is a map that says for
 

995
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,110
output of this is a map that says for
every point which one it belongs to.

996
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
every point which one it belongs to.
 

997
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,630
every point which one it belongs to.
Okay, so you can think of that as a one

998
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:20,640
Okay, so you can think of that as a one
 

999
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,110
Okay, so you can think of that as a one
hot vector that has zeros in a bunch of

1000
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,120
hot vector that has zeros in a bunch of
 

1001
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,190
hot vector that has zeros in a bunch of
places and ones in some in one place and

1002
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
places and ones in some in one place and
 

1003
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,149
places and ones in some in one place and
zeros everywhere else is the operation

1004
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:30,159
zeros everywhere else is the operation
 

1005
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,630
zeros everywhere else is the operation
that goes from wherever the centers are,

1006
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
that goes from wherever the centers are,
 

1007
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,070
that goes from wherever the centers are,
whatever information is inside the

1008
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080
whatever information is inside the
 

1009
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,909
whatever information is inside the
vector to mapping points to the center

1010
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:37,919
vector to mapping points to the center
 

1011
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,669
vector to mapping points to the center
uh to specific centers. Is that

1012
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:39,679
uh to specific centers. Is that
 

1013
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,870
uh to specific centers. Is that
differentable?

1014
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880

 

1015
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,149

So let's take votes maybe. Yeah, sake of

1016
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:46,159
So let's take votes maybe. Yeah, sake of
 

1017
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,350
So let's take votes maybe. Yeah, sake of
vote. Who votes that yes, it's

1018
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
vote. Who votes that yes, it's
 

1019
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,470
vote. Who votes that yes, it's
differentable?

1020
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:50,480

 

1021
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,110

Okay, couple of votes. Who votes? No,

1022
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,120
Okay, couple of votes. Who votes? No,
 

1023
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,669
Okay, couple of votes. Who votes? No,
it's not differentiable.

1024
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
it's not differentiable.
 

1025
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,190
it's not differentiable.
Okay, so can I hear have a volunteer in

1026
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,200
Okay, so can I hear have a volunteer in
 

1027
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,590
Okay, so can I hear have a volunteer in
the not differentiable category to argue

1028
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:01,600
the not differentiable category to argue
 

1029
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,269
the not differentiable category to argue
why you think it's not differentable?

1030
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
why you think it's not differentable?
 

1031
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,789
why you think it's not differentable?
So, a lot of people raised their hands.

1032
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:06,799
So, a lot of people raised their hands.
 

1033
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,750
So, a lot of people raised their hands.
You know, you're not alone. Yeah.

1034
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:11,760

 

1035
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,830

>> Yes.

1036
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:13,840
>> Yes.
 

1037
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,269
>> Yes.
>> Does everyone see that? That's a very

1038
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
>> Does everyone see that? That's a very
 

1039
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,870
>> Does everyone see that? That's a very
good intuition. It's like it's like a

1040
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:16,880
good intuition. It's like it's like a
 

1041
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,789
good intuition. It's like it's like a
step function in some way in that the

1042
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:18,799
step function in some way in that the
 

1043
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,470
step function in some way in that the
only permissible outputs are all zeros

1044
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:20,480
only permissible outputs are all zeros
 

1045
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,430
only permissible outputs are all zeros
or ones. So how do you go softly?

1046
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,440
or ones. So how do you go softly?
 

1047
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,269
or ones. So how do you go softly?
Okay, a little bit of change will not

1048
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:27,279
Okay, a little bit of change will not
 

1049
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,269
Okay, a little bit of change will not
result either results in no change or a

1050
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:31,279
result either results in no change or a
 

1051
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,350
result either results in no change or a
dramatic change. So this can't have a

1052
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,360
dramatic change. So this can't have a
 

1053
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,549
dramatic change. So this can't have a
derivative. Very good intuition. Okay.

1054
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:36,559
derivative. Very good intuition. Okay.
 

1055
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,350
derivative. Very good intuition. Okay.
Yeah.

1056
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:39,360
Yeah.
 

1057
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,950
Yeah.
>> Ah great great question. So by itself

1058
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:42,960
>> Ah great great question. So by itself
 

1059
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,070
>> Ah great great question. So by itself
this is not differentiable. Okay. So,

1060
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,080
this is not differentiable. Okay. So,
 

1061
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,470
this is not differentiable. Okay. So,
but maybe we can use softmax ideas to

1062
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,480
but maybe we can use softmax ideas to
 

1063
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:57,110
but maybe we can use softmax ideas to
make it differentiable.

1064
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,120

 

1065
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,350

Okay. So, the barrier is this hard

1066
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,360
Okay. So, the barrier is this hard
 

1067
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,070
Okay. So, the barrier is this hard
assignments of points to clusters.

1068
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,080
assignments of points to clusters.
 

1069
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,310
assignments of points to clusters.
So, if we can get around this barrier,

1070
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,320
So, if we can get around this barrier,
 

1071
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,590
So, if we can get around this barrier,
we're good. Okay. So, can we use a

1072
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:07,600
we're good. Okay. So, can we use a
 

1073
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:26,630
we're good. Okay. So, can we use a
softmax?

1074
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:26,640

 

1075
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,510

Okay, so that's the idea. So now there's

1076
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:29,520
Okay, so that's the idea. So now there's
 

1077
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,789
Okay, so that's the idea. So now there's
a couple of different ways one could

1078
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:30,799
a couple of different ways one could
 

1079
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,070
a couple of different ways one could
proceed. One way is to say let's look at

1080
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,080
proceed. One way is to say let's look at
 

1081
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,669
proceed. One way is to say let's look at
clustering algorithms that you or

1082
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:35,679
clustering algorithms that you or
 

1083
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,070
clustering algorithms that you or
clustering like algorithms you've seen

1084
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
clustering like algorithms you've seen
 

1085
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,230
clustering like algorithms you've seen
that already have this softer assignment

1086
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,240
that already have this softer assignment
 

1087
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,029
that already have this softer assignment
property and see if we can adapt them.

1088
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:43,039
property and see if we can adapt them.
 

1089
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,750
property and see if we can adapt them.
So for example, if any of you have seen

1090
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:45,760
So for example, if any of you have seen
 

1091
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,470
So for example, if any of you have seen
uh Gaussian density estimation, right,

1092
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:48,480
uh Gaussian density estimation, right,
 

1093
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,430
uh Gaussian density estimation, right,
where you try to estimate some density

1094
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,440
where you try to estimate some density
 

1095
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,590
where you try to estimate some density
uh some distribution of points, an

1096
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:53,600
uh some distribution of points, an
 

1097
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,430
uh some distribution of points, an
empirical distribution of points and say

1098
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,440
empirical distribution of points and say
 

1099
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,190
empirical distribution of points and say
let me assume this was drawn from some

1100
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,200
let me assume this was drawn from some
 

1101
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,990
let me assume this was drawn from some
Gaussian density and the Gaussian

1102
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,000
Gaussian density and the Gaussian
 

1103
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,350
Gaussian density and the Gaussian
density was a mixture of K Gaussians

1104
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,360
density was a mixture of K Gaussians
 

1105
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,750
density was a mixture of K Gaussians
that usually those algorithms usually

1106
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
that usually those algorithms usually
 

1107
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,110
that usually those algorithms usually
involve EM and they involve soft

1108
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,120
involve EM and they involve soft
 

1109
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,909
involve EM and they involve soft
assignments of points to particular

1110
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:11,919
assignments of points to particular
 

1111
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,510
assignments of points to particular
Gaussians.

1112
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:13,520
Gaussians.
 

1113
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,590
Gaussians.
So you could do we could go down that

1114
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
So you could do we could go down that
 

1115
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,750
So you could do we could go down that
that that path. We're not going to but

1116
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,760
that that path. We're not going to but
 

1117
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,590
that that path. We're not going to but
that's a totally valid thing to study

1118
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,600
that's a totally valid thing to study
 

1119
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,990
that's a totally valid thing to study
and people study uh clustering

1120
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
and people study uh clustering
 

1121
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,830
and people study uh clustering
algorithms like that in the context of

1122
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:23,840
algorithms like that in the context of
 

1123
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,990
algorithms like that in the context of
graphs.

1124
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,000
graphs.
 

1125
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,510
graphs.
Instead

1126
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:27,520
Instead
 

1127
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,789
Instead
we're going to follow an idea that's

1128
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:28,799
we're going to follow an idea that's
 

1129
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,870
we're going to follow an idea that's
called diff pool.

1130
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:30,880
called diff pool.
 

1131
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,630
called diff pool.
Okay,

1132
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:32,640
Okay,
 

1133
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,029
Okay,
which is if you want to you can look at

1134
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:35,039
which is if you want to you can look at
 

1135
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,070
which is if you want to you can look at
the documentation in PyTorch Geometric

1136
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,080
the documentation in PyTorch Geometric
 

1137
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,070
the documentation in PyTorch Geometric
and the paper itself is called

1138
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
and the paper itself is called
 

1139
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,990
and the paper itself is called
hierarchical graph representation

1140
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,000
hierarchical graph representation
 

1141
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,990
hierarchical graph representation
learning with differentiable pooling.

1142
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,000
learning with differentiable pooling.
 

1143
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,110
learning with differentiable pooling.
Okay, if you want to read the paper.

1144
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,120

 

1145
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,310

Um, and it's going to say when we down

1146
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
Um, and it's going to say when we down
 

1147
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,389
Um, and it's going to say when we down
sample a graph

1148
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:54,399
sample a graph
 

1149
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,029
sample a graph
because we're going to have to do this

1150
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:57,039
because we're going to have to do this
 

1151
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,909
because we're going to have to do this
soft assignment,

1152
00:30:59,909 --> 00:30:59,919
soft assignment,
 

1153
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,310
soft assignment,
every point,

1154
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,320
every point,
 

1155
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,630
every point,
every node is going to belong to

1156
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:04,640
every node is going to belong to
 

1157
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,029
every node is going to belong to
everything. Does everyone see that? If I

1158
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:07,039
everything. Does everyone see that? If I
 

1159
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,470
everything. Does everyone see that? If I
if I soft assignment, then nothing will

1160
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:08,480
if I soft assignment, then nothing will
 

1161
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,549
if I soft assignment, then nothing will
be pure.

1162
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559
be pure.
 

1163
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,950
be pure.
So every point will belong to every

1164
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
So every point will belong to every
 

1165
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,789
So every point will belong to every
cluster a little bit and as a result

1166
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:16,799
cluster a little bit and as a result
 

1167
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,870
cluster a little bit and as a result
every cluster will be connected to every

1168
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:18,880
every cluster will be connected to every
 

1169
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,990
every cluster will be connected to every
other cluster a little bit because there

1170
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,000
other cluster a little bit because there
 

1171
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,269
other cluster a little bit because there
were edges presumably in the original

1172
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:23,279
were edges presumably in the original
 

1173
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,710
were edges presumably in the original
graph. If the graph had no edges it's a

1174
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:24,720
graph. If the graph had no edges it's a
 

1175
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,990
graph. If the graph had no edges it's a
boring problem. Okay everyone see that?

1176
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,000
boring problem. Okay everyone see that?
 

1177
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,830
boring problem. Okay everyone see that?
So we're when we do the downsampling in

1178
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:29,840
So we're when we do the downsampling in
 

1179
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,909
So we're when we do the downsampling in
diff we're going to get a smaller graph

1180
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:31,919
diff we're going to get a smaller graph
 

1181
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,430
diff we're going to get a smaller graph
but it's going to be fully connected and

1182
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
but it's going to be fully connected and
 

1183
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,789
but it's going to be fully connected and
there going to be probabilities on the

1184
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:34,799
there going to be probabilities on the
 

1185
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,310
there going to be probabilities on the
edges some kind of weights on the edges.

1186
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,320

 

1187
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,230

Okay

1188
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240
Okay
 

1189
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,430
Okay
so

1190
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,440

 

1191
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,830

the idea is again following the softmax

1192
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:49,840
the idea is again following the softmax
 

1193
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,350
the idea is again following the softmax
idea we're going to make every point

1194
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,360
idea we're going to make every point
 

1195
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,509
idea we're going to make every point
belong to every cluster just with some

1196
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:53,519
belong to every cluster just with some
 

1197
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,350
belong to every cluster just with some
probability.

1198
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,360
probability.
 

1199
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,950
probability.
Okay, does everyone see the objective

1200
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
Okay, does everyone see the objective
 

1201
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,029
Okay, does everyone see the objective
we're trying to do? We're trying to make

1202
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,039
we're trying to do? We're trying to make
 

1203
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,190
we're trying to do? We're trying to make
a differentiable pooling operation

1204
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
a differentiable pooling operation
 

1205
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,230
a differentiable pooling operation
because this hard assignment is a

1206
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:04,240
because this hard assignment is a
 

1207
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,750
because this hard assignment is a
barrier to differentiability. We're

1208
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:05,760
barrier to differentiability. We're
 

1209
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,669
barrier to differentiability. We're
going to have to do something soft. Once

1210
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679
going to have to do something soft. Once
 

1211
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,350
going to have to do something soft. Once
we're going to do something soft, we're

1212
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,360
we're going to do something soft, we're
 

1213
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,990
we're going to do something soft, we're
going to end up with things being fully

1214
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,000
going to end up with things being fully
 

1215
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,389
going to end up with things being fully
connected. We just live with that. So,

1216
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
connected. We just live with that. So,
 

1217
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,350
connected. We just live with that. So,
we do a we go down, we'll have things

1218
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360
we do a we go down, we'll have things
 

1219
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,710
we do a we go down, we'll have things
fully connected, but with some

1220
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
fully connected, but with some
 

1221
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,789
fully connected, but with some
probabilities.

1222
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:22,799

 

1223
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,389

Okay. So this problem is has fall this

1224
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:28,399
Okay. So this problem is has fall this
 

1225
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,750
Okay. So this problem is has fall this
this this this is a really interesting

1226
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:31,760
this this this is a really interesting
 

1227
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,630
this this this is a really interesting
algorithm to study because it ex it

1228
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
algorithm to study because it ex it
 

1229
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,630
algorithm to study because it ex it
shows us some design principles that's

1230
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
shows us some design principles that's
 

1231
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,990
shows us some design principles that's
why I'm want to cover it.

1232
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,000
why I'm want to cover it.
 

1233
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,549
why I'm want to cover it.
So the idea is we want to do this.

1234
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:44,559
So the idea is we want to do this.
 

1235
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,389
So the idea is we want to do this.
Okay, we want to do this. However, we

1236
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:48,399
Okay, we want to do this. However, we
 

1237
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,830
Okay, we want to do this. However, we
don't know how to do this,

1238
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:51,840
don't know how to do this,
 

1239
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,750
don't know how to do this,
right? We want to do this. We don't know

1240
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:53,760
right? We want to do this. We don't know
 

1241
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,669
right? We want to do this. We don't know
how to do this. We don't know the right

1242
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:55,679
how to do this. We don't know the right
 

1243
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,190
how to do this. We don't know the right
way to do this for the kind of graphs

1244
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
way to do this for the kind of graphs
 

1245
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,430
way to do this for the kind of graphs
for our application.

1246
00:32:59,430 --> 00:32:59,440
for our application.
 

1247
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,230
for our application.
Everyone see that? So now what was the

1248
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
Everyone see that? So now what was the
 

1249
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,590
Everyone see that? So now what was the
meta trick that we talked about in this

1250
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:07,600
meta trick that we talked about in this
 

1251
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,509
meta trick that we talked about in this
class for what do you do in deep

1252
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
class for what do you do in deep
 

1253
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,990
class for what do you do in deep
learning when you don't know how to do

1254
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
learning when you don't know how to do
 

1255
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,750
learning when you don't know how to do
something?

1256
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:15,760

 

1257
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,310

>> Make it learnable. Okay. So we're going

1258
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:18,320
>> Make it learnable. Okay. So we're going
 

1259
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,190
>> Make it learnable. Okay. So we're going
to say I don't know how to do this. I

1260
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
to say I don't know how to do this. I
 

1261
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,350
to say I don't know how to do this. I
will make it learnable.

1262
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
will make it learnable.
 

1263
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,149
will make it learnable.
Okay. So how do we make it learnable?

1264
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:26,159
Okay. So how do we make it learnable?
 

1265
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,710
Okay. So how do we make it learnable?
We're going to gray box the problem.

1266
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:28,720
We're going to gray box the problem.
 

1267
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,310
We're going to gray box the problem.
Right? there's a problem which is

1268
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:30,320
Right? there's a problem which is
 

1269
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,710
Right? there's a problem which is
figuring out how to do the downsampling.

1270
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
figuring out how to do the downsampling.
 

1271
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,990
figuring out how to do the downsampling.
We're going to say, okay, this is going

1272
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,000
We're going to say, okay, this is going
 

1273
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,950
We're going to say, okay, this is going
to be a box. How to do the downsampling?

1274
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:36,960
to be a box. How to do the downsampling?
 

1275
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,389
to be a box. How to do the downsampling?
I'll call it a gray box because we're

1276
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:38,399
I'll call it a gray box because we're
 

1277
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,669
I'll call it a gray box because we're
going to look inside it a little bit,

1278
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:39,679
going to look inside it a little bit,
 

1279
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,029
going to look inside it a little bit,
but we're going to be kind of treat it

1280
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
but we're going to be kind of treat it
 

1281
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,350
but we're going to be kind of treat it
like something that should be learnable.

1282
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:43,360
like something that should be learnable.
 

1283
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,990
like something that should be learnable.
So, we have to understand what are its

1284
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000
So, we have to understand what are its
 

1285
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,310
So, we have to understand what are its
inputs and what are its outputs. So,

1286
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,320
inputs and what are its outputs. So,
 

1287
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,990
inputs and what are its outputs. So,
think of a specific module like think

1288
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,000
think of a specific module like think
 

1289
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,029
think of a specific module like think
about CNN, you have a downsampling

1290
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:53,039
about CNN, you have a downsampling
 

1291
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,070
about CNN, you have a downsampling
layer, okay, pooling, we're talking

1292
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,080
layer, okay, pooling, we're talking
 

1293
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,509
layer, okay, pooling, we're talking
about that. What does this look like?

1294
00:33:59,509 --> 00:33:59,519
about that. What does this look like?
 

1295
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,830
about that. What does this look like?
Well, it's going to have to have inputs

1296
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
Well, it's going to have to have inputs
 

1297
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,470
Well, it's going to have to have inputs
which are the graph with some embedding

1298
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,480
which are the graph with some embedding
 

1299
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,029
which are the graph with some embedding
vectors inside every node.

1300
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:07,039
vectors inside every node.
 

1301
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,310
vectors inside every node.
Okay, that's what it has to start with.

1302
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:10,320
Okay, that's what it has to start with.
 

1303
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,230
Okay, that's what it has to start with.
And its outputs has to be a klength

1304
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,240
And its outputs has to be a klength
 

1305
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,109
And its outputs has to be a klength
vector for every node with probabilities

1306
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:17,119
vector for every node with probabilities
 

1307
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,190
vector for every node with probabilities
in it.

1308
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
in it.
 

1309
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,349
in it.
Like for this particular node, which of

1310
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:21,359
Like for this particular node, which of
 

1311
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,669
Like for this particular node, which of
the k different clusters does it belong

1312
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:23,679
the k different clusters does it belong
 

1313
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,669
the k different clusters does it belong
to? which is not going to be a hard

1314
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:25,679
to? which is not going to be a hard
 

1315
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,589
to? which is not going to be a hard
decision, but it's going to be will I

1316
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:27,599
decision, but it's going to be will I
 

1317
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,230
decision, but it's going to be will I
belong 90% to this, 10% to this, or 9%

1318
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:32,240
belong 90% to this, 10% to this, or 9%
 

1319
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,750
belong 90% to this, 10% to this, or 9%
of this, and tiny amounts to everything

1320
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:33,760
of this, and tiny amounts to everything
 

1321
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,430
of this, and tiny amounts to everything
else.

1322
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:35,440
else.
 

1323
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,069
else.
Okay,

1324
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:38,079
Okay,
 

1325
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,669
Okay,
does everyone see the input output we

1326
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:39,679
does everyone see the input output we
 

1327
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,629
does everyone see the input output we
need from this gray box? If we choose to

1328
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:42,639
need from this gray box? If we choose to
 

1329
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,750
need from this gray box? If we choose to
decide that we're going to do something

1330
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:43,760
decide that we're going to do something
 

1331
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,230
decide that we're going to do something
like clustering in a differentiable way,

1332
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,240
like clustering in a differentiable way,
 

1333
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,389
like clustering in a differentiable way,
we want something like this.

1334
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,399

 

1335
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,990

Okay,

1336
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000
Okay,
 

1337
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,349
Okay,
questions?

1338
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:55,359

 

1339
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,390

So we'll give it a name.

1340
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,400
So we'll give it a name.
 

1341
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,510
So we'll give it a name.
For node I we'll have an SI which I'll

1342
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,520
For node I we'll have an SI which I'll
 

1343
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,630
For node I we'll have an SI which I'll
think of as a row because it's

1344
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
think of as a row because it's
 

1345
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,589
think of as a row because it's
probabilities P1 through PK.

1346
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:07,599

 

1347
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,270

Okay.

1348
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,280
Okay.
 

1349
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,190
Okay.
So I need some differentiable operation

1350
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,200
So I need some differentiable operation
 

1351
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,190
So I need some differentiable operation
that does this

1352
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,200
that does this
 

1353
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,670
that does this
that goes from a graph with embeddings

1354
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,680
that goes from a graph with embeddings
 

1355
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,109
that goes from a graph with embeddings
to vectors like this.

1356
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:19,119
to vectors like this.
 

1357
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,630
to vectors like this.
Does everyone see that? Okay.

1358
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:22,640
Does everyone see that? Okay.
 

1359
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,790
Does everyone see that? Okay.
Now

1360
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:26,800

 

1361
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,990

the key thing is to say

1362
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
the key thing is to say
 

1363
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,510
the key thing is to say
what are my ingredients that I'm going

1364
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:31,520
what are my ingredients that I'm going
 

1365
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,670
what are my ingredients that I'm going
to use.

1366
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:33,680
to use.
 

1367
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,510
to use.
I know how to get to probabilities. I

1368
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,520
I know how to get to probabilities. I
 

1369
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,550
I know how to get to probabilities. I
have a standard way to get to

1370
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:36,560
have a standard way to get to
 

1371
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,630
have a standard way to get to
probabilities which I compute linear

1372
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
probabilities which I compute linear
 

1373
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,910
probabilities which I compute linear
scores of some kind and I softmax them.

1374
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:43,920

 

1375
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,230

Okay. So I'm building this gray what

1376
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,240
Okay. So I'm building this gray what
 

1377
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,670
Okay. So I'm building this gray what
what I put inside this gray box. So

1378
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
what I put inside this gray box. So
 

1379
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,910
what I put inside this gray box. So
it'll end with some kind of scores that

1380
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:49,920
it'll end with some kind of scores that
 

1381
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,030
it'll end with some kind of scores that
go through a softmax that give me this.

1382
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,040

 

1383
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,829

Okay.

1384
00:35:59,829 --> 00:35:59,839
Okay.
 

1385
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,670
Okay.
So now what do I know? I have a graph.

1386
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:03,680
So now what do I know? I have a graph.
 

1387
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,230
So now what do I know? I have a graph.
That's my input. It has embeddings in

1388
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,240
That's my input. It has embeddings in
 

1389
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,910
That's my input. It has embeddings in
it.

1390
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:07,920
it.
 

1391
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,030
it.
I will want to have k scores for every

1392
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040
I will want to have k scores for every
 

1393
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,430
I will want to have k scores for every
node

1394
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,440
node
 

1395
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,550
node
that I'm going to then run through a

1396
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:14,560
that I'm going to then run through a
 

1397
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,109
that I'm going to then run through a
softmax.

1398
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:17,119
softmax.
 

1399
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,030
softmax.
So

1400
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,040
So
 

1401
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,270
So
stepping back, this looks like what kind

1402
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,280
stepping back, this looks like what kind
 

1403
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,470
stepping back, this looks like what kind
of a problem? This looks like a node

1404
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:24,480
of a problem? This looks like a node
 

1405
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,109
of a problem? This looks like a node
level classification problem on a graph.

1406
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:29,119
level classification problem on a graph.
 

1407
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,430
level classification problem on a graph.
Everyone see that

1408
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:31,440
Everyone see that
 

1409
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,270
Everyone see that

In between I want to do pooling. Looking

1422
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:48,560
In between I want to do pooling. Looking
 

1423
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,150
In between I want to do pooling. Looking
at this in between problem, I have a

So I ask myself, how do I do problems on

1432
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:00,880
So I ask myself, how do I do problems on
 

1433
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,230
So I ask myself, how do I do problems on
graphs?

1434
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,240

 

1435
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,630

Given a graph, I need a different set of

Given a graph, I need a different set of
 

1437
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,589
Given a graph, I need a different set of
steps to give me scores. But I go, oh, I

1438
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:09,599
steps to give me scores. But I go, oh, I
 

1439
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,750
steps to give me scores. But I go, oh, I
know how to do this. I have to make it

1440
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:11,760
know how to do this. I have to make it
 

1441
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,069
know how to do this. I have to make it
learnable. So what's a generic way to

1442
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:14,079
learnable. So what's a generic way to
 

1443
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,710
learnable. So what's a generic way to
have a learnable algorithm on a graph?

00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:16,720
have a learnable algorithm on a graph?
 

1445
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,670
have a learnable algorithm on a graph?
Anyone?

1446
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:21,680

 

1447
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,870

What are we talking about right now?

1448
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
What are we talking about right now?
 

1449
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,870
What are we talking about right now?
We're talking about graph neural nets.

1450
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
We're talking about graph neural nets.
 

1451
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,470
We're talking about graph neural nets.
If you want an alertable algorithm on a

1452
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,480
If you want an alertable algorithm on a
 

1453
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,870
If you want an alertable algorithm on a
graph, you make a graph neural net. So

1454
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:30,880
graph, you make a graph neural net. So
 

1455
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,030
graph, you make a graph neural net. So
we reduced the problem of doing the

1456
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,040
we reduced the problem of doing the
 

1457
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,390
we reduced the problem of doing the
pooling part to saying I want a graph

1458
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:38,400
pooling part to saying I want a graph
 

1459
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,430
pooling part to saying I want a graph
neural net.

1460
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:41,440
neural net.
 

1461
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,510
neural net.
So inside my big graph neural net, I'll

1462
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
So inside my big graph neural net, I'll
 

1463
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,990
So inside my big graph neural net, I'll
have a little graph neural net whose job

1464
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,000
have a little graph neural net whose job
 

1465
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,630
have a little graph neural net whose job
is to do pooling.

1466
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:48,640
is to do pooling.
 

1467
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:59,750
is to do pooling.
Okay, questions.

1468
00:37:59,750 --> 00:37:59,760

 

1469
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,950

He said like look when we have the graph

1470
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:02,960
He said like look when we have the graph
 

1471
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,750
He said like look when we have the graph
we have the connectivity of the graph is

1472
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:05,760
we have the connectivity of the graph is
 

1473
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,349
we have the connectivity of the graph is
used to pass messages the information is

1474
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:09,359
used to pass messages the information is
 

1475
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,670
used to pass messages the information is
inside the embeddings but presumably to

1476
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:11,680
inside the embeddings but presumably to
 

1477
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,190
inside the embeddings but presumably to
do the clustering the positions meaning

1478
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,200
do the clustering the positions meaning
 

1479
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,349
do the clustering the positions meaning
the connectivity matters if you want to

1480
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:17,359
the connectivity matters if you want to
 

1481
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,150
the connectivity matters if you want to
do clustering well how do we know that

1482
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
do clustering well how do we know that
 

1483
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,870
do clustering well how do we know that
the information we need to do the

1484
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:22,880
the information we need to do the
 

1485
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,790
the information we need to do the
clustering is actually present inside

1486
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800
clustering is actually present inside
 

1487
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,310
clustering is actually present inside
the embeddings everyone get that really

1488
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,320
the embeddings everyone get that really
 

1489
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,150
the embeddings everyone get that really
good question. We're going to end up

1490
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,160
good question. We're going to end up
 

1491
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,950
good question. We're going to end up
solving this problem in two ways. Um,

1492
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:32,960
solving this problem in two ways. Um,
 

1493
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,950
solving this problem in two ways. Um,
what we're going to do is we're going to

1494
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:34,960
what we're going to do is we're going to
 

1495
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,390
what we're going to do is we're going to
a hope the information exists.

1496
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,400
a hope the information exists.
 

1497
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,670
a hope the information exists.
Okay? And B, we're going to set up some

1498
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:41,680
Okay? And B, we're going to set up some
 

1499
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,069
Okay? And B, we're going to set up some
auxiliary losses during training that

1500
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:44,079
auxiliary losses during training that
 

1501
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,310
auxiliary losses during training that
will encourage the network to make sure

1502
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,320
will encourage the network to make sure
 

1503
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,550
will encourage the network to make sure
that information exists.

1504
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:48,560
that information exists.
 

1505
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,430
that information exists.
Two different things. Okay. But the hope

1506
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,440
Two different things. Okay. But the hope
 

1507
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,670
Two different things. Okay. But the hope
is very important in terms of how we do

1508
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:53,680
is very important in terms of how we do
 

1509
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,109
is very important in terms of how we do
it. We're not going to engineer the

1510
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:55,119
it. We're not going to engineer the
 

1511
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,550
it. We're not going to engineer the
information into the graph embedding.

1512
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:58,560
information into the graph embedding.
 

1513
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,470
information into the graph embedding.
There are ways to do that to try to

1514
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,480
There are ways to do that to try to
 

1515
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,069
There are ways to do that to try to
engineer the information into the

1516
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:02,079
engineer the information into the
 

1517
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,349
engineer the information into the
embedding. Um we'll talk more about that

1518
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:05,359
embedding. Um we'll talk more about that
 

1519
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,950
embedding. Um we'll talk more about that
when we talk about transformers. But

1520
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:06,960
when we talk about transformers. But
 

1521
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,390
when we talk about transformers. But
here we're going to use this hope and

1522
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,400
here we're going to use this hope and
 

1523
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,349
here we're going to use this hope and
then uh encourage method.

1524
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:13,359
then uh encourage method.
 

1525
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,790
then uh encourage method.
Okay. So the answer is

1526
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:18,800

 

1527
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,790

use a GNN.

1528
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:22,800

 

1529
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,270

Okay.

1530
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,280
Okay.
 

1531
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,230
Okay.
So now what we're going to do is we're

1532
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:28,240
So now what we're going to do is we're
 

1533
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,030
So now what we're going to do is we're
gonna make this a design choice. Come up

1534
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,040
gonna make this a design choice. Come up
 

1535
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,630
gonna make this a design choice. Come up
with a GNN. So what's what does it mean

1536
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:32,640
with a GNN. So what's what does it mean
 

1537
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,310
with a GNN. So what's what does it mean
to come with a GNN? It means come up

1538
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
to come with a GNN? It means come up
 

1539
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,310
to come with a GNN? It means come up
with some kind of information

1540
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:36,320
with some kind of information
 

1541
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,470
with some kind of information
aggregation algorithm with learnable

1542
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:38,480
aggregation algorithm with learnable
 

1543
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,750
aggregation algorithm with learnable
weights have some number of layers pass

1544
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:41,760
weights have some number of layers pass
 

1545
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,150
weights have some number of layers pass
messages and do that. We're going to let

1546
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,160
messages and do that. We're going to let
 

1547
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,710
messages and do that. We're going to let
that be a black a box right now a design

1548
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:46,720
that be a black a box right now a design
 

1549
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,390
that be a black a box right now a design
choice

1550
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,400
choice
 

1551
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,349
choice
like how you do it. So practical answer

1552
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
like how you do it. So practical answer
 

1553
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,910
like how you do it. So practical answer
go look at other people did copy their

1554
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:53,920
go look at other people did copy their
 

1555
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,030
go look at other people did copy their
poolings and use them right but they're

1556
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,040
poolings and use them right but they're
 

1557
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,310
poolings and use them right but they're
going to be learnable parameters inside

1558
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:58,320
going to be learnable parameters inside
 

1559
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,430
going to be learnable parameters inside
this GNN

1560
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:01,440
this GNN
 

1561
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,390
this GNN
and the end of that GNN will be a linear

1562
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:04,400
and the end of that GNN will be a linear
 

1563
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,630
and the end of that GNN will be a linear
thing that generates scores based on the

1564
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:06,640
thing that generates scores based on the
 

1565
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,710
thing that generates scores based on the
embeddings followed by a softmax to

1566
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:08,720
embeddings followed by a softmax to
 

1567
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,270
embeddings followed by a softmax to
generate the probabilities we want

1568
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:13,280

 

1569
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:21,589

then we'll drop that in. Yeah.

1570
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:21,599

 

1571
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,390

Yes.

1572
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400

 

1573
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,910

>> Excellent. So that now comes the

1574
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:27,920
>> Excellent. So that now comes the
 

1575
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,349
>> Excellent. So that now comes the
question, how do I actually use this

1576
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:29,359
question, how do I actually use this
 

1577
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,630
question, how do I actually use this
information? So I'll talk about that

1578
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:30,640
information? So I'll talk about that
 

1579
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,870
information? So I'll talk about that
next. Like how do I how do I given that

1580
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
next. Like how do I how do I given that
 

1581
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,390
next. Like how do I how do I given that
I have probabilities? How do I get

1582
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
I have probabilities? How do I get
 

1583
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,829
I have probabilities? How do I get
information into a node?

1584
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:37,839
information into a node?
 

1585
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,589
information into a node?
Okay, so that's what we'll do next.

1586
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
Okay, so that's what we'll do next.
 

1587
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,670
Okay, so that's what we'll do next.
So we have these soft assignments into

1588
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
So we have these soft assignments into
 

1589
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,589
So we have these soft assignments into
clusters,

1590
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:45,599
clusters,
 

1591
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,430
clusters,
right? We need new vector embeddings for

1592
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,440
right? We need new vector embeddings for
 

1593
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,950
right? We need new vector embeddings for
the S for the clusters, whatever the

1594
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:50,960
the S for the clusters, whatever the
 

1595
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,670
the S for the clusters, whatever the
clusters are. I think I used K here. So,

1596
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:53,680
clusters are. I think I used K here. So,
 

1597
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:03,190
clusters are. I think I used K here. So,
let me fix this.

1598
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,200

 

1599
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,990

So, the answer is pretty

1600
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:06,000
So, the answer is pretty
 

1601
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,750
So, the answer is pretty
straightforward.

1602
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:07,760
straightforward.
 

1603
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,510
straightforward.
The natural choice is if I have

1604
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:09,520
The natural choice is if I have
 

1605
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,910
The natural choice is if I have
probability of membership.

1606
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
probability of membership.
 

1607
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,069
probability of membership.
So every node has a probability of of

1608
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:14,079
So every node has a probability of of
 

1609
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,790
So every node has a probability of of
being in different uh clusters. It can

1610
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:16,800
being in different uh clusters. It can
 

1611
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,870
being in different uh clusters. It can
just take its embedding and split it ac

1612
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:18,880
just take its embedding and split it ac
 

1613
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,230
just take its embedding and split it ac
across the probabilities into the

1614
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,240
across the probabilities into the
 

1615
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,710
across the probabilities into the
different clusters and sum things up.

1616
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:22,720
different clusters and sum things up.
 

1617
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,790
different clusters and sum things up.
Everyone see the natural choice. You

1618
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:24,800
Everyone see the natural choice. You
 

1619
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,910
Everyone see the natural choice. You
think of it as like you take the

1620
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920
think of it as like you take the
 

1621
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,829
think of it as like you take the
embedding and you pour it into the

1622
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:27,839
embedding and you pour it into the
 

1623
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,990
embedding and you pour it into the
different clusters you belong to

1624
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,000
different clusters you belong to
 

1625
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,750
different clusters you belong to
according to your probabilities.

1626
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:33,760

 

1627
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,589

So the hidden for J is ranging from one

1628
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:39,599
So the hidden for J is ranging from one
 

1629
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,670
So the hidden for J is ranging from one
to K over the clusters at the next layer

1630
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
to K over the clusters at the next layer
 

1631
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,870
to K over the clusters at the next layer
layer plus one is whatever it was before

1632
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:46,880
layer plus one is whatever it was before
 

1633
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,670
layer plus one is whatever it was before
at the previous layer times the

1634
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:49,680
at the previous layer times the
 

1635
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,069
at the previous layer times the
probability that node I belongs to

1636
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:54,079
probability that node I belongs to
 

1637
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,069
probability that node I belongs to
cluster J

1638
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,079
cluster J
 

1639
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:05,829
cluster J
from the softmax.

1640
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:05,839

 

1641
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,550

Okay, so this is the

1642
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
Okay, so this is the
 

1643
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,910
Okay, so this is the
formula you'd use.

1644
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:11,920
formula you'd use.
 

1645
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,550
formula you'd use.
So now all of the embedding information

1646
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:14,560
So now all of the embedding information
 

1647
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,790
So now all of the embedding information
that was in the original graph has been

1648
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800
that was in the original graph has been
 

1649
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,670
that was in the original graph has been
poured into these K clusters.

1650
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:21,680

 

1651
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,270

So I have new embeddings for this K

1652
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:23,280
So I have new embeddings for this K
 

1653
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,510
So I have new embeddings for this K
cluster, these K clusters.

1654
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:25,520
cluster, these K clusters.
 

1655
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,710
cluster, these K clusters.
Any

1656
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:28,720

 

1657
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,390

questions on this? It's like a natural

1658
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:30,400
questions on this? It's like a natural
 

1659
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,309
questions on this? It's like a natural
choice to do. Clearly nicely

1660
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:32,319
choice to do. Clearly nicely
 

1661
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,510
choice to do. Clearly nicely
differentiable

1662
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:35,520

 

1663
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,069

as an operation. Just you're keeping

1664
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:38,079
as an operation. Just you're keeping
 

1665
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,150
as an operation. Just you're keeping
track of operations. As an operation,

1666
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:40,160
track of operations. As an operation,
 

1667
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,030
track of operations. As an operation,
this is a mild nonlinearity. It's a

1668
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,040
this is a mild nonlinearity. It's a
 

1669
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,069
this is a mild nonlinearity. It's a
product,

1670
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:46,079

 

1671
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,990

right? So, it's going to send a gradient

1672
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,000
right? So, it's going to send a gradient
 

1673
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,510
right? So, it's going to send a gradient
back to this and to this

1674
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:55,520

 

1675
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,430

Next thing you'll notice, let me see. I

1676
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:57,440
Next thing you'll notice, let me see. I
 

1677
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,710
Next thing you'll notice, let me see. I
don't know if I

1678
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:00,720
don't know if I
 

1679
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,150
don't know if I
Yeah.

1680
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,160

 

1681
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,270

Notice that as a operation, remember the

1682
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,280
Notice that as a operation, remember the
 

1683
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,950
Notice that as a operation, remember the
entire gray box has this behavior.

1684
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:12,960
entire gray box has this behavior.
 

1685
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,829
entire gray box has this behavior.
So this gray box when it has gradients

1686
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
So this gray box when it has gradients
 

1687
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,270
So this gray box when it has gradients
on this, those gradients will go back to

1688
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:19,280
on this, those gradients will go back to
 

1689
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,309
on this, those gradients will go back to
the node.

1690
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:22,319
the node.
 

1691
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,550
the node.
Right? Did you see that? According to

1692
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:24,560
Right? Did you see that? According to
 

1693
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,470
Right? Did you see that? According to
this probabilities,

1694
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:26,480
this probabilities,
 

1695
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,030
this probabilities,
so it's like it has the same routing

1696
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,040
so it's like it has the same routing
 

1697
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,309
so it's like it has the same routing
property of gradients that max pool does

1698
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:32,319
property of gradients that max pool does
 

1699
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,750
property of gradients that max pool does
except it's soft.

1700
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:35,760
except it's soft.
 

1701
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,430
except it's soft.
Okay.

1702
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:39,440

 

1703
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,150

So in particular, one doesn't have to

1704
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,160
So in particular, one doesn't have to
 

1705
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,670
So in particular, one doesn't have to
worry about having a residual skip

1706
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:43,680
worry about having a residual skip
 

1707
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,109
worry about having a residual skip
connection over this. This is already

1708
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:45,119
connection over this. This is already
 

1709
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,230
connection over this. This is already
giving you something that routes

1710
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,240
giving you something that routes
 

1711
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:58,950
giving you something that routes
gradients nicely. Yeah. Question.

1712
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:58,960

 

1713
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,030

Ah, great question. The question is, is

1714
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,040
Ah, great question. The question is, is
 

1715
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,430
Ah, great question. The question is, is
the clustering GNN, the GNN we're just

1716
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
the clustering GNN, the GNN we're just
 

1717
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,430
the clustering GNN, the GNN we're just
talking about, is it frozen during

1718
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:05,440
talking about, is it frozen during
 

1719
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,910
talking about, is it frozen during
training of the main GNN? No, it trains

1720
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:07,920
training of the main GNN? No, it trains
 

1721
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,270
training of the main GNN? No, it trains
with the main GNN.

1722
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:11,280
with the main GNN.
 

1723
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,870
with the main GNN.
You you choose its architecture and you

1724
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:12,880
You you choose its architecture and you
 

1725
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,790
You you choose its architecture and you
might initialize it based on information

1726
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:14,800
might initialize it based on information
 

1727
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,550
might initialize it based on information
from other related graphs. That's all

1728
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:16,560
from other related graphs. That's all
 

1729
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,950
from other related graphs. That's all
fine. But you let it tune for this

1730
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
fine. But you let it tune for this
 

1731
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,109
fine. But you let it tune for this
family of problems during training.

1732
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
family of problems during training.
 

1733
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,109
family of problems during training.
So that's the So remember this is

1734
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:25,119
So that's the So remember this is
 

1735
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,870
So that's the So remember this is
sending gradients nicely onto this, but

1736
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
sending gradients nicely onto this, but
 

1737
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,309
sending gradients nicely onto this, but
it's also sending gradients into these

1738
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:28,319
it's also sending gradients into these
 

1739
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,270
it's also sending gradients into these
S's. And these S's are the outputs of

1740
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:31,280
S's. And these S's are the outputs of
 

1741
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,150
S's. And these S's are the outputs of
the little GNN inside. So it's sending

1742
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:34,160
the little GNN inside. So it's sending
 

1743
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,829
the little GNN inside. So it's sending
gradients gradients are going to get

1744
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:35,839
gradients gradients are going to get
 

1745
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,910
gradients gradients are going to get
routed into that uh little GNN and that

1746
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:39,920
routed into that uh little GNN and that
 

1747
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,510
routed into that uh little GNN and that
little GNN is going to have updatable

1748
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:41,520
little GNN is going to have updatable
 

1749
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,829
little GNN is going to have updatable
weights and so on.

1750
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:43,839
weights and so on.
 

1751
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:44,390
weights and so on.
>> Yeah.

1752
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
>> Yeah.
 

1753
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,910
>> Yeah.
>> So are these new clusters the new

1754
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
>> So are these new clusters the new
 

1755
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,670
>> So are these new clusters the new
the connection.

1756
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:49,680
the connection.
 

1757
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,670
the connection.
>> Yes, the the the clusters are the new

1758
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:51,680
>> Yes, the the the clusters are the new
 

1759
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,190
>> Yes, the the the clusters are the new
nodes.

1760
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:53,200
nodes.
 

1761
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,309
nodes.
We're down sampling. We started with a

1762
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
We're down sampling. We started with a
 

1763
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,309
We're down sampling. We started with a
big graph that had n and now we have a

1764
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:56,319
big graph that had n and now we have a
 

1765
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,710
big graph that had n and now we have a
little graph that has k. The original

1766
00:44:58,710 --> 00:44:58,720
little graph that has k. The original
 

1767
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,990
little graph that has k. The original
graph had some connectivity structure

1768
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,000
graph had some connectivity structure
 

1769
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,230
graph had some connectivity structure
with some adjacy matrix and this one has

1770
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,240
with some adjacy matrix and this one has
 

1771
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,750
with some adjacy matrix and this one has
a new connectivity structure with a new

1772
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:03,760
a new connectivity structure with a new
 

1773
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,230
a new connectivity structure with a new
adjacy matrix. Except even if the

1774
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:06,240
adjacy matrix. Except even if the
 

1775
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,470
adjacy matrix. Except even if the
original adjacy matrix was filled with

1776
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:08,480
original adjacy matrix was filled with
 

1777
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,309
original adjacy matrix was filled with
zeros and ones, this one is going to

1778
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
zeros and ones, this one is going to
 

1779
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,589
zeros and ones, this one is going to
have adjacency matrices that has

1780
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:11,599
have adjacency matrices that has
 

1781
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,270
have adjacency matrices that has
fractional values in it.

1782
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:15,280
fractional values in it.
 

1783
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,710
fractional values in it.
Okay? Okay. So, it's a soft adjacency

1784
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:16,720
Okay? Okay. So, it's a soft adjacency
 

1785
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,470
Okay? Okay. So, it's a soft adjacency
matrix.

1786
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:18,480
matrix.
 

1787
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:30,390
matrix.
Yeah.

1788
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:30,400

 

1789
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,270

skips.

1790
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,280
skips.
 

1791
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,670
skips.
>> Yeah, great question. So, when we talked

1792
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
>> Yeah, great question. So, when we talked
 

1793
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,829
>> Yeah, great question. So, when we talked
about the skips for when you do the

1794
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:35,839
about the skips for when you do the
 

1795
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,309
about the skips for when you do the
downsampling, we said that was important

1796
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:38,319
downsampling, we said that was important
 

1797
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,430
downsampling, we said that was important
to do when you had a bunch of operations

1798
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
to do when you had a bunch of operations
 

1799
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,270
to do when you had a bunch of operations
together in a block that were doing the

1800
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:43,280
together in a block that were doing the
 

1801
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,190
together in a block that were doing the
downsampling like for example a strided

1802
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:45,200
downsampling like for example a strided
 

1803
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,109
downsampling like for example a strided
con.

1804
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:47,119
con.
 

1805
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,870
con.
But we made the there's a little

1806
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:48,880
But we made the there's a little
 

1807
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,750
But we made the there's a little
exception which is if your down sampling

1808
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:51,760
exception which is if your down sampling
 

1809
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,190
exception which is if your down sampling
is just a clean subsample or a clean max

1810
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:57,200
is just a clean subsample or a clean max
 

1811
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,510
is just a clean subsample or a clean max
pool nothing else entire block just

1812
00:45:59,510 --> 00:45:59,520
pool nothing else entire block just
 

1813
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,190
pool nothing else entire block just
consists of a subsample a max pool or an

1814
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:03,200
consists of a subsample a max pool or an
 

1815
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,910
consists of a subsample a max pool or an
average pool then that little tiny block

1816
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:05,920
average pool then that little tiny block
 

1817
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,470
average pool then that little tiny block
that only does not require a skip

1818
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:08,480
that only does not require a skip
 

1819
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,309
that only does not require a skip
because it by itself routes gradients

1820
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:10,319
because it by itself routes gradients
 

1821
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,990
because it by itself routes gradients
nicely.

1822
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:12,000
nicely.
 

1823
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,829
nicely.
So that's the special case from before.

1824
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:13,839
So that's the special case from before.
 

1825
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:18,150
So that's the special case from before.
And so this entire diff pool block

1826
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,160
And so this entire diff pool block
 

1827
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,510
And so this entire diff pool block
behaves like an like a max pool visav

1828
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:21,520
behaves like an like a max pool visav
 

1829
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,870
behaves like an like a max pool visav
routing of gradients and does not

1830
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:22,880
routing of gradients and does not
 

1831
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,069
routing of gradients and does not
require a skip across it.

1832
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:26,079
require a skip across it.
 

1833
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,150
require a skip across it.
>> Yeah, just this connection. So here you

1834
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:28,160
>> Yeah, just this connection. So here you
 

1835
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,309
>> Yeah, just this connection. So here you
have the small graph with K nodes and

1836
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:32,319
have the small graph with K nodes and
 

1837
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:37,109
have the small graph with K nodes and
here you have the big graph with nodes.

1838
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:37,119
here you have the big graph with nodes.
 

1839
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,270
here you have the big graph with nodes.
Just this does not require a skip.

1840
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
Just this does not require a skip.
 

1841
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,870
Just this does not require a skip.
Okay, so let's think about this. Our

1842
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
Okay, so let's think about this. Our
 

1843
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,670
Okay, so let's think about this. Our
original adjacency matrix at layer L is

1844
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:47,680
original adjacency matrix at layer L is
 

1845
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,470
original adjacency matrix at layer L is
N byN.

1846
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:50,480
N byN.
 

1847
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,309
N byN.
I need to have something which is K by

1848
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:54,319
I need to have something which is K by
 

1849
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,910
I need to have something which is K by
K.

1850
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:55,920
K.
 

1851
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,109
K.
So in interest of time I can just show

1852
00:46:59,109 --> 00:46:59,119
So in interest of time I can just show
 

1853
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,309
So in interest of time I can just show
you the answer, right? Basically I have

1854
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:02,319
you the answer, right? Basically I have
 

1855
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,990
you the answer, right? Basically I have
something that's n byn. I need to get it

1856
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
something that's n byn. I need to get it
 

1857
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,710
something that's n byn. I need to get it
to k by k. I have to ask myself what k

1858
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:06,720
to k by k. I have to ask myself what k
 

1859
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,670
to k by k. I have to ask myself what k
byn thing do I have?

1860
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:09,680
byn thing do I have?
 

1861
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,109
byn thing do I have?
Does everyone see that? Like I only I

1862
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:11,119
Does everyone see that? Like I only I
 

1863
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,390
Does everyone see that? Like I only I
have limited choices in what I have to

1864
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:12,400
have limited choices in what I have to
 

1865
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,870
have limited choices in what I have to
work with. The only k byn thing I have

1866
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:14,880
work with. The only k byn thing I have
 

1867
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:46,309
work with. The only k byn thing I have
is this s. So what is the s

1868
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:46,319

 

1869
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,710

It's all those probabilities.

1870
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:48,720
It's all those probabilities.
 

1871
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,790
It's all those probabilities.
I have n different nodes in my original

1872
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:50,800
I have n different nodes in my original
 

1873
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,230
I have n different nodes in my original
graph. I have probability assignments

1874
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:52,240
graph. I have probability assignments
 

1875
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,670
graph. I have probability assignments
for them. I call them little srposes,

1876
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:55,680
for them. I call them little srposes,
 

1877
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,069
for them. I call them little srposes,
stack them up, and I get an S matrix.

1878
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:00,079

 

1879
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,710

So then if I want to get something using

1880
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:02,720
So then if I want to get something using
 

1881
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,430
So then if I want to get something using
this matrix

1882
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:05,440
this matrix
 

1883
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,510
this matrix
that has k by k size starting with

1884
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:07,520
that has k by k size starting with
 

1885
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,270
that has k by k size starting with
something that's n byn this is the

1886
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,280
something that's n byn this is the
 

1887
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,750
something that's n byn this is the
natural operation just on getting the

1888
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
natural operation just on getting the
 

1889
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,430
natural operation just on getting the
sizes to work.

1890
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:15,440

 

1891
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,270

Okay this is just getting the sizes to

1892
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,280
Okay this is just getting the sizes to
 

1893
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,109
Okay this is just getting the sizes to
work.

1894
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:19,119
work.
 

1895
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,950
work.
So inside this matrix aig

1896
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:22,960
So inside this matrix aig
 

1897
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,670
So inside this matrix aig
represents how strong we want an edge

1898
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:25,680
represents how strong we want an edge
 

1899
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,790
represents how strong we want an edge
between cluster i and cluster j.

1900
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:30,800

 

1901
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,710

Once we went to soft assignments to

1902
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:34,720
Once we went to soft assignments to
 

1903
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,630
Once we went to soft assignments to
uh clusters, we're going to get soft

1904
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,640
uh clusters, we're going to get soft
 

1905
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,349
uh clusters, we're going to get soft
edges.

1906
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:39,359
edges.
 

1907
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,990
edges.
That just happens. Fortunately, having

1908
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:42,000
That just happens. Fortunately, having
 

1909
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,470
That just happens. Fortunately, having
soft edges is not a big deal for us

1910
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:44,480
soft edges is not a big deal for us
 

1911
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,750
soft edges is not a big deal for us
because we know how to adapt our

1912
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:45,760
because we know how to adapt our
 

1913
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,990
because we know how to adapt our
algorithms to having real number, single

1914
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
algorithms to having real number, single
 

1915
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,069
algorithms to having real number, single
real scalar numbers for the edge. We

1916
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:50,079
real scalar numbers for the edge. We
 

1917
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,829
real scalar numbers for the edge. We
just multiply the message on the edge by

1918
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:51,839
just multiply the message on the edge by
 

1919
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,670
just multiply the message on the edge by
that number. So you look at the

1920
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:53,680
that number. So you look at the
 

1921
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,430
that number. So you look at the
embedding across the edge. You just

1922
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:55,440
embedding across the edge. You just
 

1923
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:11,030
embedding across the edge. You just
scale it by the strength of the edge.

1924
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:11,040

 

1925
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,109

Okay. So

1926
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:13,119
Okay. So
 

1927
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,109
Okay. So
now we have a way to get a new adjacency

1928
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:17,119
now we have a way to get a new adjacency
 

1929
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,470
now we have a way to get a new adjacency
matrix for our graph. So

1930
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:20,480
matrix for our graph. So
 

1931
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,750
matrix for our graph. So
we have a GNN. To summarize, we have our

1932
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:23,760
we have a GNN. To summarize, we have our
 

1933
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,589
we have a GNN. To summarize, we have our
differentiable pooling operation has

1934
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:25,599
differentiable pooling operation has
 

1935
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,750
differentiable pooling operation has
going to have soft assignments. So it's

1936
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
going to have soft assignments. So it's
 

1937
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,069
going to have soft assignments. So it's
going to have the output of the GNN

1938
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:30,079
going to have the output of the GNN
 

1939
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,270
going to have the output of the GNN
inside of it is going to give

1940
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:31,280
inside of it is going to give
 

1941
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,829
inside of it is going to give
probability assignments for every node.

1942
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:33,839
probability assignments for every node.
 

1943
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,790
probability assignments for every node.
From that we will get soft edges for

1944
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:36,800
From that we will get soft edges for
 

1945
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,390
From that we will get soft edges for
between our K by K graph. Everything

1946
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:38,400
between our K by K graph. Everything
 

1947
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,510
between our K by K graph. Everything
will be connected to everything else

1948
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:39,520
will be connected to everything else
 

1949
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,230
will be connected to everything else
just with different weights and we'll

1950
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
just with different weights and we'll
 

1951
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,710
just with different weights and we'll
get new embeddings for everything. So we

1952
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:44,720
get new embeddings for everything. So we
 

1953
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,710
get new embeddings for everything. So we
can continue doing GNN processing after

1954
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:46,720
can continue doing GNN processing after
 

1955
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,470
can continue doing GNN processing after
this point.

1956
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:50,480

 

1957
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,349

Okay, so you get something that looks

1958
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:53,359
Okay, so you get something that looks
 

1959
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,470
Okay, so you get something that looks
like this.

1960
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:56,480
like this.
 

1961
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,190
like this.
Here's our graph neural net. We have

1962
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,200
Here's our graph neural net. We have
 

1963
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,990
Here's our graph neural net. We have
some graph processing layers with skips

1964
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,000
some graph processing layers with skips
 

1965
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,150
some graph processing layers with skips
on them.

1966
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:04,160
on them.
 

1967
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,710
on them.
Then we have a diff pool.

1968
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:06,720
Then we have a diff pool.
 

1969
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,950
Then we have a diff pool.
So we have a I'll label the size of the

1970
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:08,960
So we have a I'll label the size of the
 

1971
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,790
So we have a I'll label the size of the
graph.

1972
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:12,800

 

1973
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,510

So this is nodes.

1974
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:17,520

 

1975
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,150

This still has nodes.

1976
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:22,160

 

1977
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,549

Here we have k nodes.

1978
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:26,559

 

1979
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,030

This continues on.

1980
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:31,040
This continues on.
 

1981
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,470
This continues on.
Then there'll be some output layer and a

1982
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:32,480
Then there'll be some output layer and a
 

1983
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,630
Then there'll be some output layer and a
final loss.

1984
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:34,640
final loss.
 

1985
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,349
final loss.
So for GNN training, what happens is the

1986
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:37,359
So for GNN training, what happens is the
 

1987
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,589
So for GNN training, what happens is the
loss will send a gradient back. It'll go

1988
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
loss will send a gradient back. It'll go
 

1989
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,750
loss will send a gradient back. It'll go
back back.

1990
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:41,760
back back.
 

1991
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,430
back back.
It will then go inside the diff pool for

1992
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:45,440
It will then go inside the diff pool for
 

1993
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,829
It will then go inside the diff pool for
the little GNN sitting inside here and

1994
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:47,839
the little GNN sitting inside here and
 

1995
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,270
the little GNN sitting inside here and
it'll also go out back here.

1996
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,280
it'll also go out back here.
 

1997
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,150
it'll also go out back here.
This path through that routing will also

1998
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,160
This path through that routing will also
 

1999
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,309
This path through that routing will also
send gradients back but also through

2000
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:56,319
send gradients back but also through
 

2001
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:01,910
send gradients back but also through
this will send route gradients back.

2002
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:01,920

 

2003
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,829

Okay, so this is the strategy. So first

2004
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:05,839
Okay, so this is the strategy. So first
 

2005
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,150
Okay, so this is the strategy. So first
practically speaking when diff was

2006
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:08,160
practically speaking when diff was
 

2007
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,870
practically speaking when diff was
introduced it was the first really

2008
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:10,880
introduced it was the first really
 

2009
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,630
introduced it was the first really
practical

2010
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:12,640
practical
 

2011
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,750
practical
uh pooling mechanism that moved the

2012
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:15,760
uh pooling mechanism that moved the
 

2013
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,589
uh pooling mechanism that moved the
needle quite substantially on many graph

2014
00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:17,599
needle quite substantially on many graph
 

2015
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,190
needle quite substantially on many graph
problems since then there have been

2016
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,200
problems since then there have been
 

2017
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,109
problems since then there have been
other and modifications of this but I

2018
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:21,119
other and modifications of this but I
 

2019
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,309
other and modifications of this but I
think from a design point of view I want

2020
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:22,319
think from a design point of view I want
 

2021
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:25,910
think from a design point of view I want
to present this idea

2022
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:25,920

 

2023
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,870

so we can just train this end to end but

2024
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:28,880
so we can just train this end to end but
 

2025
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,309
so we can just train this end to end but
remember this thing you the question

2026
00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:30,319
remember this thing you the question
 

2027
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,309
remember this thing you the question
that was asked is this thing really

2028
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:32,319
that was asked is this thing really
 

2029
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,990
that was asked is this thing really
needs to have

2030
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,000
needs to have
 

2031
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,630
needs to have
information about the graph structure

2032
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:36,640
information about the graph structure
 

2033
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,030
information about the graph structure
and right now the information about the

2034
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:39,040
and right now the information about the
 

2035
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,430
and right now the information about the
graph structure isn't really present in

2036
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:41,440
graph structure isn't really present in
 

2037
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,510
graph structure isn't really present in
this end training. So you think about it

2038
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:43,520
this end training. So you think about it
 

2039
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,670
this end training. So you think about it
random initialization this is doing

2040
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:45,680
random initialization this is doing
 

2041
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,829
random initialization this is doing
potentially a really bad job of pooling

2042
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:47,839
potentially a really bad job of pooling
 

2043
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,190
potentially a really bad job of pooling
the network into clusters

2044
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:51,200
the network into clusters
 

2045
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,190
the network into clusters
and so everything from here is like not

2046
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:53,200
and so everything from here is like not
 

2047
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,950
and so everything from here is like not
very good gradients.

2048
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:56,960

 

2049
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,910

So just end to end training might not be

2050
00:51:59,910 --> 00:51:59,920
So just end to end training might not be
 

2051
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,510
So just end to end training might not be
giving the gradients you need to get

2052
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:01,520
giving the gradients you need to get
 

2053
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,790
giving the gradients you need to get
this thing to learn how to do its job

2054
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:04,800
this thing to learn how to do its job
 

2055
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,710
this thing to learn how to do its job
which is presumably to reflect something

2056
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:06,720
which is presumably to reflect something
 

2057
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,349
which is presumably to reflect something
about the graph structure. So we're

2058
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:09,359
about the graph structure. So we're
 

2059
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,829
about the graph structure. So we're
going to use a trick which is going to

2060
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:11,839
going to use a trick which is going to
 

2061
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,750
going to use a trick which is going to
we're going to use the trick of adding

2062
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:13,760
we're going to use the trick of adding
 

2063
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,870
we're going to use the trick of adding
auxiliary losses. So, so far when you

2064
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:16,880
auxiliary losses. So, so far when you
 

2065
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,910
auxiliary losses. So, so far when you
think about auxiliary losses,

2066
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:19,920
think about auxiliary losses,
 

2067
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,069
think about auxiliary losses,
these are loss functions you add during

2068
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:22,079
these are loss functions you add during
 

2069
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,150
these are loss functions you add during
training that are not the thing you're

2070
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:24,160
training that are not the thing you're
 

2071
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,630
training that are not the thing you're
actually interested in, but are there to

2072
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:26,640
actually interested in, but are there to
 

2073
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,190
actually interested in, but are there to
help training. So, you've seen these

2074
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:29,200
help training. So, you've seen these
 

2075
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,710
help training. So, you've seen these
things so far as regularizers,

2076
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:32,720
things so far as regularizers,
 

2077
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,390
things so far as regularizers,
right? You add some penalty, an L2

2078
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:34,400
right? You add some penalty, an L2
 

2079
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,790
right? You add some penalty, an L2
penalty or something to regularize

2080
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:36,800
penalty or something to regularize
 

2081
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,069
penalty or something to regularize
training. But that's only one sense. You

2082
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:40,079
training. But that's only one sense. You
 

2083
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,470
training. But that's only one sense. You
could do other things too. And this is

2084
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:42,480
could do other things too. And this is
 

2085
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,230
could do other things too. And this is
an example where doing something is

2086
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:44,240
an example where doing something is
 

2087
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,430
an example where doing something is
useful.

2088
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:45,440
useful.
 

2089
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,870
useful.
So what does this represent? The idea is

2090
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:48,880
So what does this represent? The idea is
 

2091
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,670
So what does this represent? The idea is
we know something about what this thing

2092
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:51,680
we know something about what this thing
 

2093
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,430
we know something about what this thing
is supposed to be doing. We have some

2094
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:53,440
is supposed to be doing. We have some
 

2095
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,349
is supposed to be doing. We have some
idea for what are desirable properties

2096
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
idea for what are desirable properties
 

2097
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,190
idea for what are desirable properties
of this.

2098
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:57,200
of this.
 

2099
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,990
of this.
We can add losses

2100
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,000
We can add losses
 

2101
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,950
We can add losses
to training that encourage this thing to

2102
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:02,960
to training that encourage this thing to
 

2103
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,710
to training that encourage this thing to
do the right thing, what we think think

2104
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:04,720
do the right thing, what we think think
 

2105
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,390
do the right thing, what we think think
is the right thing. And that will

2106
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:06,400
is the right thing. And that will
 

2107
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,069
is the right thing. And that will
combine with whatever end to end losses

2108
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:10,079
combine with whatever end to end losses
 

2109
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,670
combine with whatever end to end losses
and gradients are coming through to

2110
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:11,680
and gradients are coming through to
 

2111
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:18,309
and gradients are coming through to
hopefully encourage the right behavior.

2112
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:18,319

 

2113
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,069

So

2114
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:20,079
So
 

2115
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,190
So
what are some of the properties we want?

2116
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
what are some of the properties we want?
 

2117
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,430
what are some of the properties we want?
One property is we want to have the

2118
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:25,440
One property is we want to have the
 

2119
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,069
One property is we want to have the
clustering respect the graph topology.

2120
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
clustering respect the graph topology.
 

2121
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,230
clustering respect the graph topology.
That's the big idea. Clustering should

2122
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:30,240
That's the big idea. Clustering should
 

2123
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,990
That's the big idea. Clustering should
like have something to do with the graph

2124
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,000
like have something to do with the graph
 

2125
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,150
like have something to do with the graph
topology.

2126
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:34,160
topology.
 

2127
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,990
topology.
So

2128
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:36,000
So
 

2129
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,829
So
let me just uh use an example here.

2130
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:39,839
let me just uh use an example here.
 

2131
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,950
let me just uh use an example here.
Okay. To say how how to do that. Okay.

2132
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:42,960
Okay. To say how how to do that. Okay.
 

2133
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,309
Okay. To say how how to do that. Okay.
So let me I guess I'll this is the kind

2134
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:46,319
So let me I guess I'll this is the kind
 

2135
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,990
So let me I guess I'll this is the kind
of loss one can use but this is by

2136
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000
of loss one can use but this is by
 

2137
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,109
of loss one can use but this is by
itself is a bit hard to understand. So

2138
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:51,119
itself is a bit hard to understand. So
 

2139
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,309
itself is a bit hard to understand. So
let me just walk through it and I'll

2140
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:52,319
let me just walk through it and I'll
 

2141
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,870
let me just walk through it and I'll
give do an example.

2142
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:54,880
give do an example.
 

2143
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,870
give do an example.
Okay

2144
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:56,880
Okay
 

2145
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,190
Okay
if you want clustering to respect the

2146
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,200
if you want clustering to respect the
 

2147
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,630
if you want clustering to respect the
graph topology presumably the A matrix

2148
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:02,640
graph topology presumably the A matrix
 

2149
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,230
graph topology presumably the A matrix
has to figure into the loss. Does

2150
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:04,240
has to figure into the loss. Does
 

2151
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,230
has to figure into the loss. Does
everyone see that A is the graph

2152
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:06,240
everyone see that A is the graph
 

2153
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,950
everyone see that A is the graph
topology the adjacency matrix.

2154
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:08,960
topology the adjacency matrix.
 

2155
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,670
topology the adjacency matrix.
Okay, so I have the A matrix,

2156
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
Okay, so I have the A matrix,
 

2157
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,910
Okay, so I have the A matrix,
but the other thing I'm going to need is

2158
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:13,920
but the other thing I'm going to need is
 

2159
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,670
but the other thing I'm going to need is
something that the A matrix

2160
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:17,680
something that the A matrix
 

2161
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,190
something that the A matrix
something that should be like the A

2162
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:19,200
something that should be like the A
 

2163
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,230
something that should be like the A
matrix, right? If I want a loss, I have

2164
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,240
matrix, right? If I want a loss, I have
 

2165
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,309
matrix, right? If I want a loss, I have
this thing I want to aim for respecting

2166
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:24,319
this thing I want to aim for respecting
 

2167
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,230
this thing I want to aim for respecting
the graph topology A, I should have

2168
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:26,240
the graph topology A, I should have
 

2169
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,390
the graph topology A, I should have
something that's like it that has to

2170
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:28,400
something that's like it that has to
 

2171
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,710
something that's like it that has to
depend on the output of diff.

2172
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:32,720

 

2173
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,870

The output of diff is basically this S

2174
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:34,880
The output of diff is basically this S
 

2175
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,790
The output of diff is basically this S
matrix.

2176
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:36,800
matrix.
 

2177
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,309
matrix.
it gets used in some way but it's

2178
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:38,319
it gets used in some way but it's
 

2179
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:39,990
it gets used in some way but it's
basically the s matrix is the thing that

2180
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,000
basically the s matrix is the thing that
 

2181
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,910
basically the s matrix is the thing that
the graph pool the graph neural inside

2182
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:41,920
the graph pool the graph neural inside
 

2183
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,710
the graph pool the graph neural inside
is outputting.

2184
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:44,720
is outputting.
 

2185
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,069
is outputting.
So then I have a and I have to do some

2186
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:48,079
So then I have a and I have to do some
 

2187
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,470
So then I have a and I have to do some
loss on a that's related to s.

2188
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
loss on a that's related to s.
 

2189
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,710
loss on a that's related to s.
So one way of getting guessing this kind

2190
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:54,720
So one way of getting guessing this kind
 

2191
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,030
So one way of getting guessing this kind
of loss is just do the same kind of type

2192
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:57,040
of loss is just do the same kind of type
 

2193
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,829
of loss is just do the same kind of type
adjustments. A is n byn

2194
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:01,839
adjustments. A is n byn
 

2195
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:08,230
adjustments. A is n byn
right? S is has K and N in it. So I

2196
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:08,240
right? S is has K and N in it. So I
 

2197
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,270
right? S is has K and N in it. So I
can't subtract S. That would be like

2198
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,280
can't subtract S. That would be like
 

2199
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,430
can't subtract S. That would be like
type mismatch.

2200
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:13,440
type mismatch.
 

2201
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,430
type mismatch.
So I think of what operation can I do to

2202
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,440
So I think of what operation can I do to
 

2203
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,150
So I think of what operation can I do to
get something that's actually N byN? And

2204
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:18,160
get something that's actually N byN? And
 

2205
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,510
get something that's actually N byN? And
S SRRPOS is N byN.

2206
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:21,520
S SRRPOS is N byN.
 

2207
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,069
S SRRPOS is N byN.
This might not satisfy you as a

2208
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:24,079
This might not satisfy you as a
 

2209
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,790
This might not satisfy you as a
justification, but you should understand

2210
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:26,800
justification, but you should understand
 

2211
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,630
justification, but you should understand
that this is actually also a

2212
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:28,640
that this is actually also a
 

2213
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,230
that this is actually also a
justification.

2214
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:30,240
justification.
 

2215
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,910
justification.
I need something. I have this. I need

2216
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:33,920
I need something. I have this. I need
 

2217
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,710
I need something. I have this. I need
something of this size. Let's start with

2218
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:36,720
something of this size. Let's start with
 

2219
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,630
something of this size. Let's start with
what I have. I have S. Does that work?

2220
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:38,640
what I have. I have S. Does that work?
 

2221
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,710
what I have. I have S. Does that work?
No. What's wrong with it? Wrong shape.

2222
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:42,720
No. What's wrong with it? Wrong shape.
 

2223
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,230
No. What's wrong with it? Wrong shape.
What can I do with the shape to make it

2224
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,240
What can I do with the shape to make it
 

2225
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,510
What can I do with the shape to make it
the right shape? This.

2226
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,520
the right shape? This.
 

2227
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,910
the right shape? This.
Okay. Does this make any sense? Maybe it

2228
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:49,920
Okay. Does this make any sense? Maybe it
 

2229
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,309
Okay. Does this make any sense? Maybe it
does, maybe it doesn't. But at this

2230
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,319
does, maybe it doesn't. But at this
 

2231
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,470
does, maybe it doesn't. But at this
point, I can try running code

2232
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:56,480

 

2233
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,109

as a phil. It's important to internalize

2234
00:55:59,109 --> 00:55:59,119
as a phil. It's important to internalize
 

2235
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,630
as a phil. It's important to internalize
the deep learning ethos. Okay.

2236
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,640
the deep learning ethos. Okay.
 

2237
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,549
the deep learning ethos. Okay.
So, while I'm sitting down trying to

2238
00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:04,559
So, while I'm sitting down trying to
 

2239
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,549
So, while I'm sitting down trying to
think about it, I shouldn't let my GPU

2240
00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:06,559
think about it, I shouldn't let my GPU
 

2241
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,630
think about it, I shouldn't let my GPU
be idle. I paid a lot of money for that

2242
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:08,640
be idle. I paid a lot of money for that
 

2243
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,030
be idle. I paid a lot of money for that
thing, right? Go try this.

2244
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:13,040
thing, right? Go try this.
 

2245
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,750
thing, right? Go try this.
Did it help? It helped.

2246
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:15,760
Did it help? It helped.
 

2247
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,549
Did it help? It helped.
That's good enough. Right? Even if it

2248
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:18,559
That's good enough. Right? Even if it
 

2249
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,349
That's good enough. Right? Even if it
doesn't make any sense. Very important.

2250
00:56:21,349 --> 00:56:21,359
doesn't make any sense. Very important.
 

2251
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,990
doesn't make any sense. Very important.
Okay? But let's also try to understand

2252
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,000
Okay? But let's also try to understand
 

2253
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,549
Okay? But let's also try to understand
why this might make sense.

2254
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:28,559

 

2255
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,789

So, Here's

2256
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:32,799

 

2257
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:36,710

a little contrived example

2258
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:36,720
a little contrived example
 

2259
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,150
a little contrived example
of a graph

2260
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160

 

2261
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,470

for which we know we have an idea of

2262
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:44,480
for which we know we have an idea of
 

2263
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,230
for which we know we have an idea of
what the right idea of cluster should

2264
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:46,240
what the right idea of cluster should
 

2265
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:56,309
what the right idea of cluster should
be.

2266
00:56:56,309 --> 00:56:56,319

 

2267
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,910

Okay, does everyone see this little

2268
00:56:57,910 --> 00:56:57,920
Okay, does everyone see this little
 

2269
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,990
Okay, does everyone see this little
graph? I just made this to illustrate

2270
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,000
graph? I just made this to illustrate
 

2271
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,190
graph? I just made this to illustrate
what's happening. You should always do

2272
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,200
what's happening. You should always do
 

2273
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,870
what's happening. You should always do
these kind of examples. So here I have

2274
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:04,880
these kind of examples. So here I have
 

2275
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,109
these kind of examples. So here I have
three nodes connected to each other.

2276
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:07,119
three nodes connected to each other.
 

2277
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,870
three nodes connected to each other.
Three nodes connect to each other and

2278
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:08,880
Three nodes connect to each other and
 

2279
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,190
Three nodes connect to each other and
these two groupings of nodes are

2280
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,200
these two groupings of nodes are
 

2281
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,069
these two groupings of nodes are
connected with a single edge. So

2282
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:14,079
connected with a single edge. So
 

2283
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,630
connected with a single edge. So
intuitively if I tell you please cluster

2284
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:16,640
intuitively if I tell you please cluster
 

2285
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,270
intuitively if I tell you please cluster
this into two clusters, these should be

2286
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,280
this into two clusters, these should be
 

2287
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,309
this into two clusters, these should be
a cluster and these should be a cluster

2288
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:22,319
a cluster and these should be a cluster
 

2289
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,750
a cluster and these should be a cluster
from the topology point of view. Does

2290
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:23,760
from the topology point of view. Does
 

2291
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,789
from the topology point of view. Does
everyone see that? Okay. So now let's

2292
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:26,799
everyone see that? Okay. So now let's
 

2293
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,710
everyone see that? Okay. So now let's
see how does this manifest in the

2294
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:28,720
see how does this manifest in the
 

2295
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,950
see how does this manifest in the
adjacency matrix. And as soon as you see

2296
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:30,960
adjacency matrix. And as soon as you see
 

2297
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,309
adjacency matrix. And as soon as you see
how it manifests in the adjacency

2298
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:32,319
how it manifests in the adjacency
 

2299
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,789
how it manifests in the adjacency
matrix, you'll then believe why this is

2300
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:34,799
matrix, you'll then believe why this is
 

2301
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:38,630
matrix, you'll then believe why this is
a good idea.

2302
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:38,640

 

2303
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,470

So what is the adjacency matrix for

2304
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
So what is the adjacency matrix for
 

2305
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:47,510
So what is the adjacency matrix for
this?

2306
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:47,520

 

2307
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,069

So one, two, and three are all connected

2308
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:50,079
So one, two, and three are all connected
 

2309
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:57,109
So one, two, and three are all connected
to each other, right?

2310
00:57:57,109 --> 00:57:57,119

 

2311
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,789

Four, five, and six are all connected to

2312
00:57:58,789 --> 00:57:58,799
Four, five, and six are all connected to
 

2313
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:05,510
Four, five, and six are all connected to
each other.

2314
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:05,520

 

2315
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,470

Does everyone see that? And now four,

2316
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:08,480
Does everyone see that? And now four,
 

2317
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,990
Does everyone see that? And now four,
three and four are connected to each

2318
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,000
three and four are connected to each
 

2319
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:18,789
three and four are connected to each
other specifically.

2320
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:18,799

 

2321
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:34,710

Okay. Everything else is zeros.

2322
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:34,720

 

2323
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,750

Everyone see this is the adjacency

2324
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:35,760
Everyone see this is the adjacency
 

2325
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,870
Everyone see this is the adjacency
matrix. Now when you look at this

2326
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:38,880
matrix. Now when you look at this
 

2327
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,990
matrix. Now when you look at this
adjacency matrix, what adjacy matrix is

2328
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:42,000
adjacency matrix, what adjacy matrix is
 

2329
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,589
adjacency matrix, what adjacy matrix is
this almost like?

2330
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:47,599

 

2331
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,710

Right? This adjacy matrix is almost like

2332
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:50,720
Right? This adjacy matrix is almost like
 

2333
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,750
Right? This adjacy matrix is almost like
an adjacy matrix that doesn't have these

2334
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:53,760
an adjacy matrix that doesn't have these
 

2335
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,069
an adjacy matrix that doesn't have these
yellow ones in it.

2336
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:56,079
yellow ones in it.
 

2337
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,069
yellow ones in it.
This has a block of ones, a block of

2338
00:58:58,069 --> 00:58:58,079
This has a block of ones, a block of
 

2339
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,750
This has a block of ones, a block of
ones, zeros and zeros.

2340
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:01,760
ones, zeros and zeros.
 

2341
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,069
ones, zeros and zeros.
But that matrix is visibly low rank.

2342
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:06,079
But that matrix is visibly low rank.
 

2343
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,030
But that matrix is visibly low rank.
Do you see that? Like very very visibly

2344
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:09,040
Do you see that? Like very very visibly
 

2345
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,230
Do you see that? Like very very visibly
low a low rank matrix.

2346
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:12,240
low a low rank matrix.
 

2347
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,630
low a low rank matrix.
So that suggests ah wait a minute. If I

2348
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:16,640
So that suggests ah wait a minute. If I
 

2349
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,710
So that suggests ah wait a minute. If I
want to approximate A with something

2350
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:18,720
want to approximate A with something
 

2351
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,470
want to approximate A with something
that's kind of low ranky, that might be

2352
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:22,480
that's kind of low ranky, that might be
 

2353
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,109
that's kind of low ranky, that might be
a good idea. Once you start getting to

2354
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:25,119
a good idea. Once you start getting to
 

2355
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,829
a good idea. Once you start getting to
low ranky, you look here and you go, ah,

2356
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:27,839
low ranky, you look here and you go, ah,
 

2357
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,870
low ranky, you look here and you go, ah,
SSRpose, this is low rank because it has

2358
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:30,880
SSRpose, this is low rank because it has
 

2359
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,190
SSRpose, this is low rank because it has
a bottleneck of K, right? What is

2360
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:33,200
a bottleneck of K, right? What is
 

2361
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,510
a bottleneck of K, right? What is
SSRpose?

2362
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:37,520

 

2363
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,549

Show here. Remember this is S. So

2364
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:42,559
Show here. Remember this is S. So
 

2365
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:51,109
Show here. Remember this is S. So
this is

2366
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:51,119

 

2367
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,030

like that.

2368
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:53,040
like that.
 

2369
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,829
like that.
So this is a K little bottleneck of K.

2370
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:55,839
So this is a K little bottleneck of K.
 

2371
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,109
So this is a K little bottleneck of K.
So this is going to be a low rank

2372
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:57,119
So this is going to be a low rank
 

2373
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,710
So this is going to be a low rank
matrix.

2374
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:58,720
matrix.
 

2375
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,270
matrix.
So this example tells you, okay, this

2376
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:01,280
So this example tells you, okay, this
 

2377
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,950
So this example tells you, okay, this
makes sense.

2378
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:02,960
makes sense.
 

2379
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,750
makes sense.
So if this is going to have assignments

2380
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:05,760
So if this is going to have assignments
 

2381
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,390
So if this is going to have assignments
across clusters

2382
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:08,400
across clusters
 

2383
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,630
across clusters
that are probabilistic, you're going to

2384
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:10,640
that are probabilistic, you're going to
 

2385
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,349
that are probabilistic, you're going to
get most of this most of this and you'll

2386
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:13,359
get most of this most of this and you'll
 

2387
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,990
get most of this most of this and you'll
get some stuff here, you know, in these

2388
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:16,000
get some stuff here, you know, in these
 

2389
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,630
get some stuff here, you know, in these
spots in SSRpose

2390
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:20,640

 

2391
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,670

for a good basically matches this to one

2392
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:23,680
for a good basically matches this to one
 

2393
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:29,990
for a good basically matches this to one
and this to

2394
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:30,000

 

2395
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:39,349

>> Yes.

2396
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:39,359

 

2397
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:40,950

Yes.

2398
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
Yes.
 

2399
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:48,390
Yes.
share roughly the same

2400
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:48,400

 

2401
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,230

high.

2402
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:50,240
high.
 

2403
01:00:50,240 --> 01:01:09,430
high.
So the SST

2404
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:09,440

 

2405
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,670

>> um so we can talk more later. I'm not

2406
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:13,680
>> um so we can talk more later. I'm not
 

2407
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,510
>> um so we can talk more later. I'm not
100% following your question

2408
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:15,520
100% following your question
 

2409
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,470
100% following your question
specifically, but

2410
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:18,480
specifically, but
 

2411
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,109
specifically, but
what this is saying is that what this

2412
01:01:21,109 --> 01:01:21,119
what this is saying is that what this
 

2413
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,670
what this is saying is that what this
example is trying to illustrate is that

2414
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:23,680
example is trying to illustrate is that
 

2415
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,069
example is trying to illustrate is that
if if all of these vectors had S's, if

2416
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:28,079
if if all of these vectors had S's, if
 

2417
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,069
if if all of these vectors had S's, if
all these nodes had S's that basically

2418
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:30,079
all these nodes had S's that basically
 

2419
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,230
all these nodes had S's that basically
assigned them to one cluster and these

2420
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:32,240
assigned them to one cluster and these
 

2421
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,710
assigned them to one cluster and these
assigned to the different cluster, then

2422
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:34,720
assigned to the different cluster, then
 

2423
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,390
assigned to the different cluster, then
what you would get is just these ones

2424
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:38,400
what you would get is just these ones
 

2425
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,270
what you would get is just these ones
and just these ones. you wouldn't get

2426
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:41,280
and just these ones. you wouldn't get
 

2427
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,789
and just these ones. you wouldn't get
you'd get all these zeros and you

2428
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:42,799
you'd get all these zeros and you
 

2429
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,510
you'd get all these zeros and you
wouldn't get these things would also be

2430
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:45,520
wouldn't get these things would also be
 

2431
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,789
wouldn't get these things would also be
zero in that case.

2432
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:48,799
zero in that case.
 

2433
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:52,230
zero in that case.
So in that sense the rightish answer is

2434
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:52,240
So in that sense the rightish answer is
 

2435
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,589
So in that sense the rightish answer is
close. Okay. Now you're asking the

2436
01:01:55,589 --> 01:01:55,599
close. Okay. Now you're asking the
 

2437
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,750
close. Okay. Now you're asking the
question if these were probabilities

2438
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:57,760
question if these were probabilities
 

2439
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,150
question if these were probabilities
generic probabilities why would you get

2440
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:00,160
generic probabilities why would you get
 

2441
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,750
generic probabilities why would you get
things close to one? Is that your

2442
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:01,760
things close to one? Is that your
 

2443
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:13,109
things close to one? Is that your
question?

2444
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:13,119

 

2445
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,710

Oh, no you don't. Okay, so that's a good

2446
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:14,720
Oh, no you don't. Okay, so that's a good
 

2447
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,710
Oh, no you don't. Okay, so that's a good
question. You don't, right? Because um

2448
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:18,720
question. You don't, right? Because um
 

2449
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,109
question. You don't, right? Because um
if you have two entries that are similar

2450
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:21,119
if you have two entries that are similar
 

2451
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,829
if you have two entries that are similar
to each other, right? That doesn't mean

2452
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:23,839
to each other, right? That doesn't mean
 

2453
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,470
to each other, right? That doesn't mean
you're going to have to get a

2454
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:26,480
you're going to have to get a
 

2455
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,630
you're going to have to get a
a one

2456
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:28,640
a one
 

2457
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,069
a one
in that position because probabilities,

2458
01:02:32,069 --> 01:02:32,079
in that position because probabilities,
 

2459
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,750
in that position because probabilities,
if you take the even if you were doing

2460
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:33,760
if you take the even if you were doing
 

2461
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,910
if you take the even if you were doing
an inner product of probabilities. So

2462
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:35,920
an inner product of probabilities. So
 

2463
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,430
an inner product of probabilities. So
first let's look at it. You get inner

2464
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:39,440
first let's look at it. You get inner
 

2465
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,309
first let's look at it. You get inner
you're saying this thing is like

2466
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:40,319
you're saying this thing is like
 

2467
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:41,430
you're saying this thing is like
pairwise inner products of the

2468
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:41,440
pairwise inner products of the
 

2469
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,349
pairwise inner products of the
probabilities. So two probabilities that

2470
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:43,359
probabilities. So two probabilities that
 

2471
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,670
probabilities. So two probabilities that
are the same are going to be behave the

2472
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:45,680
are the same are going to be behave the
 

2473
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,990
are the same are going to be behave the
same way. But probabilities inner

2474
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,000
same way. But probabilities inner
 

2475
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,829
same way. But probabilities inner
products aren't necessarily going to go

2476
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:49,839
products aren't necessarily going to go
 

2477
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,990
products aren't necessarily going to go
to one.

2478
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:52,000
to one.
 

2479
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,950
to one.
Right?

2480
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:54,960
Right?
 

2481
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,390
Right?
Good question. It'll go to one if it's

2482
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,400
Good question. It'll go to one if it's
 

2483
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,430
Good question. It'll go to one if it's
one zero but not otherwise. But you

2484
01:02:59,430 --> 01:02:59,440
one zero but not otherwise. But you
 

2485
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,910
one zero but not otherwise. But you
Yeah.

2486
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:01,920
Yeah.
 

2487
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,990
Yeah.
>> Okay. Yes.

2488
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:04,000
>> Okay. Yes.
 

2489
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,950
>> Okay. Yes.
In this matrix, we're saying that every

2490
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:08,960
In this matrix, we're saying that every
 

2491

2493
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,789
>> Yes, every node is connected to self. We
just make that assumption. Every

2494
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:14,799
just make that assumption. Every
 

2495
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:15,190
just make that assumption. Every
>> Yes.

2496
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:15,200
>> Yes.
 

2497
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,270
>> Yes.
>> So, just to follow up on the previous

actually one. It's just that we're
 

2505
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,630
actually one. It's just that we're
trying to get as close to one as

2506
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:24,640
trying to get as close to one as
 

2507
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,910
trying to get as close to one as
possible.

that's is doing the right kind of thing

2516
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:35,280
that's is doing the right kind of thing
 

2517
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,430
that's is doing the right kind of thing
in this example things that are natural

will get rewarded by this kind of loss
 

2525
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,150
will get rewarded by this kind of loss
that's all we're doing this is a

2526
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:46,160
that's all we're doing this is a
 

2527
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:51,190
that's all we're doing this is a
heristic loss that we're making okay so

2528
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:51,200
heristic loss that we're making okay so
 

2529
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,510
heristic loss that we're making okay so
the second property we want is we would

2530
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:53,520
the second property we want is we would
 

2531
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,710
the second property we want is we would
like the cluster assignments to be as

2532
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:56,720
like the cluster assignments to be as
 

2533
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,710
like the cluster assignments to be as
close to hard assignments ments as we

2534
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:58,720
close to hard assignments ments as we
 

2535
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,549
close to hard assignments ments as we
can make them.

2536
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:00,559
can make them.
 

2537
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,230
can make them.
So we don't just want to we want to

2538
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:02,240
So we don't just want to we want to
 

2539
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,990
So we don't just want to we want to
respect the graph topology and we would

2540
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:04,000
respect the graph topology and we would
 

2541
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,870
respect the graph topology and we would
like to make nodes mostly assigned to a

2542
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:06,880
like to make nodes mostly assigned to a
 

2543
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,430
like to make nodes mostly assigned to a
a single cluster.

2544
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:09,440
a single cluster.
 

2545
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,150
a single cluster.
So we need something that will make have

2546
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:12,160
So we need something that will make have
 

2547
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,710
So we need something that will make have
that property and here's a way to do it.

2548
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:16,720
that property and here's a way to do it.
 

2549
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,630
that property and here's a way to do it.
We just take a sum over all the nodes of

2550
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:20,640
We just take a sum over all the nodes of
 

2551
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,069
We just take a sum over all the nodes of
some on a probability vector that

2552
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:24,079
some on a probability vector that
 

2553
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,910
some on a probability vector that
rewards

2554
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:25,920
rewards
 

2555
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,029
rewards
hard decisions.

2556
01:04:29,029 --> 01:04:29,039
hard decisions.
 

2557
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:34,230
hard decisions.
Okay. And entropy has that property

2558
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:34,240
Okay. And entropy has that property
 

2559
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,230
Okay. And entropy has that property
as an example. Entropy is maximized when

2560
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:38,240
as an example. Entropy is maximized when
 

2561
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,950
as an example. Entropy is maximized when
sorry is minimized whenever all the

2562
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:40,960
sorry is minimized whenever all the
 

2563
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,750
sorry is minimized whenever all the
probability is in one place and there

2564
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:43,760
probability is in one place and there
 

2565
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,069
probability is in one place and there
are zero probabilities elsewhere. That's

2566
01:04:46,069 --> 01:04:46,079
are zero probabilities elsewhere. That's
 

2567
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,670
are zero probabilities elsewhere. That's
the entropy minimizer.

2568
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:49,680

 

2569
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,309

So if we put entropy penalties on these

2570
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:54,319
So if we put entropy penalties on these
 

2571
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,910
So if we put entropy penalties on these
vectors that will encourage them to go

2572
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:57,920
vectors that will encourage them to go
 

2573
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,549
vectors that will encourage them to go
closer to one somewhere and zeros

2574
01:05:00,549 --> 01:05:00,559
closer to one somewhere and zeros
 

2575
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:04,150
closer to one somewhere and zeros
elsewhere.

2576
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:04,160

 

2577
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,549

So this is like another matter of saying

2578
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:06,559
So this is like another matter of saying
 

2579
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,910
So this is like another matter of saying
well I have this property I get because

2580
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:09,920
well I have this property I get because
 

2581
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,990
well I have this property I get because
remember I I started off wanting to do

2582
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:12,000
remember I I started off wanting to do
 

2583
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,309
remember I I started off wanting to do
clustering and I found just for

2584
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:14,319
clustering and I found just for
 

2585
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,270
clustering and I found just for
differentiability I couldn't do hard but

2586
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:17,280
differentiability I couldn't do hard but
 

2587
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,670
differentiability I couldn't do hard but
I still would like to do it as close to

2588
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:19,680
I still would like to do it as close to
 

2589
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,430
I still would like to do it as close to
hard as possible. So this property

2590
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:21,440
hard as possible. So this property
 

2591
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,109
hard as possible. So this property
emerges naturally. Then I look in my bag

2592
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:25,119
emerges naturally. Then I look in my bag
 

2593
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,710
emerges naturally. Then I look in my bag
of ingredients and I say is there

2594
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:28,720
of ingredients and I say is there
 

2595
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,430
of ingredients and I say is there
something that likes hard decisions or

2596
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:31,440
something that likes hard decisions or
 

2597
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,950
something that likes hard decisions or
you know happiest and hard decisions

2598
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:32,960
you know happiest and hard decisions
 

2599
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,589
you know happiest and hard decisions
maximized minimized. Yes I have entropy

2600
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:35,599
maximized minimized. Yes I have entropy
 

2601
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,069
maximized minimized. Yes I have entropy
just use it.

2602
01:05:38,069 --> 01:05:38,079
just use it.
 

2603
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,950
just use it.
So I think people saw entropy when you

2604
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:40,960
So I think people saw entropy when you
 

2605
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,510
So I think people saw entropy when you
saw decision tree uh generation probably

2606
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
saw decision tree uh generation probably
 

2607
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,750
saw decision tree uh generation probably
in your um for doing the splits where

2608
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:45,760
in your um for doing the splits where
 

2609
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,789
in your um for doing the splits where
you wanted purity of splits you were

2610
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:48,799
you wanted purity of splits you were
 

2611
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,349
you wanted purity of splits you were
using entropy to kind of reward purity

2612
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:51,359
using entropy to kind of reward purity
 

2613
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:55,349
using entropy to kind of reward purity
class purity uh in a in a split.

2614
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:55,359
class purity uh in a in a split.
 

2615
01:05:55,359 --> 01:06:01,990
class purity uh in a in a split.
So same kind of logic applied here.

2616
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:02,000

 

2617
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,230

Okay. So to summarize what happened. So

2618
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:06,240
Okay. So to summarize what happened. So
 

2619
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,230
Okay. So to summarize what happened. So
now I have these two auxiliary losses. I

2620
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:08,240
now I have these two auxiliary losses. I
 

2621
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,950
now I have these two auxiliary losses. I
add them during training. And now I have

2622
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:10,960
add them during training. And now I have
 

2623
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,510
add them during training. And now I have
a different pooling method that is

2624
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:13,520
a different pooling method that is
 

2625
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,230
a different pooling method that is
learnable called diffpool.

2626
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:16,240
learnable called diffpool.
 

2627
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,510
learnable called diffpool.
Um and to summarize the story we started

2628
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:19,520
Um and to summarize the story we started
 

2629
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,150
Um and to summarize the story we started
off over here. We knew how to do that.

2630
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,160
off over here. We knew how to do that.
 

2631
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,750
off over here. We knew how to do that.
We said okay we can talk about this if

2632
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,760
We said okay we can talk about this if
 

2633
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,750
We said okay we can talk about this if
we don't have pooling. But once we have

2634
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:29,760
we don't have pooling. But once we have
 

2635
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,069
we don't have pooling. But once we have
pooling, we move into this infinite edge

2636
01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:32,079
pooling, we move into this infinite edge
 

2637
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:37,589
pooling, we move into this infinite edge
labels that are scalar case

2638
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:37,599

 

2639
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,589

but just fine.

2640
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
but just fine.
 

2641
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,190
but just fine.
We know how to deal with that.

2642
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:43,200
We know how to deal with that.
 

2643
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:52,150
We know how to deal with that.
Okay. Any questions on diff. Yeah.

2644
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:52,160

 

2645
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:55,270

>> So in particular weights on edges. So

2646
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:55,280
>> So in particular weights on edges. So
 

2647
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:03,589
>> So in particular weights on edges. So
let me mark make a note of this.

2648
01:07:03,589 --> 01:07:03,599

 

2649
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,390

scalers,

2650
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:06,400
scalers,
 

2651
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,710
scalers,
the scaler weights. Why? Because our

2652
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:08,720
the scaler weights. Why? Because our
 

2653
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,710
the scaler weights. Why? Because our
adjacency matrix isn't 01. Our adjacency

2654
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:12,720
adjacency matrix isn't 01. Our adjacency
 

2655
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,950
adjacency matrix isn't 01. Our adjacency
matrix has fractional or other numbers

2656
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:14,960
matrix has fractional or other numbers
 

2657
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,390
matrix has fractional or other numbers
in it. So how do we use how do we take

2658
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:18,400
in it. So how do we use how do we take
 

2659
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,390
in it. So how do we use how do we take
advantage of that? The easiest way is

2660
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:20,400
advantage of that? The easiest way is
 

2661
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,829
advantage of that? The easiest way is
any embedding that goes across the edge

2662
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:23,839
any embedding that goes across the edge
 

2663
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,589
any embedding that goes across the edge
just multiply it by the weight inside

2664
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:25,599
just multiply it by the weight inside
 

2665
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,349
just multiply it by the weight inside
the edge. This is not a learnable

2666
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:27,359
the edge. This is not a learnable
 

2667
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,390
the edge. This is not a learnable
weight. This is like a a label, right?

2668
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:30,400
weight. This is like a a label, right?
 

2669
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,470
weight. This is like a a label, right?
Just it's just a fixed aspect of this

2670
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:32,480
Just it's just a fixed aspect of this
 

2671
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,270
Just it's just a fixed aspect of this
topology.

2672
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:35,280
topology.
 

2673
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,870
topology.
That's a way of taking information

2674
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:36,880
That's a way of taking information
 

2675
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,430
That's a way of taking information
across the edge naturally.

2676
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:39,440
across the edge naturally.
 

2677
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:50,390
across the edge naturally.
>> Yeah.

2678
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:50,400

 

2679
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,549

>> Yeah. So, it's a great question. There

2680
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:52,559
>> Yeah. So, it's a great question. There
 

2681
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,270
>> Yeah. So, it's a great question. There
there are approaches to doing pooling

2682
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:55,280
there are approaches to doing pooling
 

2683
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,309
there are approaches to doing pooling
that

2684
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:56,319
that
 

2685
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:59,910
that
are not learned that are tied to a

2686
01:07:59,910 --> 01:07:59,920
are not learned that are tied to a
 

2687
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,309
are not learned that are tied to a
specific application. So it says that

2688
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:02,319
specific application. So it says that
 

2689
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:05,190
specific application. So it says that
I'm just going to execute the following

2690
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:05,200
I'm just going to execute the following
 

2691
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,390
I'm just going to execute the following
uh algorithmic clustering and

2692
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:08,400
uh algorithmic clustering and
 

2693
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,829
uh algorithmic clustering and
downsampling of the graph. That's

2694
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:09,839
downsampling of the graph. That's
 

2695
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:11,829
downsampling of the graph. That's
application specific. So you can think

2696
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:11,839
application specific. So you can think
 

2697
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:14,309
application specific. So you can think
about CNN's as having done that. So CNN

2698
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:14,319
about CNN's as having done that. So CNN
 

2699
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:17,189
about CNN's as having done that. So CNN
say look I know images every other pixel

2700
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:17,199
say look I know images every other pixel
 

2701
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:19,749
say look I know images every other pixel
is a good way of downsampling.

2702
01:08:19,749 --> 01:08:19,759
is a good way of downsampling.
 

2703
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,829
is a good way of downsampling.
So it just you just do it. Same thing

2704
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:21,839
So it just you just do it. Same thing
 

2705
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,669
So it just you just do it. Same thing
for any graph. If you have a knowledge

2706
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
for any graph. If you have a knowledge
 

2707
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,590
for any graph. If you have a knowledge
of this family of graphs and you have an

2708
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:25,600
of this family of graphs and you have an
 

2709
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,189
of this family of graphs and you have an
algorithmic thing that you believe is a

2710
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:27,199
algorithmic thing that you believe is a
 

2711
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:29,110
algorithmic thing that you believe is a
good way of downsampling the graph, you

2712
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:29,120
good way of downsampling the graph, you
 

2713
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:34,149
good way of downsampling the graph, you
can just drop that into your network.

2714
01:08:34,149 --> 01:08:34,159

 

2715
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:38,070

You just do that. Um, and then you still

2716
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:38,080
You just do that. Um, and then you still
 

2717
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,829
You just do that. Um, and then you still
what that does is basically instead of

2718
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:39,839
what that does is basically instead of
 

2719
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,470
what that does is basically instead of
having a graph. So this remember what

2720
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,480
having a graph. So this remember what
 

2721
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,669
having a graph. So this remember what
does this graph gen what does this thing

2722
01:08:43,669 --> 01:08:43,679
does this graph gen what does this thing
 

2723
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:52,709
does this graph gen what does this thing
do? This thing generates

2724
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:52,719

 

2725
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,229

S.

2726
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:54,239
S.
 

2727
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:55,990
S.
The operation of the graph neural net

2728
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:56,000
The operation of the graph neural net
 

2729
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,390
The operation of the graph neural net
inside here just generates S. So if you

2730
01:08:58,390 --> 01:08:58,400
inside here just generates S. So if you
 

2731
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,990
inside here just generates S. So if you
have another way of getting S which is

2732
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:00,000
have another way of getting S which is
 

2733
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,309
have another way of getting S which is
assignments like how do I assign this

2734
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:02,319
assignments like how do I assign this
 

2735
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,630
assignments like how do I assign this
node to a cluster

2736
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:04,640
node to a cluster
 

2737
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,709
node to a cluster
then go ahead and use that. You can

2738
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,719
then go ahead and use that. You can
 

2739
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:11,430
then go ahead and use that. You can
still do these operations to get new

2740
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:11,440
still do these operations to get new
 

2741
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,910
still do these operations to get new
embeddings and new adjacency matrices

2742
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:13,920
embeddings and new adjacency matrices
 

2743
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,550
embeddings and new adjacency matrices
for the new graph

2744
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:16,560
for the new graph
 

2745
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,550
for the new graph
except the inside of that operation will

2746
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:18,560
except the inside of that operation will
 

2747
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,829
except the inside of that operation will
not be differentiable or not something

2748
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:19,839
not be differentiable or not something
 

2749
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:23,269
not be differentiable or not something
you want to learn. That's also fine. I'm

2750
01:09:23,269 --> 01:09:23,279
you want to learn. That's also fine. I'm
 

2751
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,189
you want to learn. That's also fine. I'm
talking about the a gener uh something

2752
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:25,199
talking about the a gener uh something
 

2753
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:28,870
talking about the a gener uh something
you can use if you don't know what to do

2754
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:28,880
you can use if you don't know what to do
 

2755
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:35,990
you can use if you don't know what to do
uh specific for your application.

2756
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:36,000

 

2757
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,789

So this is useful also to help think as

2758
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:38,799
So this is useful also to help think as
 

2759
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,229
So this is useful also to help think as
an example of how does one think about

2760
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:40,239
an example of how does one think about
 

2761
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:42,309
an example of how does one think about
these kinds of problems. How to follow

2762
01:09:42,309 --> 01:09:42,319
these kinds of problems. How to follow
 

2763
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,070
these kinds of problems. How to follow
the example of I don't know what to do.

2764
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:44,080
the example of I don't know what to do.
 

2765
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,910
the example of I don't know what to do.
Make it learnable.

2766
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
Make it learnable.
 

2767
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,910
Make it learnable.
I I have an obstacle. This is not

2768
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:49,920
I I have an obstacle. This is not
 

2769
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,269
I I have an obstacle. This is not
differentiable. How to break that

2770
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:51,279
differentiable. How to break that
 

2771
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:54,550
differentiable. How to break that
obstacle? Make it soft. I get a method.

2772
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:54,560
obstacle? Make it soft. I get a method.
 

2773
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,030
obstacle? Make it soft. I get a method.
I can train it end to end. It might not

2774
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:57,040
I can train it end to end. It might not
 

2775
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,030
I can train it end to end. It might not
do exactly what I want. Well, I can add

2776
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,040
do exactly what I want. Well, I can add
 

2777
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,630
do exactly what I want. Well, I can add
auxiliary losses to get what I want.

2778
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:02,640
auxiliary losses to get what I want.
 

2779
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,870
auxiliary losses to get what I want.
These are generic ways of thinking. This

2780
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:04,880
These are generic ways of thinking. This
 

2781
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,270
These are generic ways of thinking. This
approach helps you see that.

2782
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:07,280
approach helps you see that.
 

2783
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:15,270
approach helps you see that.
>> Yeah.

2784
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,280

 

2785
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,350

>> Excellent question. So remember all

2786
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:17,360
>> Excellent question. So remember all

losses are used when one is doing back

2788
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:20,320
losses are used when one is doing back
 

2789
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,149
losses are used when one is doing back
prop

2790
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:22,159
prop
 

2791
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,630
prop
right. So

2792
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:24,640
right. So
 

2793
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,830
right. So
they are they're done that way. When in

2794
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:27,840
they are they're done that way. When in
 

2795
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,350
they are they're done that way. When in
forward operation of the network they

2796
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:29,360
forward operation of the network they
 

2797
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,110
forward operation of the network they
don't do anything in the in back prop

2798
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,120
don't do anything in the in back prop
 

2799
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,630
don't do anything in the in back prop
they exist as losses. Now

2800
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
they exist as losses. Now
 

2801
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,070
they exist as losses. Now
you can say am I adding them to the

2802
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,080
you can say am I adding them to the
 

2803
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,390
you can say am I adding them to the
final loss? In a way yes I'm adding them

2804
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:40,400
final loss? In a way yes I'm adding them
 

2805
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,189
final loss? In a way yes I'm adding them
to the final loss and so there's some

2806
01:10:43,189 --> 01:10:43,199
to the final loss and so there's some
 

2807
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,950
to the final loss and so there's some
hyperparameter of how much I weight

2808
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:44,960
hyperparameter of how much I weight
 

2809
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,510
hyperparameter of how much I weight
these different auxiliary losses which

2810
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:47,520
these different auxiliary losses which
 

2811
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,870
these different auxiliary losses which
has to be tuned for the problem. Um

2812
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:50,880
has to be tuned for the problem. Um
 

2813
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,830
has to be tuned for the problem. Um
however these losses look inside the

2814
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:53,840
however these losses look inside the
 

2815
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,630
however these losses look inside the
diff pool and they look at the A and the

2816
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:56,640
diff pool and they look at the A and the
 

2817
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,709
diff pool and they look at the A and the
S

2818
01:10:58,709 --> 01:10:58,719
S
 

2819
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,669
S
right so they are looking at things that

2820
01:11:01,669 --> 01:11:01,679
right so they are looking at things that
 

2821
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:02,950
right so they are looking at things that
are different than just the output of

2822
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:02,960
are different than just the output of
 

2823
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,189
are different than just the output of
the network so in that sense they're

2824
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:05,199
the network so in that sense they're
 

2825
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:17,430
the network so in that sense they're
attached to the diff pool itself

2826
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:17,440

 

2827
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,189

>> um okay it's a great question how do we

2828
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:19,199
>> um okay it's a great question how do we
 

2829
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,350
>> um okay it's a great question how do we
illustrate this idea a of putting a loss

2830
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:21,360
illustrate this idea a of putting a loss
 

2831
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,990
illustrate this idea a of putting a loss
here. Okay, great question. So let's

2832
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:24,000
here. Okay, great question. So let's
 

2833
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,830
here. Okay, great question. So let's
think about it from the so use this red,

2834
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:25,840
think about it from the so use this red,
 

2835
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,350
think about it from the so use this red,
right?

2836
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:27,360
right?
 

2837
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,830
right?
So this is the loss. What we do is we

2838
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:29,840
So this is the loss. What we do is we
 

2839
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:37,430
So this is the loss. What we do is we
say

2840
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:37,440

 

2841
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,149

just attach the auxiliary loss here from

2842
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:40,159
just attach the auxiliary loss here from
 

2843
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,630
just attach the auxiliary loss here from
a picture point of view. It's not going

2844
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:42,640
a picture point of view. It's not going
 

2845
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,950
a picture point of view. It's not going
ahead to the end loss. This is the loss

2846
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:44,960
ahead to the end loss. This is the loss
 

2847
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,430
ahead to the end loss. This is the loss
on the output. So we call this is the

2848
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:47,440
on the output. So we call this is the
 

2849
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:52,950
on the output. So we call this is the
output loss, the normal loss.

2850
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:52,960

 

2851
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,430

We just have another loss. Stick it on

2852
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:55,440
We just have another loss. Stick it on
 

2853
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,310
We just have another loss. Stick it on
here. When you do gradients, all losses

2854
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:58,320
here. When you do gradients, all losses
 

2855
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,709
here. When you do gradients, all losses
will push flow gradients back. So this

2856
01:12:00,709 --> 01:12:00,719
will push flow gradients back. So this
 

2857
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,229
will push flow gradients back. So this
flows a gradient back and this will also

2858
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:02,239
flows a gradient back and this will also
 

2859
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:04,790
flows a gradient back and this will also
flow a gradient back. So this thing's

2860
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:04,800
flow a gradient back. So this thing's
 

2861
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,110
flow a gradient back. So this thing's
gradient will flow back into here to do

2862
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:07,120
gradient will flow back into here to do
 

2863
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,669
gradient will flow back into here to do
two things. It's going to say to the

2864
01:12:09,669 --> 01:12:09,679
two things. It's going to say to the
 

2865
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:12,470
two things. It's going to say to the
learnable weights inside of here, do the

2866
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:12,480
learnable weights inside of here, do the
 

2867
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,790
learnable weights inside of here, do the
right thing. But it's also going to flow

2868
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:14,800
right thing. But it's also going to flow
 

2869
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,910
right thing. But it's also going to flow
back over here to say hey put the right

2870
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:17,920
back over here to say hey put the right
 

2871
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,750
back over here to say hey put the right
kind of information in the embedding so

2872
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:19,760
kind of information in the embedding so
 

2873
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:26,310
kind of information in the embedding so
that this thing can do the right thing.

2874
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:26,320

 

2875
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,550

>> Yes, excellent point. So everyone heard

2876
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:28,560
>> Yes, excellent point. So everyone heard
 

2877
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,870
>> Yes, excellent point. So everyone heard
that the key word is important linear

2878
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:30,880
that the key word is important linear
 

2879
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,830
that the key word is important linear
combination. Remember the whole point of

2880
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:33,840
combination. Remember the whole point of
 

2881
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,669
combination. Remember the whole point of
backrop and the chain rule is that from

2882
01:12:35,669 --> 01:12:35,679
backrop and the chain rule is that from
 

2883
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:37,189
backrop and the chain rule is that from
the derivative point of view everything

2884
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199
the derivative point of view everything
 

2885
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,149
the derivative point of view everything
is linear. All the backrop operations

2886
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:40,159
is linear. All the backrop operations
 

2887
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:42,550
is linear. All the backrop operations
are linear. There's no nonlinearity in

2888
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:42,560
are linear. There's no nonlinearity in
 

2889
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,350
are linear. There's no nonlinearity in
backdrop. So because all of the backdrop

2890
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:45,360
backdrop. So because all of the backdrop
 

2891
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,350
backdrop. So because all of the backdrop
is linear, superposition of losses

2892
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
is linear, superposition of losses
 

2893
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,189
is linear, superposition of losses
works,

2894
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:49,199
works,
 

2895
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,310
works,
right? So you get this linear

2896
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:50,320
right? So you get this linear
 

2897
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,510
right? So you get this linear
combination of the the gradients seen

2898
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:53,520
combination of the the gradients seen
 

2899
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,070
combination of the the gradients seen
here are superposition of the gradients

2900
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,080
here are superposition of the gradients
 

2901
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,550
here are superposition of the gradients
coming from this auxiliary loss and the

2902
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
coming from this auxiliary loss and the
 

2903
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,630
coming from this auxiliary loss and the
gradients coming back from that loss.

2904
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:02,640
gradients coming back from that loss.
 

2905
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,910
gradients coming back from that loss.
Great question.

2906
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:07,920

 

2907
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,990

Okay,

2908
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,000
Okay,
 

2909
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,750
Okay,
so I got through this more slowly than I

2910
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:13,760
so I got through this more slowly than I
 

2911
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,669
so I got through this more slowly than I
thought. So I'll finally want to come do

2912
01:13:15,669 --> 01:13:15,679
thought. So I'll finally want to come do
 

2913
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,669
thought. So I'll finally want to come do
a couple more little points from GNN's

2914
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:17,679
a couple more little points from GNN's
 

2915
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,310
a couple more little points from GNN's
before we finish off GNN's.

2916
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:20,320
before we finish off GNN's.
 

2917
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,830
before we finish off GNN's.
So

2918
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:21,840
So
 

2919
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,830
So
there's

2920
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:23,840
there's
 

2921
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,950
there's
one final challenge in GNN's which is

2922
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:26,960
one final challenge in GNN's which is
 

2923
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,030
one final challenge in GNN's which is
how to think about held out data. So

2924
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,040
how to think about held out data. So
 

2925
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,510
how to think about held out data. So
I'll go through this pretty fast. So

2926
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:31,520
I'll go through this pretty fast. So
 

2927
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,070
I'll go through this pretty fast. So
held out data is absolutely required to

2928
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:34,080
held out data is absolutely required to
 

2929
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,390
held out data is absolutely required to
do machine learning, right? You have to

2930
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:36,400
do machine learning, right? You have to
 

2931
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,149
do machine learning, right? You have to
have held out data. You need held out

2932
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:38,159
have held out data. You need held out
 

2933
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:39,590
have held out data. You need held out
data to do validation. You need held out

2934
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:39,600
data to do validation. You need held out
 

2935
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,270
data to do validation. You need held out
to do testing. You need always have held

2936
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:41,280
to do testing. You need always have held
 

2937
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,510
to do testing. You need always have held
out data.

2938
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:43,520
out data.
 

2939
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,630
out data.
So in images, how do you do held out

2940
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:46,640
So in images, how do you do held out
 

2941
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,709
So in images, how do you do held out
data? You do held out data by holding

2942
01:13:48,709 --> 01:13:48,719
data? You do held out data by holding
 

2943
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,030
data? You do held out data by holding
entire images out.

2944
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:51,040
entire images out.
 

2945
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,030
entire images out.
Everyone with me?

2946
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:53,040
Everyone with me?
 

2947
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,229
Everyone with me?
Okay. in graphs because we have the idea

2948
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:56,239
Okay. in graphs because we have the idea
 

2949
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:59,030
Okay. in graphs because we have the idea
of node level problems we have other

2950
01:13:59,030 --> 01:13:59,040
of node level problems we have other
 

2951
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,270
of node level problems we have other
things we can also hold out and this is

2952
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:01,280
things we can also hold out and this is
 

2953
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,950
things we can also hold out and this is
particularly important when you're

2954
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:02,960
particularly important when you're
 

2955
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,750
particularly important when you're
studying a given graph so if you're

2956
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,760
studying a given graph so if you're
 

2957
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,510
studying a given graph so if you're
studying the Facebook's graph which is

2958
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:07,520
studying the Facebook's graph which is
 

2959
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,110
studying the Facebook's graph which is
Facebook's network it's not like

2960
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:09,120
Facebook's network it's not like
 

2961
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,270
Facebook's network it's not like
Facebook can hold back a separate

2962
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:11,280
Facebook can hold back a separate
 

2963
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,270
Facebook can hold back a separate
Facebook graph

2964
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:13,280
Facebook graph
 

2965
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:17,270
Facebook graph
it just has the real Facebook graph

2966
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:17,280
it just has the real Facebook graph
 

2967
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,270
it just has the real Facebook graph
so you have to figure out how to hold

2968
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:19,280
so you have to figure out how to hold
 

2969
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:23,830
so you have to figure out how to hold
out data on a single graph so the First

2970
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:23,840
out data on a single graph so the First
 

2971
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,750
out data on a single graph so the First
approach is during training you excise

2972
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:27,760
approach is during training you excise
 

2973
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,709
approach is during training you excise
entire nodes from the graph.

2974
01:14:30,709 --> 01:14:30,719
entire nodes from the graph.
 

2975
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,950
entire nodes from the graph.
Just remove them from the graph.

2976
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:34,960
Just remove them from the graph.
 

2977
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,870
Just remove them from the graph.
They're held out. You bring them back to

2978
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:36,880
They're held out. You bring them back to
 

2979
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,950
They're held out. You bring them back to
see what does the learned algorithm say

2980
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:38,960
see what does the learned algorithm say
 

2981
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,470
see what does the learned algorithm say
predict for those nodes. But it wasn't

2982
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:40,480
predict for those nodes. But it wasn't
 

2983
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,030
predict for those nodes. But it wasn't
trained on them. They're gone.

2984
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:43,040
trained on them. They're gone.
 

2985
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,550
trained on them. They're gone.
Everyone understand this as a highle

2986
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:44,560
Everyone understand this as a highle
 

2987
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,550
Everyone understand this as a highle
approach. Just like if you want to hold

2988
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
approach. Just like if you want to hold
 

2989
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,950
approach. Just like if you want to hold
something out, just remove it.

2990
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:48,960
something out, just remove it.
 

2991
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,709
something out, just remove it.
Okay. The challenge with this is this

2992
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:52,719
Okay. The challenge with this is this
 

2993
01:14:52,719 --> 01:15:04,310
Okay. The challenge with this is this
impacts connectivity

2994
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:04,320

 

2995
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:05,990

because remember the gra the nodes in

2996
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:06,000
because remember the gra the nodes in
 

2997
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,910
because remember the gra the nodes in
the graph are doing double duty. They

2998
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:07,920
the graph are doing double duty. They
 

2999
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,830
the graph are doing double duty. They
have information in them but they also

3000
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:09,840
have information in them but they also
 

3001
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,750
have information in them but they also
have connections and those connections

3002
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:11,760
have connections and those connections
 

3003
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:15,110
have connections and those connections
are used for information processing.

3004
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,120
are used for information processing.
 

3005
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,910
are used for information processing.
The example that makes it more easy to

3006
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:17,920
The example that makes it more easy to
 

3007
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,390
The example that makes it more easy to
see is if you're doing held out nodes in

3008
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400
see is if you're doing held out nodes in
 

3009
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,750
see is if you're doing held out nodes in
a chemical graph, if you just removed

3010
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:23,760
a chemical graph, if you just removed
 

3011
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,830
a chemical graph, if you just removed
atoms,

3012
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:25,840
atoms,
 

3013
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,750
atoms,
right, completely

3014
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:27,760
right, completely
 

3015
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,390
right, completely
that's like very bad, right? You really

3016
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
that's like very bad, right? You really
 

3017
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,070
that's like very bad, right? You really
are like changing the structure of this

3018
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:32,080
are like changing the structure of this
 

3019
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,510
are like changing the structure of this
thing quite substantially. So you can't

3020
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
thing quite substantially. So you can't
 

3021
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,390
thing quite substantially. So you can't
you're messing up the graph topology.

3022
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:38,400
you're messing up the graph topology.
 

3023
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,709
you're messing up the graph topology.
So what else can you do? What you want

3024
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:40,719
So what else can you do? What you want
 

3025
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:42,950
So what else can you do? What you want
to do is you want to remove the content

3026
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:42,960
to do is you want to remove the content
 

3027
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,870
to do is you want to remove the content
from the node

3028
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:44,880
from the node
 

3029
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,669
from the node
like get rid of the content

3030
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:47,679
like get rid of the content
 

3031
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,149
like get rid of the content
but I want to leave the node in

3032
01:15:52,149 --> 01:15:52,159
but I want to leave the node in
 

3033
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:54,470
but I want to leave the node in
okay so I want a node that's emptied of

3034
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
okay so I want a node that's emptied of
 

3035
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:59,510
okay so I want a node that's emptied of
its content.

3036
01:15:59,510 --> 01:15:59,520

 

3037
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,510

So

3038
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:01,520
So
 

3039
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,790
So
you had

3040
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:04,800

 

3041
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,870

a node connected to various things

3042
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:08,880
a node connected to various things
 

3043
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,750
a node connected to various things
and had some vector in it.

3044
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:11,760
and had some vector in it.
 

3045
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,030
and had some vector in it.
I want to replace this with

3046
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:15,040
I want to replace this with
 

3047
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,790
I want to replace this with
the same connections

3048
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:18,800

 

3049
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,910

but with nothing inside

3050
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
but with nothing inside
 

3051
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,110
but with nothing inside
spiritually. Everyone see that

3052
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:25,120
spiritually. Everyone see that
 

3053
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:30,709
spiritually. Everyone see that
problem is we what's nothing

3054
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:30,719

 

3055
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,189

right how do I put nothing inside the

3056
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,199
right how do I put nothing inside the
 

3057
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:36,550
right how do I put nothing inside the
node because the operations so I can say

3058
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:36,560
node because the operations so I can say
 

3059
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,070
node because the operations so I can say
I simply have nothing there to which

3060
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:40,080
I simply have nothing there to which
 

3061
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,709
I simply have nothing there to which
point I'll get a null pointer right and

3062
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:42,719
point I'll get a null pointer right and
 

3063
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,310
point I'll get a null pointer right and
I'll try to reference information for

3064
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:44,320
I'll try to reference information for
 

3065
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,390
I'll try to reference information for
doing a matrix multiply and there'll be

3066
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
doing a matrix multiply and there'll be
 

3067
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,990
doing a matrix multiply and there'll be
nothing there and fault

3068
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:50,000
nothing there and fault
 

3069
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,470
nothing there and fault
I can't do nothing there's no such thing

3070
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:52,480
I can't do nothing there's no such thing
 

3071
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,870
I can't do nothing there's no such thing
says nothing. Does everyone see this?

3072
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
says nothing. Does everyone see this?
 

3073
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,630
says nothing. Does everyone see this?
It's like a might be annoying, but it's

3074
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:56,640
It's like a might be annoying, but it's
 

3075
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,790
It's like a might be annoying, but it's
a real problem.

3076
01:16:58,790 --> 01:16:58,800
a real problem.
 

3077
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:08,229
a real problem.
So, what do I put here?

3078
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239

 

3079
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,070

Okay, did everyone understand the

3080
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,080
Okay, did everyone understand the
 

3081
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,870
Okay, did everyone understand the
problem? So, there's a couple of

3082
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:12,880
problem? So, there's a couple of
 

3083
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,630
problem? So, there's a couple of
choices. One is to do the kinds of

3084
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:16,640
choices. One is to do the kinds of
 

3085
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,630
choices. One is to do the kinds of
things that you might have seen. I don't

3086
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:18,640
things that you might have seen. I don't
 

3087
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,750
things that you might have seen. I don't
know if you've seen it in your machine

3088
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:19,760
know if you've seen it in your machine
 

3089
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,630
know if you've seen it in your machine
learning class. The idea of like imputed

3090
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:22,640
learning class. The idea of like imputed
 

3091
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,910
learning class. The idea of like imputed
values. Do you see imputed values? Who's

3092
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:25,920
values. Do you see imputed values? Who's
 

3093
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,070
values. Do you see imputed values? Who's
who's seen imputed values for where

3094
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,080
who's seen imputed values for where
 

3095
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,709
who's seen imputed values for where
you're missing data?

3096
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
you're missing data?
 

3097
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,590
you're missing data?
A few people. Who has not never heard of

3098
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:33,600
A few people. Who has not never heard of
 

3099
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,830
A few people. Who has not never heard of
imputed values? It's totally fine if you

3100
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:35,840
imputed values? It's totally fine if you
 

3101
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,950
imputed values? It's totally fine if you
haven't. Okay, great. So there's a set

3102
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:38,960
haven't. Okay, great. So there's a set
 

3103
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,790
haven't. Okay, great. So there's a set
of methods that people have for when you

3104
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:40,800
of methods that people have for when you
 

3105
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,709
of methods that people have for when you
have missing data, which is to say,

3106
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:42,719
have missing data, which is to say,
 

3107
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,390
have missing data, which is to say,
well, if I'm missing data, replace it

3108
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:44,400
well, if I'm missing data, replace it
 

3109
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,510
well, if I'm missing data, replace it
with an average. Um, replace it with

3110
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
with an average. Um, replace it with
 

3111
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,830
with an average. Um, replace it with
things like that. Those kinds of

3112
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:49,840
things like that. Those kinds of
 

3113
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,470
things like that. Those kinds of
approaches are possible. But in the

3114
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:52,480
approaches are possible. But in the
 

3115
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,470
approaches are possible. But in the
context of graph neural nets and the

3116
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:54,480
context of graph neural nets and the
 

3117
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,110
context of graph neural nets and the
context of machine learning, we have

3118
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:57,120
context of machine learning, we have
 

3119
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,350
context of machine learning, we have
another choice that we all we often try

3120
01:17:59,350 --> 01:17:59,360
another choice that we all we often try
 

3121
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,709
another choice that we all we often try
to prefer especially when you have lots

3122
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:00,719
to prefer especially when you have lots
 

3123
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:03,350
to prefer especially when you have lots
of data

3124
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:03,360
of data
 

3125
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,750
of data
and that is

3126
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:05,760
and that is
 

3127
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,390
and that is
what should go in here. I don't know.

3128
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:10,400
what should go in here. I don't know.
 

3129
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,270
what should go in here. I don't know.
Make it learnable. So make this a set of

3130
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:13,280
Make it learnable. So make this a set of
 

3131
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,990
Make it learnable. So make this a set of
learnable parameters called mask.

3132
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,000
learnable parameters called mask.
 

3133
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:36,950
learnable parameters called mask.
Okay.

3134
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:36,960

 

3135
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,110

This is like mask from masking tape

3136
01:18:39,110 --> 01:18:39,120
This is like mask from masking tape
 

3137
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,470
This is like mask from masking tape
where you put like for painting

3138
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:40,480
where you put like for painting
 

3139
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,990
where you put like for painting
something you put masking tape down so

3140
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,000
something you put masking tape down so
 

3141
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,229
something you put masking tape down so
the paint doesn't go there like remove

3142
01:18:44,229 --> 01:18:44,239
the paint doesn't go there like remove
 

3143
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:45,990
the paint doesn't go there like remove
something like it's that that's that's

3144
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:46,000
something like it's that that's that's
 

3145
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,229
something like it's that that's that's
the sense of mask not wearing a mask on

3146
01:18:48,229 --> 01:18:48,239
the sense of mask not wearing a mask on
 

3147
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:49,750
the sense of mask not wearing a mask on
your face mask although I guess that

3148
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:49,760
your face mask although I guess that
 

3149
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,510
your face mask although I guess that
would work too. Okay, but

3150
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
would work too. Okay, but
 

3151
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,149
would work too. Okay, but
this is just a value that says nothing

3152
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,159
this is just a value that says nothing
 

3153
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:59,669
this is just a value that says nothing
here.

3154
01:18:59,669 --> 01:18:59,679

 

3155
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,229

and it's a learn value. So during

3156
01:19:02,229 --> 01:19:02,239
and it's a learn value. So during
 

3157
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,430
and it's a learn value. So during
training, you make sure that you mask

3158
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:05,440
training, you make sure that you mask
 

3159
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,510
training, you make sure that you mask
out lots of values during training so

3160
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,520
out lots of values during training so
 

3161
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,430
out lots of values during training so
you can learn what mask is and then you

3162
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:11,440
you can learn what mask is and then you
 

3163
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,390
you can learn what mask is and then you
have other held out data that's always

3164
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:14,400
have other held out data that's always
 

3165
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,510
have other held out data that's always
masked and you you let it figure out

3166
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:17,520
masked and you you let it figure out
 

3167
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:24,229
masked and you you let it figure out
where it is. Yeah.

3168
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:24,239

 

3169
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,709

>> Ah great question. So this is a

3170
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:26,719
>> Ah great question. So this is a
 

3171
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,750
>> Ah great question. So this is a
learnable vector which means it's a set

3172
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:29,760
learnable vector which means it's a set
 

3173
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,149
learnable vector which means it's a set
of parameters. What's the loss? Whatever

3174
01:19:32,149 --> 01:19:32,159
of parameters. What's the loss? Whatever
 

3175
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:35,110
of parameters. What's the loss? Whatever
loss you have during training.

3176
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:35,120
loss you have during training.
 

3177
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,470
loss you have during training.
So if it's a node level problem,

3178
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:38,480
So if it's a node level problem,
 

3179
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,870
So if it's a node level problem,
right? If it's a node level problem, you

3180
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:40,880
right? If it's a node level problem, you
 

3181
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,229
right? If it's a node level problem, you
might have a node level prediction

3182
01:19:42,229 --> 01:19:42,239
might have a node level prediction
 

3183
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,630
might have a node level prediction
problem.

3184
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:44,640
problem.
 

3185
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,070
problem.
Okay? So in a a a node that has been

3186
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:48,080
Okay? So in a a a node that has been
 

3187
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,750
Okay? So in a a a node that has been
masked

3188
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:49,760
masked
 

3189
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,110
masked
on purpose during training will still

3190
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:53,120
on purpose during training will still
 

3191
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,510
on purpose during training will still
have its loss

3192
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:55,520
have its loss
 

3193
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,669
have its loss
during training.

3194
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:57,679
during training.
 

3195
01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:58,950
during training.
Okay, so everyone see the value like

3196
01:19:58,950 --> 01:19:58,960
Okay, so everyone see the value like
 

3197
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,229
Okay, so everyone see the value like
this is telling it look when you see

3198
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,239
this is telling it look when you see
 

3199
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:03,110
this is telling it look when you see
mask figure out what should go here.

3200
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:03,120
mask figure out what should go here.
 

3201
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,750
mask figure out what should go here.
Okay, now a node that is actually being

3202
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
Okay, now a node that is actually being
 

3203
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,990
Okay, now a node that is actually being
held out is going to be masked but will

3204
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:08,000
held out is going to be masked but will
 

3205
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,110
held out is going to be masked but will
have no associated loss during training.

3206
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:11,120
have no associated loss during training.
 

3207
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,430
have no associated loss during training.
it will just be masked

3208
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:13,440
it will just be masked
 

3209
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,110
it will just be masked
but there'll be no node level

3210
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:15,120
but there'll be no node level
 

3211
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,350
but there'll be no node level
supervision telling it for an output.

3212
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:17,360
supervision telling it for an output.
 

3213
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,950
supervision telling it for an output.
the way you held out data. Way you hold

3214
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:18,960
the way you held out data. Way you hold
 

3215
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,229
the way you held out data. Way you hold
out data. You don't have any training

3216
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:20,239
out data. You don't have any training
 

3217
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:23,270
out data. You don't have any training
loss associated with held out data.

3218
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:23,280
loss associated with held out data.
 

3219
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,590
loss associated with held out data.
But additional things that we mask so

3220
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:25,600
But additional things that we mask so
 

3221
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,910
But additional things that we mask so
that we can learn what masks should mean

3222
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:27,920
that we can learn what masks should mean
 

3223
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,990
that we can learn what masks should mean
during training is an augmentation of

3224
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,000
during training is an augmentation of
 

3225
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,870
during training is an augmentation of
adding of masking data that is done that

3226
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:32,880
adding of masking data that is done that
 

3227
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,149
adding of masking data that is done that
has a loss.

3228
01:20:36,149 --> 01:20:36,159
has a loss.
 

3229
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:40,149
has a loss.
Okay, great. Okay, so that's all I

3230
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:40,159
Okay, great. Okay, so that's all I
 

3231
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:43,110
Okay, great. Okay, so that's all I
wanted to do about uh

3232
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,120
wanted to do about uh
 

3233
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,590
wanted to do about uh
uh GNN's. I have five minutes. I will

3234
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:45,600
uh GNN's. I have five minutes. I will
 

3235
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,149
uh GNN's. I have five minutes. I will
introduce some RNN's stuff and then I

3236
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:50,159
introduce some RNN's stuff and then I
 

3237
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:53,270
introduce some RNN's stuff and then I
will continue this uh the next lecture

3238
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:53,280
will continue this uh the next lecture
 

3239
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,390
will continue this uh the next lecture
but okay so RNN's are a very interesting

3240
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:56,400
but okay so RNN's are a very interesting
 

3241
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,950
but okay so RNN's are a very interesting
story so you might ask why is there no

3242
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:58,960
story so you might ask why is there no
 

3243
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,990
story so you might ask why is there no
section in prince about RNN's like I we

3244
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,000
section in prince about RNN's like I we
 

3245
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,350
section in prince about RNN's like I we
we chose the prince book after looking

3246
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:03,360
we chose the prince book after looking
 

3247
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,709
we chose the prince book after looking
at all the deep learning books we could

3248
01:21:04,709 --> 01:21:04,719
at all the deep learning books we could
 

3249
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:06,550
at all the deep learning books we could
see and we thought that was the best one

3250
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:06,560
see and we thought that was the best one
 

3251
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,790
see and we thought that was the best one
to recommend to you guys to read except

it has one shortcoming it doesn't have

3254
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:10,480
it has one shortcoming it doesn't have
 

3255
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,950
it has one shortcoming it doesn't have
RNN's so for this a little bit of

3256
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:12,960
RNN's so for this a little bit of
 

3257
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,430
RNN's so for this a little bit of
history is useful

3258
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:15,440
history is useful
 

3259
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,229
history is useful
So before 2018 there was a consensus

3260
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:18,239
So before 2018 there was a consensus
 

3261
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,709
So before 2018 there was a consensus
view in the community that there's two

3262
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:20,719
view in the community that there's two
 

3263
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,510
view in the community that there's two
big successes in deep neural networks.

3264
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:23,520
big successes in deep neural networks.
 

3265
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,270
big successes in deep neural networks.
Images in vision using CNN's and

3266
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,280
Images in vision using CNN's and
 

3267
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,950
Images in vision using CNN's and
language and speech using RNNs. RNNs are

3268
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
language and speech using RNNs. RNNs are
 

3269
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,030
language and speech using RNNs. RNNs are
recurrent neural nets.

3270
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,040

 

3271
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,950

In 2017

3272
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:36,960
In 2017
 

3273
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,950
In 2017
the attention is all you need paper came

3274
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:38,960
the attention is all you need paper came
 

3275
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,189
the attention is all you need paper came
out and transformers were introduced.

3276
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:41,199
out and transformers were introduced.
 

3277
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:44,070
out and transformers were introduced.
And what happened was that transformer

3278
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,080
And what happened was that transformer
 

3279
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,990
And what happened was that transformer
architectures introduced originally in

3280
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,000
architectures introduced originally in
 

3281
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,950
architectures introduced originally in
the context of language and then moving

3282
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:48,960
the context of language and then moving
 

3283
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,910
the context of language and then moving
into speech uh slowly consumed

3284
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:53,920
into speech uh slowly consumed
 

3285
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,550
into speech uh slowly consumed
all of the success stories that used to

3286
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:56,560
all of the success stories that used to
 

3287
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,910
all of the success stories that used to
be success stories of R&M. And so there

3288
01:21:59,910 --> 01:21:59,920
be success stories of R&M. And so there
 

3289
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:05,030
be success stories of R&M. And so there
was a time let's say

3290
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,040

 

3291
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,790

3292
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:08,800
the year before last okay
 

3293
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,270
the year before last okay
at which point many people thought that

3294
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:11,280
at which point many people thought that
 

3295
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,669
at which point many people thought that
okay this was these are just uh

3296
01:22:13,669 --> 01:22:13,679
okay this was these are just uh
 

3297
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,830
okay this was these are just uh
consigned to the dust bin of history

3298
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:15,840
consigned to the dust bin of history
 

3299
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,070
consigned to the dust bin of history

3301
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,310
right they exist for maybe historical

01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,510
purposes but no one needs to know them.
A small group of people kept working on

3304
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:23,520
A small group of people kept working on
 

3305
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,510
A small group of people kept working on
this direction and now if you look as I

3306
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:27,520
this direction and now if you look as I
 

3307
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,910
this direction and now if you look as I
mentioned before the latest Quen and the

3308
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:31,920
mentioned before the latest Quen and the
 

3309
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,629
mentioned before the latest Quen and the
IBM uh foundation model both are open

3310
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:34,639
IBM uh foundation model both are open
 

3311
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:37,430
IBM uh foundation model both are open
source and visibly have evidence of

3312
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:37,440
source and visibly have evidence of
 

3313
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,830
source and visibly have evidence of
ideas growing out of here in the new

3314
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:39,840
ideas growing out of here in the new
 

3315
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,870
ideas growing out of here in the new
models. So

3316
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:42,880
models. So
 

3317
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,870
models. So
you we can't count them out. But the

3318
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:44,880
you we can't count them out. But the
 

3319
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,310
you we can't count them out. But the
Prince book was written with the idea

3320
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:46,320
Prince book was written with the idea
 

3321
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,669
Prince book was written with the idea
that okay we're just going to count this

3322
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:47,679
that okay we're just going to count this
 

3323
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:49,430
that okay we're just going to count this
out. We have to make choices that's out.

3324
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:49,440
out. We have to make choices that's out.
 

3325
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,590
out. We have to make choices that's out.
That's why. Okay. So, what's the big

3326
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:53,600
That's why. Okay. So, what's the big
 

3327
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,229
That's why. Okay. So, what's the big
picture here?

3328
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:56,239
picture here?
 

3329
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,990
picture here?
The big picture is we've generalized

3330
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:00,000
The big picture is we've generalized
 

3331
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,870
The big picture is we've generalized
CNN's to graph neural nets to any graph

3332
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:02,880
CNN's to graph neural nets to any graph
 

3333
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,550
CNN's to graph neural nets to any graph
topology.

3334
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,560
topology.
 

3335
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,110
topology.
But that doesn't mean that you just

3336
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:07,120
But that doesn't mean that you just
 

3337
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,189
But that doesn't mean that you just
treat all images as though they're

3338
01:23:09,189 --> 01:23:09,199
treat all images as though they're
 

3339
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:11,030
treat all images as though they're
graphs,

3340
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:11,040
graphs,
 

3341
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,189
graphs,
right? You taking advantage of images is

3342
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:13,199
right? You taking advantage of images is
 

3343
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,310
right? You taking advantage of images is
still useful. So the key issue in

3344
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
still useful. So the key issue in
 

3345
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,629
still useful. So the key issue in
language and speech along with control

3346
01:23:18,629 --> 01:23:18,639
language and speech along with control
 

3347
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:21,910
language and speech along with control
and time series data is that they're

3348
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:21,920
and time series data is that they're
 

3349
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,669
and time series data is that they're
sequential.

3350
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:23,679
sequential.
 

3351
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,669
sequential.
You can there's like a one-dimensional

3352
01:23:25,669 --> 01:23:25,679
You can there's like a one-dimensional
 

3353
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,590
You can there's like a one-dimensional
topology associated with it that has

3354
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:27,600
topology associated with it that has
 

3355
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,750
topology associated with it that has
ordering

3356
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:29,760
ordering
 

3357
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,950
ordering
and also has a natural causal dimension.

3358
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:34,960
and also has a natural causal dimension.
 

3359
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,270
and also has a natural causal dimension.
Stuff language kind of is a little weak

3360
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:37,280
Stuff language kind of is a little weak
 

3361
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,270
Stuff language kind of is a little weak
on the causality but still kind is still

3362
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:39,280
on the causality but still kind is still
 

3363
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:43,510
on the causality but still kind is still
definitely there. But stuff in the past

3364
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:43,520
definitely there. But stuff in the past
 

3365
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,350
definitely there. But stuff in the past
has a different relationship to the

3366
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:45,360
has a different relationship to the
 

3367
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,870
has a different relationship to the
present than the future.

3368
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:48,880
present than the future.
 

3369
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,629
present than the future.
Okay? Because we're embedded in time.

3370
01:23:50,629 --> 01:23:50,639
Okay? Because we're embedded in time.
 

3371
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,510
Okay? Because we're embedded in time.
Time is very special.

3372
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:53,520
Time is very special.
 

3373
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:57,910
Time is very special.
So RNN's were saying R CNN's are like

3374
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:57,920
So RNN's were saying R CNN's are like
 

3375
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,550
So RNN's were saying R CNN's are like
fundamentally about space

3376
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:00,560
fundamentally about space
 

3377
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,229
fundamentally about space
and RNN's are fundamentally about time

3378
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:04,239
and RNN's are fundamentally about time
 

3379
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,950
and RNN's are fundamentally about time
is a way of thinking about it. So from a

3380
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:06,960
is a way of thinking about it. So from a
 

3381
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,629
is a way of thinking about it. So from a
signal processing perspective

3382
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:10,639
signal processing perspective
 

3383
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:13,990
signal processing perspective
you can think of it like this

3384
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:14,000
you can think of it like this
 

3385
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,470
you can think of it like this
in signal processing there's two major

3386
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:18,480
in signal processing there's two major
 

3387
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:21,750
in signal processing there's two major
families of filters that one can use

3388
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:21,760
families of filters that one can use
 

3389
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,229
families of filters that one can use
there's fir filters finite impulse

3390
01:24:24,229 --> 01:24:24,239
there's fir filters finite impulse
 

3391
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:27,189
there's fir filters finite impulse
response filters to which the neural net

3392
01:24:27,189 --> 01:24:27,199
response filters to which the neural net
 

3393
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:30,310
response filters to which the neural net
counterpart is CNN

3394
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:30,320
counterpart is CNN
 

3395
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,910
counterpart is CNN
and this has corresponds to weight

3396
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:31,920
and this has corresponds to weight
 

3397
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:35,189
and this has corresponds to weight
sharing across space

3398
01:24:35,189 --> 01:24:35,199
sharing across space
 

3399
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:37,430
sharing across space
and There are also infinite impulse

3400
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:37,440
and There are also infinite impulse
 

3401
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,510
and There are also infinite impulse
response filters

3402
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:39,520
response filters
 

3403
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,030
response filters
in signal processing which despite the

3404
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:43,040
in signal processing which despite the
 

3405
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,709
in signal processing which despite the
word infinity still have a finite

3406
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:44,719
word infinity still have a finite
 

3407
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,709
word infinity still have a finite
characterization except that finite

3408
01:24:46,709 --> 01:24:46,719
characterization except that finite
 

3409
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:48,790
characterization except that finite
characterization is in terms of a finite

3410
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:48,800
characterization is in terms of a finite
 

3411
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,910
characterization is in terms of a finite
dimensional hidden state.

3412
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:51,920
dimensional hidden state.
 

3413
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,590
dimensional hidden state.
Okay.

3414
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:53,600
Okay.
 

3415
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,750
Okay.
And these filters their counterpart in

3416
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:57,760
And these filters their counterpart in
 

3417
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,629
And these filters their counterpart in
neural nets are RNNs and the weight

3418
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:00,639
neural nets are RNNs and the weight
 

3419
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:03,510
neural nets are RNNs and the weight
sharing is done across time. So that's

3420
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:03,520
sharing is done across time. So that's
 

3421
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,750
sharing is done across time. So that's
the big picture of what's going on and

3422
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:07,760
the big picture of what's going on and
 

3423
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,149
the big picture of what's going on and
the approach that we follow in thinking

3424
01:25:10,149 --> 01:25:10,159
the approach that we follow in thinking
 

3425
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,950
the approach that we follow in thinking
about RNN's is we follow all the design

3426
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:12,960
about RNN's is we follow all the design
 

3427
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,950
about RNN's is we follow all the design
ideas and principles we have from CNN's

3428
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:14,960
ideas and principles we have from CNN's
 

3429
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,270
ideas and principles we have from CNN's
to the extent we can and we just replace

3430
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:17,280
to the extent we can and we just replace
 

3431
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:21,590
to the extent we can and we just replace
space with time and enforce causality.

3432
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:21,600
space with time and enforce causality.
 

3433
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,070
space with time and enforce causality.
So it's really RNN's are about causal

3434
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:24,080
So it's really RNN's are about causal
 

3435
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,990
So it's really RNN's are about causal
through time which means you're allowed

3436
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:26,000
through time which means you're allowed
 

3437
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,830
through time which means you're allowed
to depend on the past you shouldn't

3438
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:27,840
to depend on the past you shouldn't
 

3439
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,550
to depend on the past you shouldn't
depend on the future.

3440
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:30,560
depend on the future.
 

3441
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,669
depend on the future.
Okay. And so next time we'll go into

3442
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:33,679
Okay. And so next time we'll go into
 

3443
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,790
Okay. And so next time we'll go into
this in more detail and work it out. The

3444
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:36,800
this in more detail and work it out. The
 

3445
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,189
this in more detail and work it out. The
discussion will have you think as a kind

3446
01:25:39,189 --> 01:25:39,199
discussion will have you think as a kind
 

3447
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:43,430
discussion will have you think as a kind
of a exercise of thinking about backrop

3448
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:43,440
of a exercise of thinking about backrop
 

3449
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,350
of a exercise of thinking about backrop
uh when you backrop across time. So

3450
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:47,360
uh when you backrop across time. So
 

3451
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,590
uh when you backrop across time. So
there'll be a little bit of a review but

3452
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:49,600
there'll be a little bit of a review but
 

3453
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,350
there'll be a little bit of a review but
it's just basically backrop on in the

3454
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,360
it's just basically backrop on in the
 

3455
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,750
it's just basically backrop on in the
discussion for you tomorrow to get you

3456
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:53,760
discussion for you tomorrow to get you
 

3457
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,950
discussion for you tomorrow to get you
ready for this. Okay. So uh I have

3458
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:56,960
ready for this. Okay. So uh I have
 

3459
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,750
ready for this. Okay. So uh I have
office hours now. My office hours are

3460
01:25:59,750 --> 01:25:59,760
office hours now. My office hours are
 

3461
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,310
office hours now. My office hours are
just going to be till 1 because I have a

3462
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:02,320
just going to be till 1 because I have a
 

3463
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,550
just going to be till 1 because I have a
oneoff meeting at 1 that will force me

3464
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:04,560
oneoff meeting at 1 that will force me
 

3465
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:28,229
oneoff meeting at 1 that will force me
to end office hours early.

3466
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:28,239

 

3467
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:30,320

How
