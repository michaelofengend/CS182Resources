just uh people were asking about
 

417
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,150
just uh people were asking about
readings. We I was pointing them out

418
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
readings. We I was pointing them out
 

419
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,949
readings. We I was pointing them out
very earlier. Um but you know there is

420
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
very earlier. Um but you know there is
 

421
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,550
very earlier. Um but you know there is
good treatment in the prince textbook of

422
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
good treatment in the prince textbook of
 

423
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,509
good treatment in the prince textbook of
VAEEs. There is uh decent treatment of

424
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
VAEEs. There is uh decent treatment of
 

425
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,990
VAEEs. There is uh decent treatment of
diffusion although we have will treat

426
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
diffusion although we have will treat
 

427
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,910
diffusion although we have will treat
diffusion in a slightly different way.

428
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
diffusion in a slightly different way.
 

429
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,550
diffusion in a slightly different way.
Um, and there's a little bit of RL, uh,

430
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
Um, and there's a little bit of RL, uh,
 

431
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,310
Um, and there's a little bit of RL, uh,
the type we're talking about in chapter

432
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
the type we're talking about in chapter
 

433
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,310
the type we're talking about in chapter
19.5. There's other parts of RL we're

434
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
19.5. There's other parts of RL we're
 

435
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,350
19.5. There's other parts of RL we're
not talking about in the class. So,

436
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
not talking about in the class. So,
 

437
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,710
not talking about in the class. So,
don't worry about other RL things in

438
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
don't worry about other RL things in
 

439
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,389
don't worry about other RL things in
chapter 19. Um, but there's a lot of

440
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
chapter 19. Um, but there's a lot of
 

441
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,509
chapter 19. Um, but there's a lot of
stuff how we're talking about it. It's

442
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
stuff how we're talking about it. It's
 

443
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,590
stuff how we're talking about it. It's
not in the textbook. But this is these

444
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:27,600
not in the textbook. But this is these
 

445
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,670
not in the textbook. But this is these
are references that you can also use.

probably all of you have read the post.
We got way more responses than we ever

458
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
We got way more responses than we ever
 

459
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,470
We got way more responses than we ever
thought. We thought I thought like five

460
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
thought. We thought I thought like five
 

461
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,389
thought. We thought I thought like five
people would be interested in doing this

462
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
people would be interested in doing this
 

463
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,829
people would be interested in doing this
but so we're going to change the

464
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
but so we're going to change the
 

465
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,350
but so we're going to change the
structure of the assignment a little bit

466
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
structure of the assignment a little bit
 

467
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,110
structure of the assignment a little bit
in light of the fact that there are so

468
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
in light of the fact that there are so
 

469
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,389
in light of the fact that there are so
many people interested in doing it. I

470
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
many people interested in doing it. I
 

471
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,590
many people interested in doing it. I
know some of you said like oh I didn't

472
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
know some of you said like oh I didn't
 

473
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,470
know some of you said like oh I didn't
see this. Can we like do something? So

474
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
see this. Can we like do something? So
 

475
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,470
see this. Can we like do something? So
we're going to change it to have two

476
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
we're going to change it to have two
 

477
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,829
we're going to change it to have two
approaches. So there's going to be

478
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
approaches. So there's going to be
 

479
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,470
approaches. So there's going to be
essentially a blue team and a red team

480
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
essentially a blue team and a red team
 

481
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,110
essentially a blue team and a red team
baseline team where the red team is

482
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
baseline team where the red team is
 

483
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,509
baseline team where the red team is
going to be tasked with doing the making

484
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
going to be tasked with doing the making
 

485
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,069
going to be tasked with doing the making
these websites using only vibe coding.

486
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079
these websites using only vibe coding.
 

487
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,389
these websites using only vibe coding.
You must all all code should be AI

488
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
You must all all code should be AI
 

489
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,509
You must all all code should be AI
generated and that is a baseline. The

490
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
generated and that is a baseline. The
 

491
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,150
generated and that is a baseline. The
blue teams must beat the red team to be

492
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
blue teams must beat the red team to be
 

493
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,509
blue teams must beat the red team to be
able to receive any kind of extra

494
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
able to receive any kind of extra
 

495
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,030
able to receive any kind of extra
credit.

496
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040

497
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,110

Right? So basically this is to make sure

498
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
Right? So basically this is to make sure
 

499
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,030
Right? So basically this is to make sure
that there's some level of high quality

500
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
that there's some level of high quality
 

501
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,190
that there's some level of high quality
submissions that uh that come through as

502
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
submissions that uh that come through as
 

503
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,190
submissions that uh that come through as
well as to give people an opportunity to

504
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
well as to give people an opportunity to
 

505
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,670
well as to give people an opportunity to
have a loweffort way of putting in uh

506
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
have a loweffort way of putting in uh
 

507
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,110
have a loweffort way of putting in uh
something. So for example, the red

508
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
something. So for example, the red
 

509
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,910
something. So for example, the red
teaming will be uh slightly less points.

510
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
teaming will be uh slightly less points.
 

511
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,509
teaming will be uh slightly less points.
Um but blue teams that do not do better

512
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
Um but blue teams that do not do better
 

513
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,949
Um but blue teams that do not do better
than the red teams will receive no

515
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,150

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
I want us to quickly hopefully
 

637
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,430
I want us to quickly hopefully

training. So remember basic story of

640
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
training. So remember basic story of
 

641
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,990
training. So remember basic story of
post training is pre-train a model you

642
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
post training is pre-train a model you
 

643
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,269
post training is pre-train a model you
SFT it for doing some kind of

644
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
SFT it for doing some kind of
 

645
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,110
SFT it for doing some kind of
instruction following which is basically

646
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
instruction following which is basically
 

647
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,710
instruction following which is basically
trying to maximize the probability of

648
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
trying to maximize the probability of
 

649
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,910
trying to maximize the probability of
responses right that's what cross

650
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
responses right that's what cross
 

651
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,910
responses right that's what cross
entropy loss is trying to do um then you

652
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
entropy loss is trying to do um then you
 

653
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,030
entropy loss is trying to do um then you
want to make it better at solving

654
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
want to make it better at solving
 

655
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,790
want to make it better at solving
problems so you have to be willing to

656
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
problems so you have to be willing to
 

657
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,870
problems so you have to be willing to
spend something spend more compute while

658
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
spend something spend more compute while
 

659
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,310
spend something spend more compute while
answering and then you want to train it

660
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
answering and then you want to train it
 

661
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,910
answering and then you want to train it
to be better we introduce the idea of

662
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
to be better we introduce the idea of
 

663
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,509
to be better we introduce the idea of
RLVR

664
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
RLVR
 

665
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,629
RLVR
which is u if you have an autograder for

666
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
which is u if you have an autograder for
 

667
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,230
which is u if you have an autograder for
your problem so you can tell if a

668
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
your problem so you can tell if a
 

669
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,389
your problem so you can tell if a
particular solution is good or not um

670
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
particular solution is good or not um
 

671
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,509
particular solution is good or not um
and can score it how can you use that

672
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
and can score it how can you use that
 

673
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,150
and can score it how can you use that
and we talked about this scaling law

674
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
and we talked about this scaling law
 

675
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,389
and we talked about this scaling law
perspective which I don't want to recap

676
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
perspective which I don't want to recap
 

677
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,389
perspective which I don't want to recap
um and then we kind of used one

678
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
um and then we kind of used one
 

679
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,749
um and then we kind of used one
particular recipe to kind of help you

680
00:15:59,749 --> 00:15:59,759
particular recipe to kind of help you
 

681
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,590
particular recipe to kind of help you
understand the basic ideas that are

682
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,600
understand the basic ideas that are
 

683
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,550
understand the basic ideas that are
needed so this is the scalar RL u recipe

684
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
needed so this is the scalar RL u recipe
 

685
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,310
needed so this is the scalar RL u recipe
which is useful because it connects to

686
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
which is useful because it connects to
 

687
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,150
which is useful because it connects to
stuff that we've taught in class and

688
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
stuff that we've taught in class and
 

689
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,350
stuff that we've taught in class and
helps you understand the different

690
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
helps you understand the different
 

691
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,110
helps you understand the different
components of doing this kind of RL post

692
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,120
components of doing this kind of RL post
 

693
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,389
components of doing this kind of RL post
training so the the key thing in RL post

694
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399

695
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,749
training so the the key thing in RL post
training and there was confusion about

696
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
training and there was confusion about
 

697
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,189

this so I want to make sure everyone get

698
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199
this so I want to make sure everyone get
 

699
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,069
this so I want to make sure everyone get
understands it for for verifiable

700
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
understands it for for verifiable
 

701
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,350

rewards is you you take a problem that

702
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:25,360
rewards is you you take a problem that
 

703
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,430
rewards is you you take a problem that
you know how to autograde and you

704
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
you know how to autograde and you
 

705
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,949
you know how to autograde and you
proceed to ask the model to do many many

706
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
proceed to ask the model to do many many
 

707
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,550
proceed to ask the model to do many many
different generations many many

708
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
different generations many many
 

709
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,629
different generations many many
different attempts to solve that problem

710
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
different attempts to solve that problem
 

711
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,790
different attempts to solve that problem
okay that's what G is these generations

712
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
okay that's what G is these generations
 

713
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,189
okay that's what G is these generations
G

714
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
G
 

715
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,870
G
and then what you want to do your basic

716
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
and then what you want to do your basic
 

717
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,230
and then what you want to do your basic
idea is you want to reward the

718
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
idea is you want to reward the
 

719
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,230
idea is you want to reward the
generations that are good and penalize

720
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
generations that are good and penalize
 

721
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,829
generations that are good and penalize
the ones that are bad to make the model

722
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:47,839
the ones that are bad to make the model
 

723
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,189
the ones that are bad to make the model
more likely to generate good generations

724
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
more likely to generate good generations
 

725
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,069
more likely to generate good generations
in the future. And so as you saw in

726
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
in the future. And so as you saw in
 

727
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,990
in the future. And so as you saw in
homework three, there's this trick that

728
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
homework three, there's this trick that
 

729
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,389
homework three, there's this trick that
you don't have gradients on the reward.

730
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399
you don't have gradients on the reward.
 

731
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,150
you don't have gradients on the reward.
Uh so you instead you do this log

732
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
Uh so you instead you do this log
 

733
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,430
Uh so you instead you do this log
probability uh trick and now you have to

734
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
probability uh trick and now you have to
 

735
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,390
probability uh trick and now you have to
basically put a score in front,

736
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
basically put a score in front,
 

737
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,909
basically put a score in front,
right? So this that's just this thing,

738
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
right? So this that's just this thing,
 

739
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,029
right? So this that's just this thing,
right? So the role of this thing is done

740
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,039
right? So the role of this thing is done
 

741
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,630
right? So the role of this thing is done
by uh this expression and what this

742
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
by uh this expression and what this
 

743
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,510
by uh this expression and what this
expression is doing is it's saying that

744
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
expression is doing is it's saying that
 

745
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,230
expression is doing is it's saying that
we would like to compute how much better

746
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
we would like to compute how much better
 

747
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,909
we would like to compute how much better
this generation is or how much worse

748
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919
this generation is or how much worse
 

749
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,309
this generation is or how much worse
this is in a normalized way relative to

750
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
this is in a normalized way relative to
 

751
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,309
this is in a normalized way relative to
other generations for the problem. So

752
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:26,319
other generations for the problem. So
 

753
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,390
other generations for the problem. So
you remove the mean that way you can

754
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
you remove the mean that way you can
 

755
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,270
you remove the mean that way you can
tell better or worse than the average

756
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
tell better or worse than the average
 

757
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,710
tell better or worse than the average
and you normalize by the standard

758
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
and you normalize by the standard
 

759
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,310
and you normalize by the standard
deviation so that there's on a common

760
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
deviation so that there's on a common
 

761
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,150
deviation so that there's on a common
scale. Okay, that's what this uh a hat

762
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
scale. Okay, that's what this uh a hat
 

763
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,430
scale. Okay, that's what this uh a hat
is. And what you do here is the other

764
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440
is. And what you do here is the other
 

765
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,470
is. And what you do here is the other
thing that was described in this

766
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
thing that was described in this
 

767
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,669
thing that was described in this
perspective and you can there's

768
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
perspective and you can there's
 

769
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,789
perspective and you can there's
different approaches to doing RL VR and

770
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
different approaches to doing RL VR and
 

771
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,310
different approaches to doing RL VR and
many different recipes and they kind of

772
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
many different recipes and they kind of
 

773
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,070
many different recipes and they kind of
vary on different axes. We'll kind of

774
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,080
vary on different axes. We'll kind of
 

775
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,990
vary on different axes. We'll kind of
show you some of those axes just by

776
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
show you some of those axes just by
 

777
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,750
show you some of those axes just by
example. There's an entire class um 185

778
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
example. There's an entire class um 185
 

779
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,230
example. There's an entire class um 185
285 uh which we taught about uh RL per

780
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
285 uh which we taught about uh RL per
 

781
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,390
285 uh which we taught about uh RL per
se and deep learning. So this is just a

782
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
se and deep learning. So this is just a
 

783
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,150
se and deep learning. So this is just a
taste

784
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
taste
 

785
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,990
taste
that what we're doing here is we're

786
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
that what we're doing here is we're
 

787
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,029
that what we're doing here is we're
taking this uh although generation is an

788
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
taking this uh although generation is an
 

789
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,190
taking this uh although generation is an
entire sequence we're going to treat it

790
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
entire sequence we're going to treat it
 

791
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,070
entire sequence we're going to treat it
as a bag of tokens

792
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
as a bag of tokens
 

793
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,070
as a bag of tokens
and every token will inherit the

794
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
and every token will inherit the
 

795
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,070
and every token will inherit the
advantage from its generation. So if the

796
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
advantage from its generation. So if the
 

797
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,830
advantage from its generation. So if the
generation succeed that token is a good

798
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
generation succeed that token is a good
 

799
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,310
generation succeed that token is a good
token if the generation failed that

800
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
token if the generation failed that
 

801
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,310
token if the generation failed that
token is a bad token. You think of it

802
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,320
token is a bad token. You think of it
 

803
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,310
token is a bad token. You think of it
that way and we use the probability kind

804
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
that way and we use the probability kind
 

805
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,070
that way and we use the probability kind
of at the individual token level here

806
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,080
of at the individual token level here
 

807
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,350
of at the individual token level here
and then we have to do some adjustments.

808
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
and then we have to do some adjustments.
 

809
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,669
and then we have to do some adjustments.
Okay, the adjustments are required

810
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
Okay, the adjustments are required
 

811
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,710
Okay, the adjustments are required
because to make this stuff work in

812
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
because to make this stuff work in
 

813
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,029
because to make this stuff work in
practice,

814
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
practice,
 

815
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,310
practice,
you're going to be so problem homework

816
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
you're going to be so problem homework
 

817
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,870
you're going to be so problem homework
three problem that you saw it very much

818
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
three problem that you saw it very much
 

819
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,669
three problem that you saw it very much
relied on the fact that this probability

820
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:51,679
relied on the fact that this probability
 

821
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,270
relied on the fact that this probability
and this probability are the same

822
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
and this probability are the same
 

823
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,789
and this probability are the same
probability. I got questions about this

824
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799
probability. I got questions about this
 

825
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,909
probability. I got questions about this
in office hours. So I want to make sure

826
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
in office hours. So I want to make sure
 

827
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,549
in office hours. So I want to make sure
everyone everyone's clear on it.

828
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
everyone everyone's clear on it.
 

829
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,390
everyone everyone's clear on it.
And you do this trick so that you can

830
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
And you do this trick so that you can
 

831
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,310
And you do this trick so that you can
get what you want, which is a gradient

832
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
get what you want, which is a gradient
 

833
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,390
get what you want, which is a gradient
on this expectation.

834
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400

 

835
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,029

Now the problem is that when you're

836
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
Now the problem is that when you're
 

837
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,510
Now the problem is that when you're
doing this in practice, if you wanted to

838
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
doing this in practice, if you wanted to
 

839
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,510
doing this in practice, if you wanted to
make this distribution and this

840
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:15,520
make this distribution and this
 

841
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,830
make this distribution and this
distribution be the same distribution,

842
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840
distribution be the same distribution,
 

843
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,110
distribution be the same distribution,
you would have to do these things

844
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,120
you would have to do these things
 

845
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,029
you would have to do these things
sequentially.

846
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
sequentially.
 

847
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,789
sequentially.
You would have to use the distribution

848
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
You would have to use the distribution
 

849
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,510
You would have to use the distribution
you have to do to make the generations.

850
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
you have to do to make the generations.
 

851
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,029
you have to do to make the generations.
So you make a bunch of generations using

852
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:27,039
So you make a bunch of generations using
 

853
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,630
So you make a bunch of generations using
this distribution. Then you have to

854
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
this distribution. Then you have to
 

855
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,390
this distribution. Then you have to
autograde these distributions. These

856
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400
autograde these distributions. These
 

857
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,950
autograde these distributions. These
these generations. Now you've computed

858
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:32,960
these generations. Now you've computed
 

859
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,430
these generations. Now you've computed
all this stuff

860
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,440
all this stuff
 

861
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,669
all this stuff
and now you can go ahead and compute

862
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
and now you can go ahead and compute
 

863
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,190
and now you can go ahead and compute
this loss and then do the update.

864
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
this loss and then do the update.
 

865
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,549
this loss and then do the update.
Everyone with me? Do you see this

866
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
Everyone with me? Do you see this
 

867
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,669
Everyone with me? Do you see this
connection, the ordering? But you don't

868
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
connection, the ordering? But you don't
 

869
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,310
connection, the ordering? But you don't
want to do that. You don't want to have

870
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,320
want to do that. You don't want to have
 

871
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,270
want to do that. You don't want to have
the machines that you have available for

872
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
the machines that you have available for
 

873
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,350
the machines that you have available for
doing

874
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:53,360
doing
 

875
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,830
doing
uh the back prop to have to sit and wait

876
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
uh the back prop to have to sit and wait
 

877
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,870
uh the back prop to have to sit and wait
for the generations to happen.

878
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
for the generations to happen.
 

879
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,430
for the generations to happen.
Okay, that's not a good idea to waste

880
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
Okay, that's not a good idea to waste
 

881
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,190
Okay, that's not a good idea to waste
your resources that way. And it turns

882
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
your resources that way. And it turns
 

883
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,510
your resources that way. And it turns
out good code for doing the generation

884
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
out good code for doing the generation
 

885
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,150
out good code for doing the generation
is different than good code for doing

886
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,160
is different than good code for doing
 

887
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,150
is different than good code for doing
back prop because when you're doing the

888
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,160
back prop because when you're doing the
 

889
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,270
back prop because when you're doing the
generation you don't have to store

890
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
generation you don't have to store
 

891
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,110
generation you don't have to store
everything around to be do back prop.

892
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
everything around to be do back prop.
 

893
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,230
everything around to be do back prop.
You just have to have the generation

894
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
You just have to have the generation
 

895
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,070
You just have to have the generation
happen. So there's actually different

896
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,080
happen. So there's actually different
 

897
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,669
happen. So there's actually different
code bases that are used to do the

898
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
code bases that are used to do the
 

899
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,430
code bases that are used to do the
generation and to do the back prop. As a

900
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
generation and to do the back prop. As a
 

901
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,909
generation and to do the back prop. As a
result, there's going to be a difference

902
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:27,919
result, there's going to be a difference
 

903
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,549
result, there's going to be a difference
between the actual probabilities used to

904
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
between the actual probabilities used to
 

905
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,029
between the actual probabilities used to
do the generation and the probabilities

906
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
do the generation and the probabilities
 

907
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,470
do the generation and the probabilities
that are used to do the training. Does

908
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
that are used to do the training. Does
 

909
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,950
that are used to do the training. Does
everyone see this? So, you're not going

910
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
everyone see this? So, you're not going
 

911
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,510
everyone see this? So, you're not going
to be able to have this probability and

912
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
to be able to have this probability and
 

913
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,870
to be able to have this probability and
this probability be the same

914
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
this probability be the same
 

915
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,590
this probability be the same
probability. So, you have to patch this

916
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:45,600
probability. So, you have to patch this
 

917
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,390
probability. So, you have to patch this
problem. And a standard way of patching

918
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
problem. And a standard way of patching
 

919
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,630
problem. And a standard way of patching
this problem is to say whenever you're

920
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
this problem is to say whenever you're
 

921
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,909
this problem is to say whenever you're
generating using a different probability

922
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
generating using a different probability
 

923
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,310
generating using a different probability
adjust with the ratio of the

924
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,320
adjust with the ratio of the
 

925
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,070
adjust with the ratio of the
probabilities. Okay, this is called

926
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
probabilities. Okay, this is called
 

927
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,190
probabilities. Okay, this is called
important sampling where you say oops I

928
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,200
important sampling where you say oops I
 

929
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,710
important sampling where you say oops I
generated with this probability so let

930
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:02,720
generated with this probability so let
 

931
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,230
generated with this probability so let
me divide by it and let me this is the

932
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
me divide by it and let me this is the
 

933
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,669
me divide by it and let me this is the
probability I wanted to generate with

934
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,679
probability I wanted to generate with
 

935
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,789
probability I wanted to generate with
but I didn't. So I compute this ratio

936
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:08,799
but I didn't. So I compute this ratio
 

937
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,390
but I didn't. So I compute this ratio
and I stick it in here but I don't want

938
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
and I stick it in here but I don't want
 

939
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,510
and I stick it in here but I don't want
a gradient on this. So that's why

940
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
a gradient on this. So that's why
 

941
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,510
a gradient on this. So that's why
there's a stop gradient here like don't

942
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
there's a stop gradient here like don't
 

943
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,789
there's a stop gradient here like don't
take gradients on. This is an adjustment

944
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,799
take gradients on. This is an adjustment
 

945
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,950
take gradients on. This is an adjustment
I'm doing.

946
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:16,960
I'm doing.
 

947
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,029
I'm doing.
Okay. Now, I misspoke last time, so I

948
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
Okay. Now, I misspoke last time, so I
 

949
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,149
Okay. Now, I misspoke last time, so I
want to make sure this has been very

950
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
want to make sure this has been very
 

951
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,230
want to make sure this has been very
clear. Um, I fixed it in the notes so

952
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
clear. Um, I fixed it in the notes so
 

953
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,590
clear. Um, I fixed it in the notes so
that if people read the notes, it was

954
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
that if people read the notes, it was
 

955
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,830
that if people read the notes, it was
wasn't there. But what does this minimum

956
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
wasn't there. But what does this minimum
 

957
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,510
wasn't there. But what does this minimum
mean?

958
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
mean?
 

959
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,070
mean?
The minimum means that if this ratio

960
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
The minimum means that if this ratio
 

961
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,149
The minimum means that if this ratio
is too big, which means that

962
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159
is too big, which means that
 

963
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,909
is too big, which means that
there was a helpful question that I uh

964
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919
there was a helpful question that I uh
 

965
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,549
there was a helpful question that I uh
fumbled last time. If this training

966
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
fumbled last time. If this training
 

967
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,950
fumbled last time. If this training
policy that you're actually training and

968
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
policy that you're actually training and
 

969
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,190
policy that you're actually training and
the generation policies have become

970
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
the generation policies have become
 

971
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,789
the generation policies have become
significantly out of sync with each

972
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
significantly out of sync with each
 

973
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,430
significantly out of sync with each
other and have the training policy is

974
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
other and have the training policy is
 

975
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,990
other and have the training policy is
assigning a very large probability to

976
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
assigning a very large probability to
 

977
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,870
assigning a very large probability to
this relative to the generation pro uh

978
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
this relative to the generation pro uh
 

979
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,190
this relative to the generation pro uh
probability. Now think about it that

980
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
probability. Now think about it that
 

981
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,950
probability. Now think about it that
these are ratios of numbers between zero

982
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
these are ratios of numbers between zero
 

983
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,830
these are ratios of numbers between zero
and one. The only way that's getting big

984
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
and one. The only way that's getting big
 

985
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,110
and one. The only way that's getting big
is if the denominator is getting small.

986
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
is if the denominator is getting small.
 

987
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,630
is if the denominator is getting small.
Everyone see that? like you're not you

988
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
Everyone see that? like you're not you
 

989
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,190
Everyone see that? like you're not you
see there's not like a you can't really

990
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
see there's not like a you can't really
 

991
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,870
see there's not like a you can't really
go that high. So the only way to get big

992
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880
go that high. So the only way to get big
 

993
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,350
go that high. So the only way to get big
is the denominator gets small. And so

994
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
is the denominator gets small. And so
 

995
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,190
is the denominator gets small. And so
from a practical perspective this is

996
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,200
from a practical perspective this is
 

997
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,990
from a practical perspective this is
important when you're doing like long uh

998
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,000
important when you're doing like long uh
 

999
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,029
important when you're doing like long uh
training runs because the probability

1000
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:21,039
training runs because the probability
 

1001
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,549
training runs because the probability
that something was generated with very

1002
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:22,559
that something was generated with very
 

1003
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,750
that something was generated with very
low probability is also low.

1004
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:25,760
low probability is also low.
 

1005
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,789
low probability is also low.
Okay, but it can happen. So if that were

1006
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
Okay, but it can happen. So if that were
 

1007
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,510
Okay, but it can happen. So if that were
to happen, cap it at epsilon.

1008
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,520
to happen, cap it at epsilon.
 

1009
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,149
to happen, cap it at epsilon.
Don't let it get beyond a certain point.

1010
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,159
Don't let it get beyond a certain point.
 

1011
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,230
Don't let it get beyond a certain point.
Um otherwise go ahead and use it to

1012
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
Um otherwise go ahead and use it to
 

1013
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,830
Um otherwise go ahead and use it to
adjust the probabilities as you need to.

1014
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
adjust the probabilities as you need to.
 

1015
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,590
adjust the probabilities as you need to.
Okay.

1016
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
Okay.
 

1017
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,190
Okay.
So what's going on is you do this for

1018
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
So what's going on is you do this for
 

1019
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,029
So what's going on is you do this for
doing the generations and of course as

1020
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039
doing the generations and of course as
 

1021
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,990
doing the generations and of course as
soon as you have done uh

1022
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
soon as you have done uh
 

1023
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,149
soon as you have done uh
an update. So you apply updates as soon

1024
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
an update. So you apply updates as soon
 

1025
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,230
an update. So you apply updates as soon
as you can apply an update you can send

1026
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
as you can apply an update you can send
 

1027
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,430
as you can apply an update you can send
that updated set of parameters back to

1028
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,440
that updated set of parameters back to
 

1029
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,510
that updated set of parameters back to
whatever servers are doing the

1030
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:01,520
whatever servers are doing the
 

1031
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,750
whatever servers are doing the
generations.

1032
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:03,760
generations.
 

1033
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,470
generations.
Everyone with me? So you have to send

1034
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
Everyone with me? So you have to send
 

1035
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,750
Everyone with me? So you have to send
that update over.

1036
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
that update over.
 

1037
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,870
that update over.
And so this generation basically tracks

1038
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:12,880
And so this generation basically tracks
 

1039
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,909
And so this generation basically tracks
the training with a lag of some kind.

1040
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:17,919
the training with a lag of some kind.
 

1041
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,110
the training with a lag of some kind.
And now there's all if you read the

1042
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
And now there's all if you read the
 

1043
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,470
And now there's all if you read the
paper, there's all kinds of interesting

1044
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480
paper, there's all kinds of interesting
 

1045
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,070
paper, there's all kinds of interesting
tricks that are referenced in that paper

1046
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
tricks that are referenced in that paper
 

1047
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,149
tricks that are referenced in that paper
to kind of get this to go faster. And

1048
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:24,159
to kind of get this to go faster. And
 

1049
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,669
to kind of get this to go faster. And
one of them is even what's called

1050
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
one of them is even what's called
 

1051
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,230
one of them is even what's called
in-flight updates. So inflight update

1052
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,240
in-flight updates. So inflight update
 

1053
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,590
in-flight updates. So inflight update
means while the generator is generating

1054
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
means while the generator is generating
 

1055
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,070
means while the generator is generating
okay so it's generating a generation

1056
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
okay so it's generating a generation
 

1057
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,870
okay so it's generating a generation
it'll be like okay now a new model and

1058
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
it'll be like okay now a new model and
 

1059
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,870
it'll be like okay now a new model and
it'll keep generating

1060
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
it'll keep generating
 

1061
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,630
it'll keep generating
but think about it when you do a

1062
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:40,640
but think about it when you do a
 

1063
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,070
but think about it when you do a
everyone see what hear what I'm talking

1064
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
everyone see what hear what I'm talking
 

1065
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,350
everyone see what hear what I'm talking
about like you're you're generating and

1066
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,360
about like you're you're generating and
 

1067
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,430
about like you're you're generating and
this response isn't coming from one

1068
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
this response isn't coming from one
 

1069
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,230
this response isn't coming from one
model it's coming from model switched

1070
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
model it's coming from model switched
 

1071
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,390
model it's coming from model switched
different model so if you're going to do

1072
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
different model so if you're going to do
 

1073
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,390
different model so if you're going to do
this correctly you would go back and

1074
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
this correctly you would go back and
 

1075
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,149
this correctly you would go back and
recomputee all the keys and values under

1076
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
recomputee all the keys and values under
 

1077
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,510
recomputee all the keys and values under
the new model, but that involves work.

1078
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
the new model, but that involves work.
 

1079
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,990
the new model, but that involves work.
So you say whatever and you just keep

1080
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
So you say whatever and you just keep
 

1081
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,190
So you say whatever and you just keep
going. So people do tricks like this to

1082
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
going. So people do tricks like this to
 

1083
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,510
going. So people do tricks like this to
use scale key values from a different

1084
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,520
use scale key values from a different
 

1085
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,070
use scale key values from a different
model to generate under a new model and

1086
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,080
model to generate under a new model and
 

1087
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,950
model to generate under a new model and
just for the speed and it's worth it.

1088
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
just for the speed and it's worth it.
 

1089
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,470
just for the speed and it's worth it.
Okay, so that's what the scale RL paper

1090
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
Okay, so that's what the scale RL paper
 

1091
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,230
Okay, so that's what the scale RL paper
talks about. Lots of tricks involved in

1092
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:16,240
talks about. Lots of tricks involved in
 

1093
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,470
talks about. Lots of tricks involved in
making this stuff work um in practice,

1094
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
making this stuff work um in practice,
 

1095
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,590
making this stuff work um in practice,
but you now have all of the sort of

1096
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
but you now have all of the sort of
 

1097
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,390
but you now have all of the sort of
ingredients understood for understanding

1098
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
ingredients understood for understanding
 

1099
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,750
ingredients understood for understanding
what's happening here. And that was the

1100
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:25,760
what's happening here. And that was the
 

1101
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,269
what's happening here. And that was the
point of last lecture.

1102
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,279
point of last lecture.
 

1103
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,510
point of last lecture.
>> Yes.

1104
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520

1108
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320

1109
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,070
probabilities.
>> So P theta is just the generation

00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
>> So P theta is just the generation
 

1111
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,549

probabilities here. So remember in in

1112
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:44,559
probabilities here. So remember in in
 

1113
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,310
probabilities here. So remember in in
the homework three what you had was you

1114
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,320
the homework three what you had was you
 

1115
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,789
the homework three what you had was you
had a model that would generate outputs

1116
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:48,799
had a model that would generate outputs
 

1117
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,470
had a model that would generate outputs
with some probability and you could

1118
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:50,480
with some probability and you could
 

1119
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,269
with some probability and you could
score them in a non-ifferiable way.

1120
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
score them in a non-ifferiable way.
 

1121
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,110
score them in a non-ifferiable way.
So you want to still get a gradient that

1122
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,120
So you want to still get a gradient that
 

1123
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,230
So you want to still get a gradient that
you need to be update those

1124
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
you need to be update those
 

1125
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,830
you need to be update those
probabilities by updating the model

1126
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840
probabilities by updating the model
 

1127
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,909
probabilities by updating the model
that's updating with parameters theta

1128
00:24:59,909 --> 00:24:59,919
that's updating with parameters theta
 

1129
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,430
that's updating with parameters theta
right the model has parameters theta

1130
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
right the model has parameters theta
 

1131
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,390
right the model has parameters theta
it's generating something with

1132
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,400
it's generating something with
 

1133
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,750
it's generating something with
probabilities so this is a way to do it

1134
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
probabilities so this is a way to do it
 

1135
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,430
probabilities so this is a way to do it
so p theta is just the model in this

1136
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
so p theta is just the model in this
 

1137
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,310
so p theta is just the model in this
picture the engineering issue is that

1138
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
picture the engineering issue is that
 

1139
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,789
picture the engineering issue is that
there isn't one model the engineering

1140
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
there isn't one model the engineering
 

1141
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,549
there isn't one model the engineering
issue is you have a generating model and

1142
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:16,559
issue is you have a generating model and
 

1143
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,750
issue is you have a generating model and
a training model

1144
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:19,760
a training model
 

1145
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,990
a training model
in practice so you have to deal with the

1146
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,000
in practice so you have to deal with the
 

1147
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,070
in practice so you have to deal with the
fact that there's is a discrepancy and

1148
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,080
fact that there's is a discrepancy and
 

1149
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,669
fact that there's is a discrepancy and
this discrepancy is important to deal

1150
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
this discrepancy is important to deal
 

1151
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,510
this discrepancy is important to deal
with. If you don't do these kinds of

1152
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,520
with. If you don't do these kinds of
 

1153
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,029
with. If you don't do these kinds of
tricks, uh the training goes bad.

1154
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:33,039

 

1155
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,750

The imbalances uh effect affects the

1156
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
The imbalances uh effect affects the
 

1157
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,230
The imbalances uh effect affects the
actual quality of the training.

1158
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:38,240
actual quality of the training.
 

1159
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,750
actual quality of the training.
Okay.

1160
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
Okay.
 

1161
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,990
Okay.
So this we talked about before last

1162
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
So this we talked about before last
 

1163
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,269
So this we talked about before last
time. So now continuing

1164
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279
time. So now continuing
 

1165
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,789
time. So now continuing
there's one thing I want to talk about

1166
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:46,799
there's one thing I want to talk about
 

1167
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,510
there's one thing I want to talk about
which is this particular paper. or the

1168
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:49,520
which is this particular paper. or the
 

1169
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,549
which is this particular paper. or the
SCARL RL paper says that they find for

1170
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
SCARL RL paper says that they find for
 

1171
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,870
SCARL RL paper says that they find for
the LM context that they're talking

1172
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:54,880
the LM context that they're talking
 

1173
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,029
the LM context that they're talking
about that this is the recipe that they

1174
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
about that this is the recipe that they
 

1175
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,750
about that this is the recipe that they
think works the best and they're basing

1176
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
think works the best and they're basing
 

1177
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,029
think works the best and they're basing
this on uh findings at scale from this

1178
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,039
this on uh findings at scale from this
 

1179
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,510
this on uh findings at scale from this
team out of China who made the Minimax

1180
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:05,520
team out of China who made the Minimax
 

1181
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,110
team out of China who made the Minimax
model which proposed something pretty

1182
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
model which proposed something pretty
 

1183
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,630
model which proposed something pretty
much similar. They just did some

1184
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
much similar. They just did some
 

1185
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,950
much similar. They just did some
engineering updates on Minimax. Not

1186
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
engineering updates on Minimax. Not
 

1187
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,149
engineering updates on Minimax. Not
really that any conceptual updates. Uh

1188
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:14,159
really that any conceptual updates. Uh
 

1189
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,269
really that any conceptual updates. Uh
but there's many many many uh such um

1190
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
but there's many many many uh such um
 

1191
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,549
but there's many many many uh such um
RLVR recipes out there. I'm sure you

1192
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:20,559
RLVR recipes out there. I'm sure you
 

1193
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,830
RLVR recipes out there. I'm sure you
know before the year is out there will

1194
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:23,840
know before the year is out there will
 

1195
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,510
know before the year is out there will
probably be an updated version that

1196
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:25,520
probably be an updated version that
 

1197
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,870
probably be an updated version that
someone who says, "Oh, here's a tweak

1198
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
someone who says, "Oh, here's a tweak
 

1199
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,710
someone who says, "Oh, here's a tweak
that does a little bit better than

1200
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
that does a little bit better than
 

1201
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,430
that does a little bit better than
this." Lots of tweaks keep happening and

1202
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,440
this." Lots of tweaks keep happening and
 

1203
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,750
this." Lots of tweaks keep happening and
many people believe many of them are not

1204
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
many people believe many of them are not
 

1205
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,710
many people believe many of them are not
public. So public ones keep coming up

1206
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:36,720
public. So public ones keep coming up
 

1207
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,070
public. So public ones keep coming up
also.

1208
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
also.
 

1209
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,750
also.
So

1210
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:39,760
So
 

1211
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,510
So
there's another thing that is al also

1212
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,520
there's another thing that is al also
 

1213
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,909
there's another thing that is al also
done in these problems and that is just

1214
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
done in these problems and that is just
 

1215
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,070
done in these problems and that is just
as we saw in VAE where we added an

1216
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080
as we saw in VAE where we added an
 

1217
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,470
as we saw in VAE where we added an
auxiliary loss involving KL in these

1218
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:50,480
auxiliary loss involving KL in these
 

1219
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,789
auxiliary loss involving KL in these
kinds of RL problems they often use KL

1220
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
kinds of RL problems they often use KL
 

1221
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,950
kinds of RL problems they often use KL
regularization with respect to some

1222
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:54,960
regularization with respect to some
 

1223
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,990
regularization with respect to some
reference policy pyreff

1224
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,000
reference policy pyreff
 

1225
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,390
reference policy pyreff
so there's a very basic kind of approach

1226
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
so there's a very basic kind of approach
 

1227
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,110
so there's a very basic kind of approach
to thinking about this so RL people so

1228
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
to thinking about this so RL people so
 

1229
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,070
to thinking about this so RL people so
in machine learning learning generally

1230
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,080
in machine learning learning generally
 

1231
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,710
in machine learning learning generally
we think about minimizing losses okay so

1232
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:10,720
we think about minimizing losses okay so
 

1233
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,149
we think about minimizing losses okay so
we think about some loss when I minimize

1234
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:12,159
we think about some loss when I minimize
 

1235
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,909
we think about some loss when I minimize
it RL people often think about

1236
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
it RL people often think about
 

1237
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,470
it RL people often think about
maximizing a reward

1238
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
maximizing a reward
 

1239
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,750
maximizing a reward
it's just negative signs um difference

1240
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:21,760
it's just negative signs um difference
 

1241
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,710
it's just negative signs um difference
about them but so following the RL

1242
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
about them but so following the RL
 

1243
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,029
about them but so following the RL
perspective they think about as arg max

1244
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,039
perspective they think about as arg max
 

1245
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,350
perspective they think about as arg max
I want to find the best policy that

1246
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
I want to find the best policy that
 

1247
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,110
I want to find the best policy that
maximizes

1248
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,120
maximizes
 

1249
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,630
maximizes
the expectation if I generate

1250
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,640
the expectation if I generate
 

1251
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,390
the expectation if I generate
uh the responses. So X is the prompt.

1252
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:38,400
uh the responses. So X is the prompt.
 

1253
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,190
uh the responses. So X is the prompt.
Think of X as prompts and Y is the uh

1254
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200
Think of X as prompts and Y is the uh
 

1255
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,590
Think of X as prompts and Y is the uh
response. So I generate the Y response

1256
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:43,600
response. So I generate the Y response
 

1257
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,310
response. So I generate the Y response
under this policy. I want to maximize

1258
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,320
under this policy. I want to maximize
 

1259
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,549
under this policy. I want to maximize
the expected reward.

1260
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:48,559
the expected reward.
 

1261
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,350
the expected reward.
Suppose I had a reward. Now in an RLVR

1262
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:51,360
Suppose I had a reward. Now in an RLVR
 

1263
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,190
Suppose I had a reward. Now in an RLVR
con uh context, this would be something

1264
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,200
con uh context, this would be something
 

1265
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,630
con uh context, this would be something
that you could just directly evaluate.

1266
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
that you could just directly evaluate.
 

1267
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,430
that you could just directly evaluate.
Okay. But in a other con in other

1268
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,440
Okay. But in a other con in other
 

1269
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,710
Okay. But in a other con in other
context, this might be you have a model

1270
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
context, this might be you have a model
 

1271
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,190
context, this might be you have a model
for the reward that you have to train to

1272
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,200
for the reward that you have to train to
 

1273
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,710
for the reward that you have to train to
also learn separately. However it is,

1274
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,720
also learn separately. However it is,
 

1275
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,269
also learn separately. However it is,
you have a reward. So if you just do

1276
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:07,279
you have a reward. So if you just do
 

1277
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,590
you have a reward. So if you just do
this, you get something. But if you add

1278
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
this, you get something. But if you add
 

1279
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,029
this, you get something. But if you add
a regularizer, so in

1280
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,039
a regularizer, so in
 

1281
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,750
a regularizer, so in
in classic ML, we add regularizers with

1282
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
in classic ML, we add regularizers with
 

1283
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,669
in classic ML, we add regularizers with
positive signs. They're added things to

1284
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679
positive signs. They're added things to
 

1285
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,830
positive signs. They're added things to
the loss. But when you're maximizing a

1286
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
the loss. But when you're maximizing a
 

1287
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,230
the loss. But when you're maximizing a
reward, the regularizer term shows up

1288
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
reward, the regularizer term shows up
 

1289
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,789
reward, the regularizer term shows up
with a negative sign.

1290
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:24,799
with a negative sign.
 

1291
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,710
with a negative sign.
Okay? You think of like a cost function,

1292
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:26,720
Okay? You think of like a cost function,
 

1293
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,110
Okay? You think of like a cost function,
right? The kale divergence. So this says

1294
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,120
right? The kale divergence. So this says
 

1295
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,070
right? The kale divergence. So this says
you put some weight on the regularizing

1296
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,080
you put some weight on the regularizing
 

1297
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,590
you put some weight on the regularizing
term and you penalize the KL divergence

1298
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:37,600
term and you penalize the KL divergence
 

1299
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,590
term and you penalize the KL divergence
between the thing that you're maximizing

1300
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:41,600
between the thing that you're maximizing
 

1301
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,590
between the thing that you're maximizing
and some reference policy.

1302
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,600
and some reference policy.
 

1303
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,029
and some reference policy.
What is this saying? This is saying that

1304
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:49,039
What is this saying? This is saying that
 

1305
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,149
What is this saying? This is saying that
you want to tell the the training

1306
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
you want to tell the the training
 

1307
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,590
you want to tell the the training
approach to not move too far from this

1308
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
approach to not move too far from this
 

1309
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,310
approach to not move too far from this
reference policy. try to stay close to

1310
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:58,320
reference policy. try to stay close to
 

1311
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,750
reference policy. try to stay close to
the reference policy to the extent you

1312
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
the reference policy to the extent you
 

1313
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,669
the reference policy to the extent you
can. That's what a regularizer like this

1314
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
can. That's what a regularizer like this
 

1315
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,269
can. That's what a regularizer like this
is doing. So many RL training recipes

1316
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:05,279
is doing. So many RL training recipes
 

1317
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,909
is doing. So many RL training recipes
involve this kind of regularizer, which

1318
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919
involve this kind of regularizer, which
 

1319
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,110
involve this kind of regularizer, which
is why I wanted to make sure I talked

1320
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
is why I wanted to make sure I talked
 

1321
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,750
is why I wanted to make sure I talked
about it.

1322
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
about it.
 

1323
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,149
about it.
So it turns out when you do this kind of

1324
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:14,159
So it turns out when you do this kind of
 

1325
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,909
So it turns out when you do this kind of
thing,

1326
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:15,919
thing,
 

1327
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,389
thing,
you get a solution

1328
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:18,399
you get a solution
 

1329
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,230
you get a solution
that says

1330
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,240

 

1331
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,990

basically

1332
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,000
basically
 

1333
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,870
basically
your policy should be kind of

1334
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:26,880
your policy should be kind of
 

1335
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,389
your policy should be kind of
proportional to the reference policy

1336
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
proportional to the reference policy
 

1337
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,990
proportional to the reference policy
except with an adjustment.

1338
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,000

 

1339
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,389

If the reward was high,

1340
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
If the reward was high,
 

1341
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,950
If the reward was high,
you should upweight that kind of

1342
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
you should upweight that kind of
 

1343
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,710
you should upweight that kind of
response.

1344
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:44,720
response.
 

1345
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,350
response.
And if the reward is low, you should

1346
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:47,360
And if the reward is low, you should
 

1347
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,350
And if the reward is low, you should
downweight that kind of response. Does

1348
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:49,360
downweight that kind of response. Does
 

1349
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,149
downweight that kind of response. Does
everyone see what this is doing?

1350
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159

 

1351
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,230

And of course, if you do this upweing

1352
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,240
And of course, if you do this upweing
 

1353
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,630
And of course, if you do this upweing
down of uh of sequences, then you're no

1354
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
down of uh of sequences, then you're no
 

1355
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,909
down of uh of sequences, then you're no
longer going to have a probability that

1356
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:01,919
longer going to have a probability that
 

1357
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,389
longer going to have a probability that
adds to one. So divide by whatever you

1358
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
adds to one. So divide by whatever you
 

1359
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,750
adds to one. So divide by whatever you
need to do to make this thing be a

1360
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
need to do to make this thing be a
 

1361
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,269
need to do to make this thing be a
probability that adds to one. It sums up

1362
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:07,279
probability that adds to one. It sums up
 

1363
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,669
probability that adds to one. It sums up
to one.

1364
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:09,679
to one.
 

1365
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,990
to one.
Okay. So this is a this is what doing

1366
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
Okay. So this is a this is what doing
 

1367
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,990
Okay. So this is a this is what doing
kale regularization

1368
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,000
kale regularization
 

1369
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,990
kale regularization
does. Okay. It says

1370
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
does. Okay. It says
 

1371
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,029
does. Okay. It says
anchor to the reference policy and just

1372
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
anchor to the reference policy and just
 

1373
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,750
anchor to the reference policy and just
up and down weight probabilities to the

1374
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:25,760
up and down weight probabilities to the
 

1375
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,710
up and down weight probabilities to the
extent you can. And the purpose of doing

1376
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
extent you can. And the purpose of doing
 

1377
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,990
extent you can. And the purpose of doing
this is in part to avoid this

1378
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,000
this is in part to avoid this
 

1379
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,430
this is in part to avoid this
catastrophic forgetting type of

1380
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:33,440
catastrophic forgetting type of
 

1381
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,669
catastrophic forgetting type of
phenomena. Okay. So not have

1382
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:35,679
phenomena. Okay. So not have
 

1383
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,149
phenomena. Okay. So not have
capabilities go away. Okay. Yeah.

1384
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
capabilities go away. Okay. Yeah.
 

1385
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:38,710
capabilities go away. Okay. Yeah.
Question.

1386
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:38,720
Question.
 

1387
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,950
Question.
>> What is Z of X?

1388
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:40,960
>> What is Z of X?
 

1389
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,269
>> What is Z of X?
>> Oh, this is just whatever I need to do

1390
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:43,279
>> Oh, this is just whatever I need to do
 

1391
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,350
>> Oh, this is just whatever I need to do
to make this be a probability.

1392
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
to make this be a probability.
 

1393
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,470
to make this be a probability.
>> Oh,

1394
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,480
>> Oh,
 

1395
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,590
>> Oh,
>> right. So I normalize I Z of X is the

1396
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:49,600
>> right. So I normalize I Z of X is the
 

1397
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,950
>> right. So I normalize I Z of X is the
sum over all possible Y's of this thing.

1398
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
sum over all possible Y's of this thing.
 

1399
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,590
sum over all possible Y's of this thing.
So that this whole thing will be an

1400
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:57,600
So that this whole thing will be an
 

1401
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,470
So that this whole thing will be an
appropriate probability overwise.

1402
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:00,480
appropriate probability overwise.
 

1403
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,909
appropriate probability overwise.
>> Yeah. Question. Yes.

00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:01,919
>> Yeah. Question. Yes.
 

1405
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,630
>> Yeah. Question. Yes.
>> So it mitigates catastrophic forgetting

>> So it mitigates catastrophic forgetting
 

1407
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,710
>> So it mitigates catastrophic forgetting

ways. The basic thing it's doing is it's

1422
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:21,840
ways. The basic thing it's doing is it's
 

1423
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,750
ways. The basic thing it's doing is it's
keeping you close.

1424
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,760
keeping you close.
 

1425
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,750
keeping you close.
But uh if you if you set pyrf to be a

1426
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:25,760
But uh if you if you set pyrf to be a
 

1427
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,950
But uh if you if you set pyrf to be a
model that you don't want to forget too

1428
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:26,960
model that you don't want to forget too
 

1429
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,630
model that you don't want to forget too
much from then it does have that uh

1430
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:28,640
much from then it does have that uh
 

1431
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,630
much from then it does have that uh
property.

1432
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,640
property.
 

1433
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,190
property.
>> Yes.

1434
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,200
>> Yes.
 

1435
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,430
>> Yes.
>> Is this related to like energy?

1436
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
>> Is this related to like energy?
 

1437
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,190
>> Is this related to like energy?
Yeah, this is all very closely related

1438
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
Yeah, this is all very closely related
 

1439
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,149
Yeah, this is all very closely related
to energy and this is coming out of so

1440
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159
to energy and this is coming out of so
 

1441
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,990
to energy and this is coming out of so
these kind of kale divergence

1442
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,000
these kind of kale divergence
 

1443
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,750
these kind of kale divergence
regularizers have a long history in uh

1444
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:45,760
regularizers have a long history in uh
 

1445
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,509
regularizers have a long history in uh
information theory and statistical

1446
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
information theory and statistical
 

1447
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,509
information theory and statistical
physics where statistical physics they

1448
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
physics where statistical physics they
 

1449
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,870
physics where statistical physics they
originate in the context of thinking

1450
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880
originate in the context of thinking
 

1451
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,950
originate in the context of thinking
about things with energy and finding

1452
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:52,960
about things with energy and finding
 

1453
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,990
about things with energy and finding
states that are appropriately high

1454
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,000
states that are appropriately high
 

1455
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,029
states that are appropriately high
probability. Uh so it's it's all it has

1456
00:31:59,029 --> 00:31:59,039
probability. Uh so it's it's all it has
 

1457
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,230
probability. Uh so it's it's all it has
a long tradition which is why people um

1458
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:02,240
a long tradition which is why people um
 

1459
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,950
a long tradition which is why people um
use it but from a practical perspective

1460
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:04,960
use it but from a practical perspective
 

1461
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,110
use it but from a practical perspective
and deep learning point of view it is

1462
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,120
and deep learning point of view it is
 

1463
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,350
and deep learning point of view it is
completely reasonable to think of it as

1464
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,360
completely reasonable to think of it as
 

1465
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,590
completely reasonable to think of it as
I just have a few go-to defaults for

1466
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:11,600
I just have a few go-to defaults for
 

1467
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,909
I just have a few go-to defaults for
things and my go-to default

1468
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:13,919
things and my go-to default
 

1469
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,830
things and my go-to default
distributions are uniform and Gaussian

1470
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:15,840
distributions are uniform and Gaussian
 

1471
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,830
distributions are uniform and Gaussian
and my go-to default uh

1472
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:19,840
and my go-to default uh
 

1473
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,269
and my go-to default uh
distance measure on probabilities is

1474
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:21,279
distance measure on probabilities is
 

1475
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:27,350
distance measure on probabilities is
kale divergence and so I just use

1476
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360

 

1477
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,230

Okay. So if you want to understand for

1478
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,240
Okay. So if you want to understand for
 

1479
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,630
Okay. So if you want to understand for
example um GRPO which at this point you

1480
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
example um GRPO which at this point you
 

1481
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,070
example um GRPO which at this point you
have all the tools you need to to read

1482
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,080
have all the tools you need to to read
 

1483
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,710
have all the tools you need to to read
the paper and understand like our goal

1484
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:38,720
the paper and understand like our goal
 

1485
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,990
the paper and understand like our goal
remember is to teach you enough so you

1486
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,000
remember is to teach you enough so you
 

1487
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,029
remember is to teach you enough so you
can learn on your own. So GRPO is

1488
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:47,039

 

1489
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,389

in spirit like this some variations but

1490
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:50,399
in spirit like this some variations but
 

1491
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,029
in spirit like this some variations but
it also has a k regularization

1492
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:53,039
it also has a k regularization
 

1493
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,350
it also has a k regularization
regularizing term in it

1494
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:55,360
regularizing term in it
 

1495
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,350
regularizing term in it
and it clips in both direction. This is

1496
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,360
and it clips in both direction. This is
 

1497
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,750
and it clips in both direction. This is
this min is clipping only high values.

1498
00:32:59,750 --> 00:32:59,760
this min is clipping only high values.
 

1499
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,070
this min is clipping only high values.
It's also clipping low values in gpo

1500
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,080
It's also clipping low values in gpo
 

1501
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,630
It's also clipping low values in gpo
and it doesn't gpo doesn't take a bag of

1502
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:06,640
and it doesn't gpo doesn't take a bag of
 

1503
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,470
and it doesn't gpo doesn't take a bag of
tokens perspective. It takes a sequence

1504
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:08,480
tokens perspective. It takes a sequence
 

1505
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,310
tokens perspective. It takes a sequence
perspective

1506
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,320
perspective
 

1507
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,470
perspective
in terms of how it thinks about you know

1508
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:12,480
in terms of how it thinks about you know
 

1509
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,070
in terms of how it thinks about you know
this uh this part here

1510
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
this uh this part here
 

1511
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,990
this uh this part here
and uh this part here.

1512
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,000
and uh this part here.
 

1513
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,029
and uh this part here.
Okay. So there's a whole family of such

1514
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:23,039
Okay. So there's a whole family of such
 

1515
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,750
Okay. So there's a whole family of such
um algorithms that people have and the

1516
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:25,760
um algorithms that people have and the
 

1517
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,950
um algorithms that people have and the
key insight for verifiable rewards was

1518
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:28,960
key insight for verifiable rewards was
 

1519
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,509
key insight for verifiable rewards was
hey we can make lots of generations for

1520
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:31,519
hey we can make lots of generations for
 

1521
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,190
hey we can make lots of generations for
the same u prompt and that's useful for

1522
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,200
the same u prompt and that's useful for
 

1523
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,269
the same u prompt and that's useful for
us to see what's the variation what we

1524
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:37,279
us to see what's the variation what we
 

1525
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,549
us to see what's the variation what we
get remember all this is in the context

1526
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
get remember all this is in the context
 

1527
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,630
get remember all this is in the context
of earlier approaches to uh that I just

1528
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:44,640
of earlier approaches to uh that I just
 

1529
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,789
of earlier approaches to uh that I just
earlier even more basic approaches for

1530
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
earlier even more basic approaches for
 

1531
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,149
earlier even more basic approaches for
using test time compute which is

1532
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:48,159
using test time compute which is
 

1533
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,590
using test time compute which is
generate lots of samples and pick the

1534
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:49,600
generate lots of samples and pick the
 

1535
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,549
generate lots of samples and pick the
best one. Okay. So

1536
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:52,559
best one. Okay. So
 

1537
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,909
best one. Okay. So
now it turns out that if you have u a

1538
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:57,919
now it turns out that if you have u a
 

1539
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,669
now it turns out that if you have u a
reward model

1540
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:01,679

 

1541
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,710

and

1542
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:04,720

 

1543
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,269

you actually trust it, you can use that

1544
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:07,279
you actually trust it, you can use that
 

1545
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,950
you actually trust it, you can use that
to make any generative model better.

1546
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:10,960
to make any generative model better.
 

1547
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,550
to make any generative model better.
How? Generate 1,000

1548
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:14,560
How? Generate 1,000
 

1549
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,710
How? Generate 1,000
responses from your generative model and

1550
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:16,720
responses from your generative model and
 

1551
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,829
responses from your generative model and
pick the one that has the highest

1552
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:17,839
pick the one that has the highest
 

1553
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,750
pick the one that has the highest
reward.

1554
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:19,760
reward.
 

1555
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,669
reward.
Okay? like there's tricks like this that

1556
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:21,679
Okay? like there's tricks like this that
 

1557
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,950
Okay? like there's tricks like this that
uh exist and that's actually a very

1558
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:22,960
uh exist and that's actually a very
 

1559
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,389
uh exist and that's actually a very
strong baseline when you can actually

1560
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:24,399
strong baseline when you can actually
 

1561
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,149
strong baseline when you can actually
learn a reward model.

1562
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159

 

1563
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,790

Okay, so good. I wanted to make sure

1564
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:30,800
Okay, so good. I wanted to make sure
 

1565
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,190
Okay, so good. I wanted to make sure
people understood this and now I want to

1566
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,200
people understood this and now I want to
 

1567
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,190
people understood this and now I want to
switch uh to talk about what happens if

1568
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,200
switch uh to talk about what happens if
 

1569
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,550
switch uh to talk about what happens if
you don't have verifiable rewards. What

1570
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:40,560
you don't have verifiable rewards. What
 

1571
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,310
you don't have verifiable rewards. What
do people do? So what's RHF? Remember I

1572
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,320
do people do? So what's RHF? Remember I
 

1573
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,950
do people do? So what's RHF? Remember I
told you historically RLHF came first

1574
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:48,960
told you historically RLHF came first
 

1575
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,750
told you historically RLHF came first
in the development of these things but

1576
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:51,760
in the development of these things but
 

1577
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,430
in the development of these things but
uh it's easier to understand it kind of

1578
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:53,440
uh it's easier to understand it kind of
 

1579
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,589
uh it's easier to understand it kind of
in the reverse direction now.

1580
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:57,599
in the reverse direction now.
 

1581
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,109
in the reverse direction now.
So

1582
00:34:59,109 --> 00:34:59,119
So
 

1583
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,190
So
uh

1584
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
uh
 

1585
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,990
uh
when you have human feedback the idea is

1586
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,000
when you have human feedback the idea is
 

1587
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,109
when you have human feedback the idea is
you don't have a autograder that can

1588
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:07,119
you don't have a autograder that can
 

1589
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,430
you don't have a autograder that can
grade responses. You have to count on

1590
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:09,440
grade responses. You have to count on
 

1591
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,470
grade responses. You have to count on
people to grade the responses.

1592
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:14,480

 

1593
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,710

So here's some of the problems. Okay,

1594
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:18,720
So here's some of the problems. Okay,
 

1595
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,190
So here's some of the problems. Okay,
humans are expensive.

1596
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,200
humans are expensive.
 

1597
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,710
humans are expensive.
If you ask a human to grade something

1598
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:22,720
If you ask a human to grade something
 

1599
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,710
If you ask a human to grade something
and you say, "What's your batch size?"

1600
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
and you say, "What's your batch size?"
 

1601
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,950
and you say, "What's your batch size?"
My batch size is um 100.

1602
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:28,960
My batch size is um 100.
 

1603
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,950
My batch size is um 100.
Um what's your total size of your

1604
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
Um what's your total size of your
 

1605
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,870
Um what's your total size of your
training data? You want um 10,000.

1606
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:34,880
training data? You want um 10,000.
 

1607
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,390
training data? You want um 10,000.
Okay, you're going to have a human go

1608
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,400
Okay, you're going to have a human go
 

1609
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,950
Okay, you're going to have a human go
score 10,000 things. I mean, it's And

1610
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:38,960
score 10,000 things. I mean, it's And
 

1611
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,990
score 10,000 things. I mean, it's And
but this is like one shot. Then I do

1612
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,000
but this is like one shot. Then I do
 

1613
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,230
but this is like one shot. Then I do
this again over millions of examples.

1614
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,240
this again over millions of examples.
 

1615
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,270
this again over millions of examples.
This gets expensive fast.

1616
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,280
This gets expensive fast.
 

1617
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,150
This gets expensive fast.
So the key key insight was to say

1618
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,160
So the key key insight was to say
 

1619
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,470
So the key key insight was to say
instead of using human responses

1620
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,480
instead of using human responses
 

1621
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,390
instead of using human responses
directly

1622
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:56,400
directly
 

1623
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,670
directly
in RLHF the idea was I will use human

1624
00:35:59,670 --> 00:35:59,680
in RLHF the idea was I will use human
 

1625
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,190
in RLHF the idea was I will use human
responses

1626
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,200
responses
 

1627
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,069
responses
to train an AI reward model.

1628
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:06,079
to train an AI reward model.
 

1629
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,589
to train an AI reward model.
Okay. Okay, so I will try to train a

1630
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:07,599
Okay. Okay, so I will try to train a
 

1631
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,510
Okay. Okay, so I will try to train a
model that will be my reward model from

1632
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:09,520
model that will be my reward model from
 

1633
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,670
model that will be my reward model from
the human responses and then I'll use

1634
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680
the human responses and then I'll use
 

1635
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,829
the human responses and then I'll use
that reward model to grade the

1636
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
that reward model to grade the
 

1637
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,510
that reward model to grade the
generations that my model is doing

1638
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
generations that my model is doing
 

1639
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,550
generations that my model is doing
during RL training.

1640
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:18,560
during RL training.
 

1641
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,750
during RL training.
Everyone with me? So the human the human

1642
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:23,760
Everyone with me? So the human the human
 

1643
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,390
Everyone with me? So the human the human
model would basically act this this

1644
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,400
model would basically act this this
 

1645
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,190
model would basically act this this
model would do the job of um you know

1646
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,200
model would do the job of um you know
 

1647
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,270
model would do the job of um you know
this function

1648
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,280
this function
 

1649
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,670
this function
here.

1650
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:33,680
here.
 

1651
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,829
here.
So you still have to do RL type stuff

1652
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839
So you still have to do RL type stuff
 

1653
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,550
So you still have to do RL type stuff
because the sampling operations in the

1654
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:38,560
because the sampling operations in the
 

1655
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,870
because the sampling operations in the
generation are non-ifferiable.

1656
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:40,880
generation are non-ifferiable.
 

1657
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,870
generation are non-ifferiable.
Okay. So there's still there's still the

1658
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:42,880
Okay. So there's still there's still the
 

1659
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,710
Okay. So there's still there's still the
issue of non-ifferiability even if you

1660
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:44,720
issue of non-ifferiability even if you
 

1661
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,630
issue of non-ifferiability even if you
have a differentiable reward model.

1662
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:48,640
have a differentiable reward model.
 

1663
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,390
have a differentiable reward model.
Okay. So

1664
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:52,400

 

1665
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,150

second problem is

1666
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
second problem is
 

1667
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,470
second problem is
humans aren't good at giving real valued

1668
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
humans aren't good at giving real valued
 

1669
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,870
humans aren't good at giving real valued
scores.

1670
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:00,880
scores.
 

1671
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,870
scores.
Just very terrible.

1672
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:02,880
Just very terrible.
 

1673
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,870
Just very terrible.
Okay. Uh,

1674
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:06,880
Okay. Uh,
 

1675
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,470
Okay. Uh,
so what are humans good at? Humans good

1676
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:10,480
so what are humans good at? Humans good
 

1677
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,910
so what are humans good at? Humans good
are good at telling if something's

1678
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:11,920
are good at telling if something's
 

1679
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,069
are good at telling if something's
better than something else at

1680
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:14,079
better than something else at
 

1681
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,589
better than something else at
comparisons. Now, you've probably all

1682
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:15,599
comparisons. Now, you've probably all
 

1683
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,870
comparisons. Now, you've probably all
experienced this. You've experienced

1684
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:16,880
experienced this. You've experienced
 

1685
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,870
experienced this. You've experienced
this. If you're using some of the

1686
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:18,880
this. If you're using some of the
 

1687
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,630
this. If you're using some of the
commercial models, it'll every now and

1688
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
commercial models, it'll every now and
 

1689
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,710
commercial models, it'll every now and
then ask you, which do you like better,

1690
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:22,720
then ask you, which do you like better,
 

1691
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,829
then ask you, which do you like better,
this or this? This is why it's doing

1692
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:25,839
this or this? This is why it's doing
 

1693
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,470
this or this? This is why it's doing
that. It's trying to get human feedback

1694
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,480
that. It's trying to get human feedback
 

1695
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,310
that. It's trying to get human feedback
on what's better.

1696
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:32,320

 

1697
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,310

So now you have a conundrum which is

1698
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:38,320

 

1699
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,950

your reward model is supposed to be

1700
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:40,960
your reward model is supposed to be
 

1701
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,150
your reward model is supposed to be
giving you something which is a real

1702
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
giving you something which is a real
 

1703
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,829
giving you something which is a real
number

1704
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:45,839
number
 

1705
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,990
number
and

1706
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,000
and
 

1707
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,670
and
humans are good at giving binary

1708
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:49,680
humans are good at giving binary
 

1709
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,990
humans are good at giving binary
feedback. So you have to learn a real

1710
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,000
feedback. So you have to learn a real
 

1711
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,310
feedback. So you have to learn a real
valued reward model from binary feedback

1712
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:54,320
valued reward model from binary feedback
 

1713
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,109
valued reward model from binary feedback
is the traditional approach. So what

1714
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:57,119
is the traditional approach. So what
 

1715
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,230
is the traditional approach. So what
people do is follow the following kind

1716
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,240
people do is follow the following kind
 

1717
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,349
people do is follow the following kind
of course pipeline.

1718
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,359

 

1719
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,390

You pre-train a model, you SFT it on

1720
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,400
You pre-train a model, you SFT it on
 

1721
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,230
You pre-train a model, you SFT it on
good examples to get it to be sort of

1722
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,240
good examples to get it to be sort of
 

1723
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,910
good examples to get it to be sort of
good enough to generate reasonable

1724
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:11,920
good enough to generate reasonable
 

1725
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,109
good enough to generate reasonable
responses. Then you generate a bunch of

1726
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:15,119
responses. Then you generate a bunch of
 

1727
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,390
responses. Then you generate a bunch of
uh things that you want to be able to

1728
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:18,400
uh things that you want to be able to
 

1729
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,470
uh things that you want to be able to
score.

1730
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:20,480
score.
 

1731
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,230
score.
You get humans to score them on

1732
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,240
You get humans to score them on
 

1733
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,790
You get humans to score them on
comparisons.

1734
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800
comparisons.
 

1735
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,470
comparisons.
Okay. that costs a lot of money in human

1736
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:28,480
Okay. that costs a lot of money in human
 

1737
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,069
Okay. that costs a lot of money in human
time. Then you use that data to train or

1738
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:32,079
time. Then you use that data to train or
 

1739
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,670
time. Then you use that data to train or
update your reward model.

1740
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:35,680
update your reward model.
 

1741
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,790
update your reward model.
Okay. Now having done this, you then

1742
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:38,800
Okay. Now having done this, you then
 

1743
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,470
Okay. Now having done this, you then
proceed to do RL as though you're doing

1744
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:42,480
proceed to do RL as though you're doing
 

1745
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,349
proceed to do RL as though you're doing
like RLVR. Okay. Except you have this

1746
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:45,359
like RLVR. Okay. Except you have this
 

1747
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,589
like RLVR. Okay. Except you have this
reward model directly. So you can follow

1748
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:47,599
reward model directly. So you can follow
 

1749
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,030
reward model directly. So you can follow
some RL recipe to keep training this.

1750
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,040
some RL recipe to keep training this.
 

1751
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,829
some RL recipe to keep training this.
Now as you do this training what'll

1752
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839
Now as you do this training what'll
 

1753
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,430
Now as you do this training what'll
happen is the model will start changing

1754
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,440
happen is the model will start changing
 

1755
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,630
happen is the model will start changing
and be different and now there will be a

1756
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:58,640
and be different and now there will be a
 

1757
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,790
and be different and now there will be a
discrepancy a significant discrepancy at

1758
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:00,800
discrepancy a significant discrepancy at
 

1759
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,950
discrepancy a significant discrepancy at
some point between this model's

1760
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:02,960
some point between this model's
 

1761
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,190
some point between this model's
probability of doing generations and

1762
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:05,200
probability of doing generations and
 

1763
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,030
probability of doing generations and
this thing that you use to train the re

1764
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,040
this thing that you use to train the re
 

1765
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,750
this thing that you use to train the re
reward model. So now the problem is your

1766
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:09,760
reward model. So now the problem is your
 

1767
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,910
reward model. So now the problem is your
generations that this thing is making

1768
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:11,920
generations that this thing is making
 

1769
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,630
generations that this thing is making
might become out of distribution from

1770
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:14,640
might become out of distribution from
 

1771
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,310
might become out of distribution from
the perspective what the reward model

1772
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:16,320
the perspective what the reward model
 

1773
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,790
the perspective what the reward model
was trained at. Everyone see the issue?

1774
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:18,800
was trained at. Everyone see the issue?
 

1775
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,750
was trained at. Everyone see the issue?
So you do update you say okay let's do

1776
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:21,760
So you do update you say okay let's do
 

1777
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,510
So you do update you say okay let's do
some more generations and get some more

1778
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:23,520
some more generations and get some more
 

1779
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,430
some more generations and get some more
human feedback

1780
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,440
human feedback
 

1781
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,910
human feedback
and this is the gold standard for doing

1782
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:27,920
and this is the gold standard for doing
 

1783
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,190
and this is the gold standard for doing
um RLHF

1784
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:31,200

 

1785
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,390

and you you can hopefully understand

1786
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,400
and you you can hopefully understand
 

1787
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,910
and you you can hopefully understand
this in light of everything we've talked

1788
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:33,920
this in light of everything we've talked
 

1789
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,510
this in light of everything we've talked
about

1790
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:35,520
about
 

1791
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,349
about
again lots of algorithmic details and

1792
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:37,359
again lots of algorithmic details and
 

1793
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,190
again lots of algorithmic details and
variations that people have in how you

1794
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:39,200
variations that people have in how you
 

1795
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,510
variations that people have in how you
do uh this and then

1796
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:43,520
do uh this and then
 

1797
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,870
do uh this and then
but then the question is how do you do

1798
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:44,880
but then the question is how do you do
 

1799
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,270
but then the question is how do you do
this

1800
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:47,280
this
 

1801
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,630
this
how do you train a reward model based on

1802
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:50,640
how do you train a reward model based on
 

1803
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,510
how do you train a reward model based on
uh binary comparisons.

1804
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:53,520
uh binary comparisons.
 

1805
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,430
uh binary comparisons.
But that you realize, oh, okay, that you

1806
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,440
But that you realize, oh, okay, that you
 

1807
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,390
But that you realize, oh, okay, that you
know how to do, right? Because that's

1808
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:58,400
know how to do, right? Because that's
 

1809
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,750
know how to do, right? Because that's
kind of like a classifier. Your all ML

1810
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:01,760
kind of like a classifier. Your all ML
 

1811
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,550
kind of like a classifier. Your all ML
classifiers generate scores and you can

1812
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:04,560
classifiers generate scores and you can
 

1813
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,069
classifiers generate scores and you can
train scores based on binary

1814
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:06,079
train scores based on binary
 

1815
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,150
train scores based on binary
information.

1816
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,160
information.
 

1817
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,190
information.
So this is like a classical ML problem.

1818
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:11,200
So this is like a classical ML problem.
 

1819
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,430
So this is like a classical ML problem.
You just train a score. And if the score

1820
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,440
You just train a score. And if the score
 

1821
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,550
You just train a score. And if the score
can then be used to

1822
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:16,560
can then be used to
 

1823
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,470
can then be used to
successfully do these binary

1824
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:18,480
successfully do these binary
 

1825
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,349
successfully do these binary
comparisons, great.

1826
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:21,359
comparisons, great.
 

1827
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,550
comparisons, great.
You'll have a useful score.

1828
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:24,560
You'll have a useful score.
 

1829
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,310
You'll have a useful score.
Okay, that's uh that's what's happening

1830
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:26,320
Okay, that's uh that's what's happening
 

1831
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,430
Okay, that's uh that's what's happening
here. Now, the key thing I want to talk

1832
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,440
here. Now, the key thing I want to talk
 

1833
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,870
here. Now, the key thing I want to talk
about is something called DPO.

1834
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
about is something called DPO.
 

1835
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,430
about is something called DPO.
And what DPO did was

1836
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:37,440
And what DPO did was
 

1837
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,510
And what DPO did was
it said, this is a figure from the

1838
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520
it said, this is a figure from the

your language model is secretly a reward

1844
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,280
your language model is secretly a reward
 

1845
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,230
your language model is secretly a reward
model. Um came out in 2023 very

00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:52,800
influential paper.
 

1849
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,270
influential paper.
uh one of the the faculty authors, one

1850
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,280
uh one of the the faculty authors, one
 

1851
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,109
uh one of the the faculty authors, one
of the faculty authors was Chelsea Finn

who we mentioned before from the mammal

1854
00:40:59,670 --> 00:40:59,680
who we mentioned before from the mammal
 

1855
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,349
who we mentioned before from the mammal
work

1856
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:01,359
work
 

1857
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,430
work
and it says instead of having all of

1858
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:03,440
and it says instead of having all of
 

1859
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,109
and it says instead of having all of
this uh complexity,

1860
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:07,119
this uh complexity,
 

1861
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,109
this uh complexity,
can we just take the preference data

1862
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:11,119
can we just take the preference data
 

1863
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,750
can we just take the preference data
that we get from here

1864
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:13,760
that we get from here
 

1865
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,270
that we get from here
and not train a reward model at all?

1866
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:17,280
and not train a reward model at all?
 

1867
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,589
and not train a reward model at all?
Just take the preference data itself and

1868
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:19,599
Just take the preference data itself and
 

1869
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,630
Just take the preference data itself and
use that to do finetuning on the model.

1870
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:22,640
use that to do finetuning on the model.
 

1871
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,630
use that to do finetuning on the model.
Okay,

1872
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
Okay,
 

1873
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,510
Okay,
so this is the idea.

1874
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:31,520

 

1875
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,109

So when you have preference outputs, all

1876
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:35,119
So when you have preference outputs, all
 

1877
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,109
So when you have preference outputs, all
you have are pairs that say this is the

1878
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:39,119
you have are pairs that say this is the
 

1879
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,670
you have are pairs that say this is the
winner, this is the better response, and

1880
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:41,680
winner, this is the better response, and
 

1881
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,670
winner, this is the better response, and
this is the loser, this is the worst

1882
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
this is the loser, this is the worst
 

1883
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,030
this is the loser, this is the worst
response. That's all you have. Can I use

1884
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,040
response. That's all you have. Can I use
 

1885
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,270
response. That's all you have. Can I use
this to do fine-tuning?

1886
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,280

 

1887
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,910

Okay, everyone good with this? Okay,

1888
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:55,920
Okay, everyone good with this? Okay,
 

1889
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,430
Okay, everyone good with this? Okay,
so the first thing you might try is to

1890
00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,440
so the first thing you might try is to
 

1891
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,630
so the first thing you might try is to
say great,

1892
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:02,640
say great,
 

1893
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,430
say great,
let me just try to maximize the

1894
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,440
let me just try to maximize the
 

1895
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,950
let me just try to maximize the
probability of the winners and minimize

1896
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:08,960
probability of the winners and minimize
 

1897
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,069
probability of the winners and minimize
the probability of the losers.

1898
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:12,079
the probability of the losers.
 

1899
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,390
the probability of the losers.
Right? So I'll do gradient ascent on

1900
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:14,400
Right? So I'll do gradient ascent on
 

1901
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,430
Right? So I'll do gradient ascent on
winners and gradient descent on losers,

1902
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,440
winners and gradient descent on losers,
 

1903
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,470
winners and gradient descent on losers,
right? For their probabilities. Um, I

1904
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
right? For their probabilities. Um, I
 

1905
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,630
right? For their probabilities. Um, I
can do that.

1906
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:22,640
can do that.
 

1907
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,309
can do that.
And it seems like a good idea. It seems

1908
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:24,319
And it seems like a good idea. It seems
 

1909
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,470
And it seems like a good idea. It seems
like actually it's following the spirit

1910
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,480
like actually it's following the spirit
 

1911
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:33,030
like actually it's following the spirit
of what we were talking about with the

1912
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,040

 

1913
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,270

with this thing, right? Because remember

1914
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
with this thing, right? Because remember
 

1915
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,109
with this thing, right? Because remember
what is this doing right up here for

1916
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:37,119
what is this doing right up here for
 

1917
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,270
what is this doing right up here for
verifiable rewards? It's saying make the

1918
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:39,280
verifiable rewards? It's saying make the
 

1919
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,390
verifiable rewards? It's saying make the
responses that are correct more likely

1920
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400
responses that are correct more likely
 

1921
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,670
responses that are correct more likely
and make the responses that are

1922
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:43,680
and make the responses that are
 

1923
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,910
and make the responses that are
incorrect less likely. Right? That's

1924
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:45,920
incorrect less likely. Right? That's
 

1925
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,270
incorrect less likely. Right? That's
what's happening here. Everyone remember

1926
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:47,280
what's happening here. Everyone remember
 

1927
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,190
what's happening here. Everyone remember
this? See this? So like try to do the

1928
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:49,200
this? See this? So like try to do the
 

1929
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,710
this? See this? So like try to do the
same thing. We have winners, we have

1930
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:50,720
same thing. We have winners, we have
 

1931
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,870
same thing. We have winners, we have
losers.

1932
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:54,880

 

1933
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,150

Okay. So

1934
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,160
Okay. So
 

1935
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,950
Okay. So
what happens? So here's table three from

1936
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:00,960
what happens? So here's table three from
 

1937
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,829
what happens? So here's table three from
the paper. Um

1938
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:03,839
the paper. Um
 

1939
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,390
the paper. Um
it's trying to do a like a summarization

1940
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:06,400
it's trying to do a like a summarization
 

1941
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,190
it's trying to do a like a summarization
task. They have some ideas of good

1942
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,200
task. They have some ideas of good
 

1943
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,069
task. They have some ideas of good
summaries and bad summaries. And they

1944
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:12,079
summaries and bad summaries. And they
 

1945
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,030
summaries and bad summaries. And they
said, you know, here is this prompt.

1946
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,040
said, you know, here is this prompt.
 

1947
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,270
said, you know, here is this prompt.
It's like some Reddit uh data. it wants

1948
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,280
It's like some Reddit uh data. it wants
 

1949
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,190
It's like some Reddit uh data. it wants
to summarize a post or there's some

1950
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:19,200
to summarize a post or there's some
 

1951
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,550
to summarize a post or there's some
prompt goes on

1952
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:22,560
prompt goes on
 

1953
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,190
prompt goes on
and then what's the response and after

1954
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,200
and then what's the response and after
 

1955
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:32,550
and then what's the response and after
you do this you get just junk

1956
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,560

 

1957
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,910

so the model had been sfted to sort of

1958
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:35,920
so the model had been sfted to sort of
 

1959
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,790
so the model had been sfted to sort of
do something on this task and now it's

1960
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800
do something on this task and now it's
 

1961
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,910
do something on this task and now it's
just completely lost everything

1962
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:41,920
just completely lost everything
 

1963
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,109
just completely lost everything
okay everyone this is bad.

1964
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:47,119
okay everyone this is bad.
 

1965
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,990
okay everyone this is bad.
What happened? Why did this happen?

1966
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,000
What happened? Why did this happen?
 

1967
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,670
What happened? Why did this happen?
Right? This is like a kind of

1968
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:51,680
Right? This is like a kind of
 

1969
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,589
Right? This is like a kind of
forgetting, but it's a kind of

1970
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:53,599
forgetting, but it's a kind of
 

1971
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,309
forgetting, but it's a kind of
forgetting that has been exacerbated by

1972
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:56,319
forgetting that has been exacerbated by
 

1973
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,790
forgetting that has been exacerbated by
saying that perfectly grammatical and

1974
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:58,800
saying that perfectly grammatical and
 

1975
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,950
saying that perfectly grammatical and
reasonable responses that just happen

1976
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:00,960
reasonable responses that just happen
 

1977
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,190
reasonable responses that just happen
not to be preferred are actually like

1978
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,200
not to be preferred are actually like
 

1979
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,030
not to be preferred are actually like
really bad.

1980
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:05,040
really bad.
 

1981
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,470
really bad.
That's what's happening here.

1982
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:08,480
That's what's happening here.
 

1983
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,390
That's what's happening here.
Does everyone see that? When I tell it

1984
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,400
Does everyone see that? When I tell it
 

1985
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,230
Does everyone see that? When I tell it
don't do this, it doesn't like there's

1986
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:14,240
don't do this, it doesn't like there's
 

1987
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,790
don't do this, it doesn't like there's
many different reasons to not do this.

1988
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:16,800
many different reasons to not do this.
 

1989
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,470
many different reasons to not do this.
And one could be like, oh, this is

1990
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:18,480
And one could be like, oh, this is
 

1991
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,230
And one could be like, oh, this is
coherent. I shouldn't be coherent.

1992
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:22,240
coherent. I shouldn't be coherent.
 

1993
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,870
coherent. I shouldn't be coherent.
You see, like it's ambiguous. So this

1994
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:24,880
You see, like it's ambiguous. So this
 

1995
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,230
You see, like it's ambiguous. So this
thing is saying make these good

1996
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:26,240
thing is saying make these good
 

1997
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,430
thing is saying make these good
responses and this is saying be

1998
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:27,440
responses and this is saying be
 

1999
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,510
responses and this is saying be
incoherent. That's not what you meant,

2000
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:29,520
incoherent. That's not what you meant,
 

2001
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,430
incoherent. That's not what you meant,
but that could a perfectly reasonable

2002
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:31,440
but that could a perfectly reasonable
 

2003
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,589
but that could a perfectly reasonable
interpretation from the model's point of

2004
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:33,599
interpretation from the model's point of
 

2005
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,390
interpretation from the model's point of
view. So this doesn't work. Okay.

2006
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,400
view. So this doesn't work. Okay.
 

2007
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,950
view. So this doesn't work. Okay.
So then you say, "Okay, okay, whatever.

2008
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:40,960
So then you say, "Okay, okay, whatever.
 

2009
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,589
So then you say, "Okay, okay, whatever.
Let me just ignore the losers at all. I

2010
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:43,599
Let me just ignore the losers at all. I
 

2011
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,950
Let me just ignore the losers at all. I
have good examples. Let me just SFT on

2012
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:46,960
have good examples. Let me just SFT on
 

2013
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,309
have good examples. Let me just SFT on
the winners. Just treat the winners as

2014
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:50,319
the winners. Just treat the winners as
 

2015
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,550
the winners. Just treat the winners as
these are good examples."

2016
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:52,560
these are good examples."
 

2017
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,309
these are good examples."
If you do that, it's not horrible. The

2018
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
If you do that, it's not horrible. The
 

2019
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,910
If you do that, it's not horrible. The
paper doesn't have a table. I wish it

2020
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:55,920
paper doesn't have a table. I wish it
 

2021
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,990
paper doesn't have a table. I wish it
did for how this one behaved. It's a key

2022
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:58,000
did for how this one behaved. It's a key
 

2023
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,430
did for how this one behaved. It's a key
part of their algorithm, but not talked

2024
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,440
part of their algorithm, but not talked
 

2025
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,390
part of their algorithm, but not talked
about as a baseline. Um,

2026
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:04,400

 

2027
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,109

so then what they what they do is they

2028
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:07,119
so then what they what they do is they
 

2029
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,750
so then what they what they do is they
say, "Great. Now this here's the DPO

2030
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:09,760
say, "Great. Now this here's the DPO
 

2031
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,750
say, "Great. Now this here's the DPO
idea.

2032
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:11,760
idea.
 

2033
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,430
idea.
The DPO idea is is there a question?

2034
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:15,440
The DPO idea is is there a question?
 

2035
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,109
The DPO idea is is there a question?
Okay, DPO idea is SFT on the winners

2036
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:19,119
Okay, DPO idea is SFT on the winners
 

2037
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,950
Okay, DPO idea is SFT on the winners
first.

2038
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:20,960
first.
 

2039
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,270
first.
Call this your new reference. We're

2040
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:23,280
Call this your new reference. We're
 

2041
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,550
Call this your new reference. We're
going to start here.

2042
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560

 

2043
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,470

then use the following loss

2044
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,480
then use the following loss
 

2045
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,109
then use the following loss
starting at x0 to do uh gradient descent

2046
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:39,119

 

2047
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,550

I will take so this minus sign in front

2048
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:44,560
I will take so this minus sign in front
 

2049
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,150
I will take so this minus sign in front
of this expectation that just comes from

2050
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:46,160
of this expectation that just comes from
 

2051
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,790
of this expectation that just comes from
the fact I'm viewing this as a loss

2052
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:48,800
the fact I'm viewing this as a loss
 

2053
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,790
the fact I'm viewing this as a loss
otherwise this if I treat as a reward

2054
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:50,800
otherwise this if I treat as a reward
 

2055
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,309
otherwise this if I treat as a reward
this would be this minus sign wouldn't

2056
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:52,319
this would be this minus sign wouldn't
 

2057
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,109
this would be this minus sign wouldn't
be there

2058
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:55,119
be there
 

2059
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,630
be there
let me take the log of the sigmoid

2060
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:58,640
let me take the log of the sigmoid
 

2061
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,829
let me take the log of the sigmoid
of this following difference of ratios

2062
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:01,839
of this following difference of ratios
 

2063
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,069
of this following difference of ratios
of probabilities. So what I'm going to

2064
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:04,079
of probabilities. So what I'm going to
 

2065
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,550
of probabilities. So what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take the probability

2066
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:06,560
do is I'm going to take the probability
 

2067
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,390
do is I'm going to take the probability
that my model that I'm training

2068
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,400
that my model that I'm training
 

2069
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,550
that my model that I'm training
generates the winner response divided by

2070
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:10,560
generates the winner response divided by
 

2071
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,910
generates the winner response divided by
the probability the reference model

2072
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:11,920
the probability the reference model
 

2073
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,630
the probability the reference model
generates the winner response.

2074
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:14,640
generates the winner response.
 

2075
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,109
generates the winner response.
Subtract that subtract from that the

2076
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:17,119
Subtract that subtract from that the
 

2077
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,349
Subtract that subtract from that the
probability the same ratio for the loser

2078
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:21,359
probability the same ratio for the loser
 

2079
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,750
probability the same ratio for the loser
and

2080
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:23,760
and
 

2081
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,589
and
just run gradient uh gradient on this.

2082
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:29,599
just run gradient uh gradient on this.
 

2083
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,790
just run gradient uh gradient on this.
Okay. And the sigmoid is just uh here.

2084
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
Okay. And the sigmoid is just uh here.
 

2085
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,870
Okay. And the sigmoid is just uh here.
Now if you read the paper and I think

2086
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:34,880
Now if you read the paper and I think
 

2087
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,390
Now if you read the paper and I think
we'll give you a homework that walks you

2088
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:36,400
we'll give you a homework that walks you
 

2089
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,510
we'll give you a homework that walks you
through kind of more of the derivation

2090
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:37,520
through kind of more of the derivation
 

2091
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,710
through kind of more of the derivation
of this. I don't want to spend too much

2092
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:38,720
of this. I don't want to spend too much
 

2093
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,630
of this. I don't want to spend too much
time on it.

2094
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:40,640
time on it.
 

2095
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,270
time on it.
What it's doing is it's using a model

2096
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:43,280
What it's doing is it's using a model
 

2097
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,349
What it's doing is it's using a model
for how the human is generating

2098
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:45,359
for how the human is generating
 

2099
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,270
for how the human is generating
preferences.

2100
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,280
preferences.
 

2101
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,109
preferences.
Okay, how it chooses things and it kind

2102
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:49,119
Okay, how it chooses things and it kind
 

2103
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,510
Okay, how it chooses things and it kind
of builds that in.

2104
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:51,520
of builds that in.
 

2105
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,550
of builds that in.
Okay. So what's happening here is that

2106
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:54,560
Okay. So what's happening here is that
 

2107
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,309
Okay. So what's happening here is that
it's just doing SGD on preference pairs

2108
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,319
it's just doing SGD on preference pairs
 

2109
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,510
it's just doing SGD on preference pairs
except it's using this loss.

2110
00:46:59,510 --> 00:46:59,520
except it's using this loss.
 

2111
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:09,109
except it's using this loss.
Yeah.

2112
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:09,119

 

2113
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,829

>> Yes. Exactly. You're still penalizing

2114
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:11,839
>> Yes. Exactly. You're still penalizing
 

2115
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,230
>> Yes. Exactly. You're still penalizing
the loser and uplifting the winner,

2116
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:14,240
the loser and uplifting the winner,
 

2117
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,910
the loser and uplifting the winner,
except you're doing it slightly

2118
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:15,920
except you're doing it slightly
 

2119
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,510
except you're doing it slightly
differently.

2120
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:17,520
differently.
 

2121
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,589
differently.
So what this should remind you of is

2122
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:19,599
So what this should remind you of is
 

2123
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,150
So what this should remind you of is
something you saw uh we saw an example

2124
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:22,160
something you saw uh we saw an example
 

2125
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,670
something you saw uh we saw an example
of in in ML class uh basic ML class

2126
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:25,680
of in in ML class uh basic ML class
 

2127
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,710
of in in ML class uh basic ML class
where you say you could do

2128
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:26,720
where you say you could do
 

2129
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,710
where you say you could do
classification just using squared loss.

2130
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:30,720
classification just using squared loss.
 

2131
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,030
classification just using squared loss.
Okay. So saying make everything that's a

2132
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,040
Okay. So saying make everything that's a
 

2133
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,630
Okay. So saying make everything that's a
positive class mapped to plus one

2134
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:34,640
positive class mapped to plus one
 

2135
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,829
positive class mapped to plus one
everything that's a negative class

2136
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:35,839
everything that's a negative class
 

2137
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,470
everything that's a negative class
mapped in minus one. And it kind of

2138
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:38,480
mapped in minus one. And it kind of
 

2139
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,630
mapped in minus one. And it kind of
works actually. It's not like it's bad.

2140
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:40,640
works actually. It's not like it's bad.
 

2141
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,710
works actually. It's not like it's bad.
Um but it can sometimes be not as good.

2142
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:44,720
Um but it can sometimes be not as good.
 

2143
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,069
Um but it can sometimes be not as good.
And so what you do is you use something

2144
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:46,079
And so what you do is you use something
 

2145
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,710
And so what you do is you use something
like logistic loss which shapes this a

2146
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:48,720
like logistic loss which shapes this a
 

2147
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,390
like logistic loss which shapes this a
little bit differently and is more

2148
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,400
little bit differently and is more
 

2149
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,150
little bit differently and is more
sensitive to what you want that treat

2150
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:52,160
sensitive to what you want that treat
 

2151
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,510
sensitive to what you want that treat
like classification problem and that

2152
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:53,520
like classification problem and that
 

2153
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,750
like classification problem and that
tends to work a little bit better. So

2154
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:55,760
tends to work a little bit better. So
 

2155
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,670
tends to work a little bit better. So
this is the same kind of idea. It's

2156
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:57,680
this is the same kind of idea. It's
 

2157
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,430
this is the same kind of idea. It's
asking the question what is the

2158
00:47:59,430 --> 00:47:59,440
asking the question what is the
 

2159
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,630
asking the question what is the
counterpart of the right kind of loss

2160
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
counterpart of the right kind of loss
 

2161
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,190
counterpart of the right kind of loss
function for preferences and it uses

2162
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:05,200
function for preferences and it uses
 

2163
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,309
function for preferences and it uses
there's actually variations. This is

2164
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:06,319
there's actually variations. This is
 

2165
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,870
there's actually variations. This is
DPO. There's others that treat it

2166
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:08,880
DPO. There's others that treat it
 

2167
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,829
DPO. There's others that treat it
differently. There's some that involve

2168
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:11,839
differently. There's some that involve
 

2169
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,230
differently. There's some that involve
uh kind of human

2170
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:14,240
uh kind of human
 

2171
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,550
uh kind of human
irrationality models where you prefer

2172
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:16,560
irrationality models where you prefer
 

2173
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,109
irrationality models where you prefer
winning more or you you you dislike

2174
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:19,119
winning more or you you you dislike
 

2175
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,589
winning more or you you you dislike
losing more than you like winning. So

2176
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599
losing more than you like winning. So
 

2177
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,790
losing more than you like winning. So
things like this, lots of variations

2178
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:22,800
things like this, lots of variations
 

2179
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,230
things like this, lots of variations
that people have, but it's kind of

2180
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:24,240
that people have, but it's kind of
 

2181
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,829
that people have, but it's kind of
shaping the loss to be a little

2182
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:25,839
shaping the loss to be a little
 

2183
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,630
shaping the loss to be a little
different. But

2184
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:28,640
different. But
 

2185
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,710
different. But
what's interesting and I think as a

2186
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
what's interesting and I think as a
 

2187
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,430
what's interesting and I think as a
question I want to ask first is just I

2188
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:33,440
question I want to ask first is just I
 

2189
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,470
question I want to ask first is just I
make sure people are following me is

2190
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:36,480
make sure people are following me is
 

2191
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,069
make sure people are following me is
if you look at this as a loss function

2192
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:40,079
if you look at this as a loss function
 

2193
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,230
if you look at this as a loss function
where are the gradients going this is

2194
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:42,240
where are the gradients going this is
 

2195
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,950
where are the gradients going this is
just SGD there's nothing here that's

2196
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:44,960
just SGD there's nothing here that's
 

2197
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,950
just SGD there's nothing here that's
happening I'm not drawing this stuff

2198
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:46,960
happening I'm not drawing this stuff
 

2199
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,829
happening I'm not drawing this stuff
according to in in the whole point of

2200
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:49,839
according to in in the whole point of
 

2201
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,349
according to in in the whole point of
one of the big points of doing this is

2202
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:51,359
one of the big points of doing this is
 

2203
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,190
one of the big points of doing this is
you can do this even if you didn't draw

2204
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:53,200
you can do this even if you didn't draw
 

2205
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,670
you can do this even if you didn't draw
data from a particular distribution it's

2206
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
data from a particular distribution it's
 

2207
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,470
data from a particular distribution it's
just there you have preference data.

2208
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480
just there you have preference data.
 

2209
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,630
just there you have preference data.
So this is just your your training data

2210
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:00,640
So this is just your your training data
 

2211
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,870
So this is just your your training data
set.

2212
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:02,880
set.
 

2213
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,589
set.
Now if you do this, the gradients,

2214
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:07,599
Now if you do this, the gradients,
 

2215
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:08,790
Now if you do this, the gradients,
they'll go through the log, they go

2216
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:08,800
they'll go through the log, they go
 

2217
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,150
they'll go through the log, they go
through the sigma, but they're not going

2218
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
through the sigma, but they're not going
 

2219
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,829
through the sigma, but they're not going
to enter the reference policy. The

2220
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:11,839
to enter the reference policy. The
 

2221
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,349
to enter the reference policy. The
reference policy is not being trained.

2222
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:13,359
reference policy is not being trained.
 

2223
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,750
reference policy is not being trained.
It's just sitting there.

2224
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:15,760
It's just sitting there.
 

2225
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,750
It's just sitting there.
And so at first glance, you look at this

2226
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:17,760
And so at first glance, you look at this
 

2227
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,630
And so at first glance, you look at this
and you say, wait, log of a ratio is

2228
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:20,640
and you say, wait, log of a ratio is
 

2229
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,430
and you say, wait, log of a ratio is
just a difference of logs.

2230
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:23,440
just a difference of logs.
 

2231
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,950
just a difference of logs.
And so inside this thing I just have a

2232
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:26,960
And so inside this thing I just have a
 

2233
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,349
And so inside this thing I just have a
sum of four terms.

2234
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:29,359
sum of four terms.
 

2235
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,870
sum of four terms.
Two of which the gradients are not going

2236
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:30,880
Two of which the gradients are not going
 

2237
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,630
Two of which the gradients are not going
into at all.

2238
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:34,640

 

2239
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,549

So the other terms just have only the pi

2240
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:38,559
So the other terms just have only the pi
 

2241
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,030
So the other terms just have only the pi
theta in them.

2242
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
theta in them.
 

2243
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,510
theta in them.
So how is this any different from as the

2244
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:43,520
So how is this any different from as the
 

2245
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,030
So how is this any different from as the
question was how is this any diff? Why

2246
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,040
question was how is this any diff? Why
 

2247
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,549
question was how is this any diff? Why
is this any different from just

2248
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:46,559
is this any different from just
 

2249
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,069
is this any different from just
uplifting

2250
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:48,079
uplifting
 

2251
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,109
uplifting
the positive examples and down down

2252
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:51,119
the positive examples and down down
 

2253
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,069
the positive examples and down down
pushing down the negative examples? Does

2254
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:54,079
pushing down the negative examples? Does
 

2255
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,349
pushing down the negative examples? Does
everyone see the question? Like just so

2256
00:49:57,349 --> 00:49:57,359
everyone see the question? Like just so
 

2257
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,750
everyone see the question? Like just so
take uh take a minute and think about it

2258
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:01,760
take uh take a minute and think about it
 

2259
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,069
take uh take a minute and think about it
and just I'm asking at first a purely

2260
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:04,079
and just I'm asking at first a purely
 

2261
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,990
and just I'm asking at first a purely
technical level like are these doing

2262
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
technical level like are these doing
 

2263
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,870
technical level like are these doing
anything given this given these facts

2264
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
anything given this given these facts
 

2265
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,270
anything given this given these facts
are are there? What what are they doing

2266
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:11,280
are are there? What what are they doing
 

2267
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,950
are are there? What what are they doing
at all even like is it possible for them

2268
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
at all even like is it possible for them
 

2269
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,349
at all even like is it possible for them
to have any effect?

2270
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:15,359
to have any effect?
 

2271
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,549
to have any effect?
So just take a minute talk to your

2272
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:16,559
So just take a minute talk to your
 

2273
00:50:16,559 --> 00:51:08,069
So just take a minute talk to your
neighbors.

2274
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:08,079

 

2275
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,750

Okay. So, I'll stop.

2276
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:11,760
Okay. So, I'll stop.
 

2277
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,990
Okay. So, I'll stop.
>> So, chance to think about it. So, who

2278
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,000
>> So, chance to think about it. So, who
 

2279
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,390
>> So, chance to think about it. So, who
wants to suggest to me why these might

2280
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:16,400
wants to suggest to me why these might
 

2281
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,950
wants to suggest to me why these might
be having any effect at all in what's

2282
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:18,960
be having any effect at all in what's
 

2283
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,109
be having any effect at all in what's
going on here?

2284
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:21,119
going on here?
 

2285
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,549
going on here?
>> Um, yeah,

2286
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
>> Um, yeah,
 

2287
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,230
>> Um, yeah,
>> it seems like the the ps are scaling the

2288
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:28,240
>> it seems like the the ps are scaling the
 

2289
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,510
>> it seems like the the ps are scaling the
adjustment to pi so that like the

2290
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:31,520
adjustment to pi so that like the
 

2291
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,549
adjustment to pi so that like the
farther away the p the bigger the loss.

2292
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:36,559
farther away the p the bigger the loss.
 

2293
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,670
farther away the p the bigger the loss.
So um at first glance when you look at

2294
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:39,680
So um at first glance when you look at
 

2295
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,150
So um at first glance when you look at
it because you take this ratio

2296
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:42,160
it because you take this ratio
 

2297
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,829
it because you take this ratio
right it's saying I'm scaling it

2298
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:43,839
right it's saying I'm scaling it
 

2299
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,630
right it's saying I'm scaling it
appropriately to look relative to pyrev

2300
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:46,640
appropriately to look relative to pyrev
 

2301
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,630
appropriately to look relative to pyrev
but that's what this argument is

2302
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:48,640
but that's what this argument is
 

2303
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,910
but that's what this argument is
designed to say maybe not like this

2304
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:51,920
designed to say maybe not like this
 

2305
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,630
designed to say maybe not like this
ratio is inside of the log and the log

2306
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
ratio is inside of the log and the log
 

2307
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,109
ratio is inside of the log and the log
will just break that scaling off into

2308
00:51:57,109 --> 00:51:57,119
will just break that scaling off into
 

2309
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,549
will just break that scaling off into
separate things. So at a level of

2310
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:00,559
separate things. So at a level of
 

2311
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,990
separate things. So at a level of
intuition, yeah, it's definitely doing

2312
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:02,000
intuition, yeah, it's definitely doing
 

2313
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,430
intuition, yeah, it's definitely doing
that, but at a level of intuition for

2314
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:03,440
that, but at a level of intuition for
 

2315
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,950
that, but at a level of intuition for
why that matters, it doesn't answer the

2316
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:04,960
why that matters, it doesn't answer the
 

2317
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,390
why that matters, it doesn't answer the
question because it seems like the log

2318
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,400
question because it seems like the log
 

2319
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,630
question because it seems like the log
is killing all of that.

2320
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,640
is killing all of that.
 

2321
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,470
is killing all of that.
Yeah,

2322
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:10,480
Yeah,
 

2323
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,710
Yeah,
>> I think it's just like a baseline. So

2324
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:12,720
>> I think it's just like a baseline. So
 

2325
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,470
>> I think it's just like a baseline. So
now we have like positive rewards,

2326
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:14,480
now we have like positive rewards,
 

2327
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,950
now we have like positive rewards,
negative.

2328
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:16,960
negative.
 

2329
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,549
negative.
If we don't have that baseline, we will

2330
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:18,559
If we don't have that baseline, we will
 

2331
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,470
If we don't have that baseline, we will
have like all the rewards positive.

2332
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:22,480
have like all the rewards positive.
 

2333
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,230
have like all the rewards positive.
>> So it's the when you say all the words

2334
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:26,240
>> So it's the when you say all the words
 

2335
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,549
>> So it's the when you say all the words
be positive, what do you mean?

2336
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:28,559
be positive, what do you mean?
 

2337
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:40,710
be positive, what do you mean?
like the yusen.

2338
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:40,720

 

2339
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,030

So the the probabilities are positive

2340
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:43,040
So the the probabilities are positive
 

2341
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,790
So the the probabilities are positive
that's fine. The ratio of probabilities

2342
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:44,800
that's fine. The ratio of probabilities
 

2343
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,710
that's fine. The ratio of probabilities
is also positive. So it's still

2344
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:46,720
is also positive. So it's still
 

2345
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,630
is also positive. So it's still
positive.

2346
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:48,640
positive.
 

2347
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,630
positive.
This taking ratios doesn't make it not

2348
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:50,640
This taking ratios doesn't make it not
 

2349
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,870
This taking ratios doesn't make it not
be positive. So that's not that's not

2350
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:54,880
be positive. So that's not that's not
 

2351
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,950
be positive. So that's not that's not
really an explanation. It's true but it

2352
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:56,960
really an explanation. It's true but it
 

2353
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,069
really an explanation. It's true but it
doesn't it doesn't doesn't tell you why

2354
00:52:58,069 --> 00:52:58,079
doesn't it doesn't doesn't tell you why
 

2355
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,190
doesn't it doesn't doesn't tell you why
this is having any effect even at like a

2356
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,200
this is having any effect even at like a
 

2357
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,710
this is having any effect even at like a
at a like basic level.

2358
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:04,720
at a like basic level.
 

2359
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,309
at a like basic level.
>> Yeah.

2360
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:06,319
>> Yeah.
 

2361
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,710
>> Yeah.
>> Um it's inside the signal. So you're

2362
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:08,720
>> Um it's inside the signal. So you're
 

2363
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,710
>> Um it's inside the signal. So you're
doing a subtraction

2364
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:10,720
doing a subtraction
 

2365
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,069
doing a subtraction
difference.

2366
00:53:12,069 --> 00:53:12,079
difference.
 

2367
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,790
difference.
kind of acting like the divergence was.

2368
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:14,800
kind of acting like the divergence was.
 

2369
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,750
kind of acting like the divergence was.
So if it moves too far away from the

2370
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:17,760
So if it moves too far away from the
 

2371
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,309
So if it moves too far away from the
reference policy, the sigmoid will like

2372
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:20,319
reference policy, the sigmoid will like
 

2373
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,349
reference policy, the sigmoid will like
saturate it. So the gradients will be

2374
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:23,359
saturate it. So the gradients will be
 

2375
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,030
saturate it. So the gradients will be
the flatter.

2376
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:25,040
the flatter.
 

2377
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,349
the flatter.
>> Okay, great. So let me just draw a

2378
00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:27,359
>> Okay, great. So let me just draw a
 

2379
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,270
>> Okay, great. So let me just draw a
sigmoid. That's what you're basically

2380
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:29,280
sigmoid. That's what you're basically
 

2381
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,710
sigmoid. That's what you're basically
saying is remember what a sigmoid looks

2382
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:30,720
saying is remember what a sigmoid looks
 

2383
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,829
saying is remember what a sigmoid looks
like.

2384
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:33,839

 

2385
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,190

Okay, sigmoid looks like this. So a

2386
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:37,200
Okay, sigmoid looks like this. So a
 

2387
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,870
Okay, sigmoid looks like this. So a
sigmoid has flat sections. So what this

2388
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
sigmoid has flat sections. So what this
 

2389
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,790
sigmoid has flat sections. So what this
is doing is it's doing something to

2390
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:42,800
is doing is it's doing something to
 

2391
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,990
is doing is it's doing something to
adjust what's happening inside the

2392
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
adjust what's happening inside the
 

2393
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,670
adjust what's happening inside the
sigmoid. And the sigmoid allows for the

2394
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
sigmoid. And the sigmoid allows for the
 

2395
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,990
sigmoid. And the sigmoid allows for the
possibility of saturation

2396
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000
possibility of saturation
 

2397
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,470
possibility of saturation
of what's happening. And indeed that's a

2398
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:50,480
of what's happening. And indeed that's a
 

2399
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,230
of what's happening. And indeed that's a
good way of thinking about it. So if you

2400
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:52,240
good way of thinking about it. So if you
 

2401
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,470
good way of thinking about it. So if you
want to think about it, you can just

2402
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:54,480
want to think about it, you can just
 

2403
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,190
want to think about it, you can just
group these terms a little differently

2404
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:57,200
group these terms a little differently
 

2405
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,349
group these terms a little differently
and say you have something that's

2406
00:53:59,349 --> 00:53:59,359
and say you have something that's
 

2407
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,109
and say you have something that's
comparing

2408
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:01,119
comparing
 

2409
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,950
comparing
the winner to the loser

2410
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:04,960
the winner to the loser
 

2411
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:13,990
the winner to the loser
and you have another

2412
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:14,000

 

2413
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,069

where is the right kind of place to look

2414
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:16,079
where is the right kind of place to look
 

2415
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,510
where is the right kind of place to look
at. So it turns out this the only point

2416
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:19,520
at. So it turns out this the only point
 

2417
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,190
at. So it turns out this the only point
of doing this is to say yeah it could

2418
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:21,200
of doing this is to say yeah it could
 

2419
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,589
of doing this is to say yeah it could
make a difference right this can make a

2420
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:23,599
make a difference right this can make a
 

2421
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,190
make a difference right this can make a
difference because it's going to shift

2422
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:25,200
difference because it's going to shift
 

2423
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,549
difference because it's going to shift
you around inside the sigmoid. Now the

2424
00:54:28,549 --> 00:54:28,559
you around inside the sigmoid. Now the
 

2425
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,630
you around inside the sigmoid. Now the
paper has a nice derivation. I think we

2426
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:30,640
paper has a nice derivation. I think we
 

2427
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,750
paper has a nice derivation. I think we
we'll make you do it in the homework. um

2428
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:33,760
we'll make you do it in the homework. um
 

2429
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,870
we'll make you do it in the homework. um
says if you look at this guy and

2430
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:36,880
says if you look at this guy and
 

2431
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,470
says if you look at this guy and
actually take the gradient and take

2432
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:38,480
actually take the gradient and take
 

2433
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,829
actually take the gradient and take
advantage of the properties of the

2434
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:39,839
advantage of the properties of the
 

2435
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,510
advantage of the properties of the
gradients of sigmoids and the gradients

2436
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:41,520
gradients of sigmoids and the gradients
 

2437
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,309
gradients of sigmoids and the gradients
of logs and stuff like this you get that

2438
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:44,319
of logs and stuff like this you get that
 

2439
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,150
of logs and stuff like this you get that
the expression

2440
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:46,160
the expression
 

2441
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,630
the expression
um over here if you take the gradient of

2442
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:48,640
um over here if you take the gradient of
 

2443
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,950
um over here if you take the gradient of
it it turns into a term which is

2444
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:52,960
it it turns into a term which is
 

2445
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,030
it it turns into a term which is
increase the probability of the winner

2446
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:55,040
increase the probability of the winner
 

2447
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,710
increase the probability of the winner
and a term that says decrease the

2448
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:56,720
and a term that says decrease the
 

2449
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,870
and a term that says decrease the
probability of the loser as we had

2450
00:54:58,870 --> 00:54:58,880
probability of the loser as we had
 

2451
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:05,109
probability of the loser as we had
before but it has a waiting on it

2452
00:55:05,109 --> 00:55:05,119
before but it has a waiting on it
 

2453
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,710
before but it has a waiting on it
says

2454
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:06,720
says
 

2455
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,870
says
I'm doing the sigmoid

2456
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:10,880

 

2457
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,630

sigmoid of this difference when when

2458
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
sigmoid of this difference when when
 

2459
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,510
sigmoid of this difference when when
this difference is large and positive

2460
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:15,520
this difference is large and positive
 

2461
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,950
this difference is large and positive
it says do this

2462
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
it says do this
 

2463
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,230
it says do this
but when the difference is

2464
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:22,240
but when the difference is
 

2465
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,630
but when the difference is
negative

2466
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:24,640
negative
 

2467
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,069
negative
it's saying yeah saturate this out and

2468
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:28,079
it's saying yeah saturate this out and
 

2469
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,950
it's saying yeah saturate this out and
basically don't do this I don't need to

2470
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:30,960
basically don't do this I don't need to
 

2471
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,589
basically don't do this I don't need to
adjust these

2472
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:33,599

 

2473
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,750

Okay. And

2474
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:35,760
Okay. And
 

2475
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,710
Okay. And
the final issue in DPO why the paper

2476
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:38,720
the final issue in DPO why the paper
 

2477
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,589
the final issue in DPO why the paper
gets its title at all is it's saying

2478
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
gets its title at all is it's saying
 

2479
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,390
gets its title at all is it's saying
that if I think about this as a I can

2480
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:44,400
that if I think about this as a I can
 

2481
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,950
that if I think about this as a I can
think of this as a reward estimate and

2482
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:46,960
think of this as a reward estimate and
 

2483
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,030
think of this as a reward estimate and
it says what does a model think is good

2484
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:51,040
it says what does a model think is good
 

2485
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,270
it says what does a model think is good
and the answer is models think things

2486
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:53,280
and the answer is models think things
 

2487
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,950
and the answer is models think things
are good if they like to generate them.

2488
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:56,960
are good if they like to generate them.
 

2489
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,950
are good if they like to generate them.
That's it. you treat the probability of

2490
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:58,960
That's it. you treat the probability of
 

2491
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,710
That's it. you treat the probability of
the model generating something as a

2492
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:00,720
the model generating something as a
 

2493
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,030
the model generating something as a
reward model as as a reward model. So

2494
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:03,040
reward model as as a reward model. So
 

2495
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,270
reward model as as a reward model. So
high probability things are deemed good,

2496
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:05,280
high probability things are deemed good,
 

2497
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,750
high probability things are deemed good,
low probability things are deemed bad

2498
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:07,760
low probability things are deemed bad
 

2499
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,549
low probability things are deemed bad
and that's it and you can just work with

2500
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:10,559
and that's it and you can just work with
 

2501
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,230
and that's it and you can just work with
that.

2502
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:12,240
that.
 

2503
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,870
that.
So this thing uh very brief view of uh

2504
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:16,880
So this thing uh very brief view of uh
 

2505
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,030
So this thing uh very brief view of uh
of DPO but this had a huge effect um

2506
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,040
of DPO but this had a huge effect um
 

2507
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,829
of DPO but this had a huge effect um
practically because this was simple

2508
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:23,839
practically because this was simple
 

2509
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,549
practically because this was simple
enough to do and you didn't have to do a

2510
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:26,559
enough to do and you didn't have to do a
 

2511
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,230
enough to do and you didn't have to do a
bunch of generations and have to train a

2512
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:28,240
bunch of generations and have to train a
 

2513
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,549
bunch of generations and have to train a
reward model at all and

2514
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:32,559
reward model at all and
 

2515
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,789
reward model at all and
as a result people could take data sets

2516
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:34,799
as a result people could take data sets
 

2517
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,829
as a result people could take data sets
that they would handcraft or kind of

2518
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:37,839
that they would handcraft or kind of
 

2519
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,710
that they would handcraft or kind of
interrogate other models to generate

2520
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:40,720
interrogate other models to generate
 

2521
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,470
interrogate other models to generate
data sets and use them to fine-tune

2522
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:42,480
data sets and use them to fine-tune
 

2523
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,270
data sets and use them to fine-tune
other different models and it created a

2524
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:45,280
other different models and it created a
 

2525
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,950
other different models and it created a
whole cottage industry of people doing

2526
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:48,960
whole cottage industry of people doing
 

2527
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,470
whole cottage industry of people doing
all kinds of fine-tunes without having

2528
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:50,480
all kinds of fine-tunes without having
 

2529
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,910
all kinds of fine-tunes without having
to do full RL with uh reward models and

2530
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:53,920
to do full RL with uh reward models and
 

2531
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,990
to do full RL with uh reward models and
people implemented it. There's like

2532
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:56,000
people implemented it. There's like
 

2533
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,829
people implemented it. There's like
companies and libraries out there that

2534
00:56:57,829 --> 00:56:57,839
companies and libraries out there that
 

2535
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,030
companies and libraries out there that
you can use. You can basically do it on

2536
00:56:59,030 --> 00:56:59,040
you can use. You can basically do it on
 

2537
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,510
you can use. You can basically do it on
a collab notebook now finetune a model

2538
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:01,520
a collab notebook now finetune a model
 

2539
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,309
a collab notebook now finetune a model
using DPL.

2540
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:04,319
using DPL.
 

2541
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:08,390
using DPL.
So uh to show you this is not uh an area

2542
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:08,400
So uh to show you this is not uh an area
 

2543
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,390
So uh to show you this is not uh an area
which is that's the final word things

2544
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:10,400
which is that's the final word things
 

2545
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,190
which is that's the final word things
keep going. So the third I would

2546
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:13,200
keep going. So the third I would
 

2547
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,349
keep going. So the third I would
consider kind of important idea in this

2548
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:15,359
consider kind of important idea in this
 

2549
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,750
consider kind of important idea in this
gener in this kind of sequence of work

2550
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:17,760
gener in this kind of sequence of work
 

2551
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,910
gener in this kind of sequence of work
was to say

2552
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:21,920

 

2553
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,510

maybe instead of just having the

2554
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:23,520
maybe instead of just having the
 

2555
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,190
maybe instead of just having the
reference policy start at the reference

2556
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,200
reference policy start at the reference
 

2557
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,270
reference policy start at the reference
policy that said upweight the winners

2558
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:31,280
policy that said upweight the winners
 

2559
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,030
policy that said upweight the winners
you every some number of iterations say

2560
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:35,040
you every some number of iterations say
 

2561
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,670
you every some number of iterations say
I have a new reference policy namely the

2562
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:37,680
I have a new reference policy namely the
 

2563
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:41,109
I have a new reference policy namely the
policy that I just trained.

2564
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:41,119
policy that I just trained.
 

2565
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,510
policy that I just trained.
Okay, so this is the TRDPO idea. This

2566
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:43,520
Okay, so this is the TRDPO idea. This
 

2567
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,549
Okay, so this is the TRDPO idea. This
came out in I ICLR

2568
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
came out in I ICLR
 

2569
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,630
came out in I ICLR
this year. Um, and basically every like

2570
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:50,640
this year. Um, and basically every like
 

2571
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,309
this year. Um, and basically every like
512ish

2572
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:52,319
512ish
 

2573
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,510
512ish
training steps say, okay, I have a new

2574
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:55,520
training steps say, okay, I have a new
 

2575
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,910
training steps say, okay, I have a new
reference policy. It's the current one.

2576
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920
reference policy. It's the current one.
 

2577
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,789
reference policy. It's the current one.
This seems to work even better

2578
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:02,799
This seems to work even better
 

2579
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,549
This seems to work even better
by allowing things to adjust. And

2580
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:04,559
by allowing things to adjust. And
 

2581
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:05,750
by allowing things to adjust. And
there's like good reasons for it. You

2582
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:05,760
there's like good reasons for it. You
 

2583
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,190
there's like good reasons for it. You
can read the papers. It's very nice to

2584
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,200
can read the papers. It's very nice to
 

2585
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,510
can read the papers. It's very nice to
hear to think about why it's doing this.

2586
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:09,520
hear to think about why it's doing this.
 

2587
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,030
hear to think about why it's doing this.
Um

2588
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,040
Um
 

2589
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,990
Um
but this is uh kind of what's in DPO

2590
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,000
but this is uh kind of what's in DPO
 

2591
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,710
but this is uh kind of what's in DPO
land. Uh so between the DPO ideas reward

2592
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:18,720
land. Uh so between the DPO ideas reward
 

2593
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,470
land. Uh so between the DPO ideas reward
modeling um with RHF you kind of now

2594
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:22,480
modeling um with RHF you kind of now
 

2595
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,230
modeling um with RHF you kind of now
have a full perspective on what's going

2596
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:24,240
have a full perspective on what's going
 

2597
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,270
have a full perspective on what's going
on with the post training of models

2598
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,280
on with the post training of models
 

2599
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,390
on with the post training of models
using RL ideas

2600
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:30,400
using RL ideas
 

2601
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,829
using RL ideas
as an introduction meaning you can now

2602
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:31,839
as an introduction meaning you can now
 

2603
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,829
as an introduction meaning you can now
start reading the papers and look and

2604
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:33,839
start reading the papers and look and
 

2605
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:35,349
start reading the papers and look and
read and understand things as you need

2606
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:35,359
read and understand things as you need
 

2607
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:38,549
read and understand things as you need
to.

2608
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:38,559

 

2609
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:45,829

Okay, any questions on this?

2610
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:45,839

 

2611
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,190

Okay, great. So now I'm going to switch

2612
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:49,200
Okay, great. So now I'm going to switch
 

2613
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,630
Okay, great. So now I'm going to switch
topics. So now I'm going to talk about

2614
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:50,640
topics. So now I'm going to talk about
 

2615
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,309
topics. So now I'm going to talk about
diffusion models for generation.

2616
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:54,319
diffusion models for generation.
 

2617
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:58,309
diffusion models for generation.
So that was the um RL

2618
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
So that was the um RL
 

2619
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,109
So that was the um RL
uh post-training interlude return back

2620
00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:01,119
uh post-training interlude return back
 

2621
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,870
uh post-training interlude return back
to generative models.

2622
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:04,880

 

2623
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,470

So

2624
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:06,480
So
 

2625
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,230
So
it's interesting because you can think

2626
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:08,240
it's interesting because you can think
 

2627
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,430
it's interesting because you can think
about diffusion models for generation as

2628
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:11,440
about diffusion models for generation as
 

2629
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,870
about diffusion models for generation as
a kind of test time compute relative to

2630
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:14,880
a kind of test time compute relative to
 

2631
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,349
a kind of test time compute relative to
a VAE. Okay, so think about a VAE. You

2632
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:19,359
a VAE. Okay, so think about a VAE. You
 

2633
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,349
a VAE. Okay, so think about a VAE. You
train a VAE for doing generation. You do

2634
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:21,359
train a VAE for doing generation. You do
 

2635
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:22,870
train a VAE for doing generation. You do
a bunch of training, but then when you

2636
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:22,880
a bunch of training, but then when you
 

2637
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,190
a bunch of training, but then when you
have to do a generation, you draw a

2638
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:25,200
have to do a generation, you draw a
 

2639
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,349
have to do a generation, you draw a
random Gaussian,

2640
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:27,359
random Gaussian,
 

2641
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,230
random Gaussian,
shove it into your decoder and say what

2642
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:30,240
shove it into your decoder and say what
 

2643
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,990
shove it into your decoder and say what
comes out.

2644
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:32,000
comes out.
 

2645
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,670
comes out.
One shot.

2646
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:33,680
One shot.
 

2647
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,069
One shot.
everyone there. Other techniques are

2648
00:59:36,069 --> 00:59:36,079
everyone there. Other techniques are
 

2649
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,870
everyone there. Other techniques are
also of that flavor. Um there's things

2650
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:38,880
also of that flavor. Um there's things
 

2651
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,230
also of that flavor. Um there's things
called GANs which we're not going to

2652
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:40,240
called GANs which we're not going to
 

2653
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,150
called GANs which we're not going to
talk about this term um because of time

2654
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:44,160
talk about this term um because of time
 

2655
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,990
talk about this term um because of time
uh where you also do different ways of

2656
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:46,000
uh where you also do different ways of
 

2657
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,589
uh where you also do different ways of
training but then you take a model you

2658
00:59:47,589 --> 00:59:47,599
training but then you take a model you
 

2659
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,190
training but then you take a model you
shove in noise and out comes a

2660
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:49,200
shove in noise and out comes a
 

2661
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,710
shove in noise and out comes a
generation and that's it.

2662
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:52,720
generation and that's it.
 

2663
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,190
generation and that's it.
Diffusion models as well as auto

2664
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:55,200
Diffusion models as well as auto
 

2665
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,549
Diffusion models as well as auto
reggressive models they think some

2666
00:59:58,549 --> 00:59:58,559
reggressive models they think some
 

2667
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,789
reggressive models they think some
amount of time before they give a model

2668
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:00,799
amount of time before they give a model
 

2669
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,950
amount of time before they give a model
up output out. So do things over and

2670
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:02,960
up output out. So do things over and
 

2671
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,470
up output out. So do things over and
over again. So you've already seen this

2672
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:04,480
over again. So you've already seen this
 

2673
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,309
over again. So you've already seen this
in auto reggressive generation. So in

2674
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:06,319
in auto reggressive generation. So in
 

2675
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,549
in auto reggressive generation. So in
auto reggressive generation instead of

2676
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:08,559
auto reggressive generation instead of
 

2677
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,789
auto reggressive generation instead of
doing the generation one sentence or

2678
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:10,799
doing the generation one sentence or
 

2679
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,030
doing the generation one sentence or
sequence at a time, you do it one chunk

2680
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:13,040
sequence at a time, you do it one chunk
 

2681
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,670
sequence at a time, you do it one chunk
or token at a time. Right? In images

2682
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:15,680
or token at a time. Right? In images
 

2683
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,670
or token at a time. Right? In images
it's by patches.

2684
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:17,680
it's by patches.
 

2685
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,230
it's by patches.
And so what you do is the during

2686
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:20,240
And so what you do is the during
 

2687
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,230
And so what you do is the during
training you learn a conditional

2688
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
training you learn a conditional
 

2689
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,990
training you learn a conditional
distribution

2690
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:24,000
distribution
 

2691
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,549
distribution
and then you do the generation with

2692
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:26,559
and then you do the generation with
 

2693
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,270
and then you do the generation with
sampling one step at a time. So as

2694
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,280
sampling one step at a time. So as
 

2695
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,549
sampling one step at a time. So as
you're doing the generation you're

2696
01:00:30,549 --> 01:00:30,559
you're doing the generation you're
 

2697
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,870
you're doing the generation you're
introducing randomness and keep moving.

2698
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:34,880
introducing randomness and keep moving.
 

2699
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,470
introducing randomness and keep moving.
Okay, everyone cool with this kind of

2700
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:36,480
Okay, everyone cool with this kind of
 

2701
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,670
Okay, everyone cool with this kind of
perspective and auto reggressive

2702
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,680
perspective and auto reggressive
 

2703
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,230
perspective and auto reggressive
generation.

2704
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:40,240
generation.
 

2705
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,270
generation.
So to do this and it was most natural to

2706
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:43,280
So to do this and it was most natural to
 

2707
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,069
So to do this and it was most natural to
do this in cases where the training data

2708
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:46,079
do this in cases where the training data
 

2709
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,549
do this in cases where the training data
itself has an inherent sequentiality to

2710
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:48,559
itself has an inherent sequentiality to
 

2711
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,589
itself has an inherent sequentiality to
it. So you can train to learn what comes

2712
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:51,599
it. So you can train to learn what comes
 

2713
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,630
it. So you can train to learn what comes
next.

2714
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:56,640

 

2715
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,670

So now diffusion models one way of

2716
01:00:59,670 --> 01:00:59,680
So now diffusion models one way of
 

2717
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,589
So now diffusion models one way of
thinking about them is to say I would

2718
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:01,599
thinking about them is to say I would
 

2719
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,470
thinking about them is to say I would
like to spend effort while doing the

2720
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:04,480
like to spend effort while doing the
 

2721
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,390
like to spend effort while doing the
generation not just have to do it in one

2722
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:06,400
generation not just have to do it in one
 

2723
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,390
generation not just have to do it in one
shot

2724
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:08,400
shot
 

2725
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,589
shot
but my pro my domain doesn't necessarily

2726
01:01:11,589 --> 01:01:11,599
but my pro my domain doesn't necessarily
 

2727
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,470
but my pro my domain doesn't necessarily
have inherent sequentiality like images

2728
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:14,480
have inherent sequentiality like images
 

2729
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,390
have inherent sequentiality like images
an image doesn't you can you can make an

2730
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,400
an image doesn't you can you can make an
 

2731
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,390
an image doesn't you can you can make an
image sequential in many different ways

2732
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:18,400
image sequential in many different ways
 

2733
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,470
image sequential in many different ways
you can raster scan the image you can

2734
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
you can raster scan the image you can
 

2735
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,630
you can raster scan the image you can
space filling curve through an image you

the image right you can do lots of

2746
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:34,240
the image right you can do lots of
 

2747
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,910
the image right you can do lots of
things for an image to try to make it be

01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:35,920
things for an image to try to make it be
 

2749
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,589
things for an image to try to make it be
sequential but it isn't

2750
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:39,599
sequential but it isn't
 

2751
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,910
sequential but it isn't
it's something you're imposing right

2752
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:41,920
it's something you're imposing right
 

2753
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:47,750
it's something you're imposing right
image really is all at once

2754
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:47,760

 

2755
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,789

if you recall from lecture 18 we talked

2756
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:50,799
if you recall from lecture 18 we talked
 

2757
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,549
if you recall from lecture 18 we talked
about ideas that didn't work for doing

2758
01:01:52,549 --> 01:01:52,559
about ideas that didn't work for doing
 

2759
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,150
about ideas that didn't work for doing
generation and we already had a kind of

2760
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,160
generation and we already had a kind of
 

2761
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,270
generation and we already had a kind of
test time compute idea which didn't work

2762
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:57,280
test time compute idea which didn't work
 

2763
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,069
test time compute idea which didn't work
which was to say

2764
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:00,079
which was to say
 

2765
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,430
which was to say
remember we said one way you could

2766
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:01,440
remember we said one way you could
 

2767
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,670
remember we said one way you could
imagine doing it is to use a cat

2768
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:03,680
imagine doing it is to use a cat
 

2769
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,990
imagine doing it is to use a cat
classifier and just pick random noise

2770
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,000
classifier and just pick random noise
 

2771
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,829
classifier and just pick random noise
and gradient ascent that's the test time

2772
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
and gradient ascent that's the test time
 

2773
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,510
and gradient ascent that's the test time
compute

2774
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:09,520
compute
 

2775
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,109
compute
right on the cat score but if you did

2776
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:13,119
right on the cat score but if you did
 

2777
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,549
right on the cat score but if you did
this we told you you wouldn't get a

2778
01:02:14,549 --> 01:02:14,559
this we told you you wouldn't get a
 

2779
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,630
this we told you you wouldn't get a
picture of a cat

2780
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:16,640
picture of a cat
 

2781
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,109
picture of a cat
right and we identified the challenge as

2782
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:19,119
right and we identified the challenge as
 

2783
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:22,309
right and we identified the challenge as
being the fact that there's all possible

2784
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:22,319
being the fact that there's all possible
 

2785
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,430
being the fact that there's all possible
images in the sense of pixel arrays. And

2786
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:25,440
images in the sense of pixel arrays. And
 

2787
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,109
images in the sense of pixel arrays. And
then there's the manifold of natural

2788
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:27,119
then there's the manifold of natural
 

2789
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,470
then there's the manifold of natural
images, which is a much lower

2790
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
images, which is a much lower
 

2791
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,349
images, which is a much lower
dimensional object.

2792
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
dimensional object.
 

2793
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,910
dimensional object.
And

2794
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:33,920
And
 

2795
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,309
And
the cat classifier was only trained on

2796
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:36,319
the cat classifier was only trained on
 

2797
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,710
the cat classifier was only trained on
this stuff.

2798
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
this stuff.
 

2799
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,349
this stuff.
And if you shove in something over here,

2800
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:41,359
And if you shove in something over here,
 

2801
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:43,349
And if you shove in something over here,
it's like well out of its distribution.

2802
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:43,359
it's like well out of its distribution.
 

2803
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,789
it's like well out of its distribution.
So gradient descent on isn't going to

2804
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:44,799
So gradient descent on isn't going to
 

2805
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,510
So gradient descent on isn't going to
get you someplace nice.

2806
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:47,520
get you someplace nice.
 

2807
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,190
get you someplace nice.
Everyone remember bring this stuff back

2808
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:49,200
Everyone remember bring this stuff back
 

2809
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,109
Everyone remember bring this stuff back
into memory.

2810
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
into memory.
 

2811
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,109
into memory.
So you can think of diffusion models as

2812
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:53,119
So you can think of diffusion models as
 

2813
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,309
So you can think of diffusion models as
trying to make this kind of idea work.

2814
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:56,319
trying to make this kind of idea work.
 

2815
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:00,470
trying to make this kind of idea work.
Okay, in spirit.

2816
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:00,480

 

2817
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,349

So

2818
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:03,359
So
 

2819
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,510
So
remember in that lecture we started with

2820
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:05,520
remember in that lecture we started with
 

2821
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,349
remember in that lecture we started with
we had this classifier idea and then we

2822
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
we had this classifier idea and then we
 

2823
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,670
we had this classifier idea and then we
had the autoenccoder idea and then we

2824
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:09,680
had the autoenccoder idea and then we
 

2825
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,630
had the autoenccoder idea and then we
made the autoenccoder idea work by using

2826
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:12,640
made the autoenccoder idea work by using
 

2827
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,870
made the autoenccoder idea work by using
the VAE idea.

2828
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:14,880
the VAE idea.
 

2829
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,710
the VAE idea.
So we want to see if we can do that same

2830
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:16,720
So we want to see if we can do that same
 

2831
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:20,710
So we want to see if we can do that same
kind of move on this idea. So what does

2832
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:20,720
kind of move on this idea. So what does
 

2833
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,510
kind of move on this idea. So what does
that how does that look?

2834
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:23,520
that how does that look?
 

2835
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,750
that how does that look?
So the key insight we have from the VA

2836
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:27,760
So the key insight we have from the VA
 

2837
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,870
So the key insight we have from the VA
story was

2838
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:30,880
story was
 

2839
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,470
story was
you can't ask a model to work on

2840
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:34,480
you can't ask a model to work on
 

2841
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,990
you can't ask a model to work on
something very far from its

2842
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:36,000
something very far from its
 

2843
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,870
something very far from its
distribution. And so in the VAE we

2844
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
distribution. And so in the VAE we
 

2845
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,430
distribution. And so in the VAE we
wanted the decoder to be robust and to

2846
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:41,440
wanted the decoder to be robust and to
 

2847
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,349
wanted the decoder to be robust and to
see things that were more noise-like.

2848
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:43,359
see things that were more noise-like.
 

2849
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,549
see things that were more noise-like.
And so we had noisy things appear during

2850
01:03:46,549 --> 01:03:46,559
And so we had noisy things appear during
 

2851
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,309
And so we had noisy things appear during
training.

2852
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
training.
 

2853
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,309
training.
So now the question is we need to

2854
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:50,319
So now the question is we need to
 

2855
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:52,390
So now the question is we need to
somehow have noisy things appear during

2856
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:52,400
somehow have noisy things appear during
 

2857
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,870
somehow have noisy things appear during
training for this idea of taking

2858
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:54,880
training for this idea of taking
 

2859
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,670
training for this idea of taking
something out in very noisy land and

2860
01:03:59,670 --> 01:03:59,680
something out in very noisy land and
 

2861
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,029
something out in very noisy land and
making it move towards this thing. Okay,

2862
01:04:03,029 --> 01:04:03,039
making it move towards this thing. Okay,
 

2863
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,470
making it move towards this thing. Okay,
that's our goal trying to follow the

2864
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:04,480
that's our goal trying to follow the
 

2865
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,390
that's our goal trying to follow the
idea of start out here move towards

2866
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:06,400
idea of start out here move towards
 

2867
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,549
idea of start out here move towards
here.

2868
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:10,559

 

2869
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,670

So now this is like the question how

2870
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:13,680
So now this is like the question how
 

2871
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,230
So now this is like the question how
noisy should it be

2872
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:16,240
noisy should it be
 

2873
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,710
noisy should it be
for the VAE? We said look we're going to

2874
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
for the VAE? We said look we're going to
 

2875
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,349
for the VAE? We said look we're going to
have a kale regularizer term. We will

2876
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:21,359
have a kale regularizer term. We will
 

2877
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,150
have a kale regularizer term. We will
set up a noise amount and we will kind

2878
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:24,160
set up a noise amount and we will kind
 

2879
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,750
set up a noise amount and we will kind
of optimize this the tension between

2880
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:25,760
of optimize this the tension between
 

2881
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,069
of optimize this the tension between
reconstruction loss and how noisy things

2882
01:04:28,069 --> 01:04:28,079
reconstruction loss and how noisy things
 

2883
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,630
reconstruction loss and how noisy things
are. And we ask it to balance that

2884
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:30,640
are. And we ask it to balance that
 

2885
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,309
are. And we ask it to balance that
through our hyperparameter choice.

2886
01:04:34,309 --> 01:04:34,319
through our hyperparameter choice.
 

2887
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:36,150
through our hyperparameter choice.
This feels different. So what should we

2888
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:36,160
This feels different. So what should we
 

2889
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,950
This feels different. So what should we
do? So here I want to point out that

2890
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:38,960
do? So here I want to point out that
 

2891
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,109
do? So here I want to point out that
there's two extremes are very clear.

2892
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
there's two extremes are very clear.
 

2893
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,390
there's two extremes are very clear.
Okay, which is

2894
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:46,400
Okay, which is
 

2895
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,829
Okay, which is
since we're definitely going to start

2896
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:47,839
since we're definitely going to start
 

2897
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:50,630
since we're definitely going to start
with stuff that's very noisy,

2898
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:50,640
with stuff that's very noisy,
 

2899
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,470
with stuff that's very noisy,
we we should see very noisy things

2900
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:52,480
we we should see very noisy things
 

2901
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,630
we we should see very noisy things
during training. Everyone with me? So,

2902
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:54,640
during training. Everyone with me? So,
 

2903
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,789
during training. Everyone with me? So,
we have to see very noisy things. At

2904
01:04:56,789 --> 01:04:56,799
we have to see very noisy things. At
 

2905
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:59,589
we have to see very noisy things. At
some point, we're taking steps, right?

2906
01:04:59,589 --> 01:04:59,599
some point, we're taking steps, right?
 

2907
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,430
some point, we're taking steps, right?
And we're going to end up here. So, we

2908
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:01,440
And we're going to end up here. So, we
 

2909
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,349
And we're going to end up here. So, we
have to see things that are basically

2910
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:03,359
have to see things that are basically
 

2911
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,109
have to see things that are basically
clean.

2912
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:05,119
clean.
 

2913
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,150
clean.
These two extremes are required

2914
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:08,160
These two extremes are required
 

2915
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,069
These two extremes are required
for the story of trying to get start

2916
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:10,079
for the story of trying to get start
 

2917
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,390
for the story of trying to get start
somewhere and then move towards natural

2918
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:12,400
somewhere and then move towards natural
 

2919
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,950
somewhere and then move towards natural
images. So the question becomes what

2920
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:14,960
images. So the question becomes what
 

2921
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,950
images. So the question becomes what
else? So here is where I thought a meme

2922
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:16,960
else? So here is where I thought a meme
 

2923
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,630
else? So here is where I thought a meme
would be useful. Okay,

2924
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
would be useful. Okay,
 

2925
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,270
would be useful. Okay,
so

2926
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:23,280
so
 

2927
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,349
so
total noise

2928
01:05:25,349 --> 01:05:25,359
total noise
 

2929
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,990
total noise
somehow clean desired samples. The

2930
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,000
somehow clean desired samples. The
 

2931
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,829
somehow clean desired samples. The
question is what goes here?

2932
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:31,839
question is what goes here?
 

2933
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,390
question is what goes here?
So

2934
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
So
 

2935
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,630
So
if you think of it this way, there's

2936
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:36,640
if you think of it this way, there's
 

2937
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,829
if you think of it this way, there's
actually a natural bridge,

2938
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:39,839
actually a natural bridge,
 

2939
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,630
actually a natural bridge,
okay? That goes between

2940
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:42,640
okay? That goes between
 

2941
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,430
okay? That goes between
total noise and something clean, which

2942
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:45,440
total noise and something clean, which
 

2943
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,069
total noise and something clean, which
is everything in between, okay? Right?

2944
01:05:50,069 --> 01:05:50,079
is everything in between, okay? Right?
 

2945
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,630
is everything in between, okay? Right?
You there's there's not like you have

2946
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:52,640
You there's there's not like you have
 

2947
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,549
You there's there's not like you have
only

2948
01:05:56,549 --> 01:05:56,559

 

2949
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:59,829

out here and this place.

2950
01:05:59,829 --> 01:05:59,839
out here and this place.
 

2951
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:03,430
out here and this place.
You can add noise to here and get

2952
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:03,440
You can add noise to here and get
 

2953
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,150
You can add noise to here and get
nearby. You can add more noise to here

2954
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:06,160
nearby. You can add more noise to here
 

2955
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,470
nearby. You can add more noise to here
and get further out. You can kind of

2956
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:08,480
and get further out. You can kind of
 

2957
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:16,870
and get further out. You can kind of
draw around here

2958
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:16,880

 

2959
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,630

like

2960
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:18,640
like
 

2961
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,950
like
increasingly

2962
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:20,960
increasingly
 

2963
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,309
increasingly
noisy

2964
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:24,319

 

2965
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:27,029

blobs

2966
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:27,039
blobs
 

2967
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,029
blobs
around natural images by adding more

2968
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:29,039
around natural images by adding more
 

2969
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,910
around natural images by adding more
noise. So if you think in training you

2970
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:31,920
noise. So if you think in training you
 

2971
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,910
noise. So if you think in training you
want to see everything and you expect

2972
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:33,920
want to see everything and you expect
 

2973
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,670
want to see everything and you expect
that somehow during the generation

2974
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:35,680
that somehow during the generation
 

2975
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,270
that somehow during the generation
you're going to start far away and then

2976
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:37,280
you're going to start far away and then
 

2977
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,910
you're going to start far away and then
move towards natural images

2978
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:39,920
move towards natural images
 

2979
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,910
move towards natural images
you can train on all of that by just

2980
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:41,920
you can train on all of that by just
 

2981
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,470
you can train on all of that by just
adjusting the amount of noise you add.

2982
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:44,480
adjusting the amount of noise you add.
 

2983
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,470
adjusting the amount of noise you add.
That's like an idea. So far we don't

2984
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:46,480
That's like an idea. So far we don't
 

2985
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,510
That's like an idea. So far we don't
have a technique. We don't have an

2986
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:47,520
have a technique. We don't have an
 

2987
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,870
have a technique. We don't have an
approach to do it. We just have

2988
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:48,880
approach to do it. We just have
 

2989
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,190
approach to do it. We just have
ingredients that we want to use.

2990
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:53,200

 

2991
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,829

So if you look in there's a nice figure

2992
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:55,839
So if you look in there's a nice figure
 

2993
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,670
So if you look in there's a nice figure
in Prince which kind of describes what

2994
01:06:57,670 --> 01:06:57,680
in Prince which kind of describes what
 

2995
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,710
in Prince which kind of describes what
you're trying to do is somehow during

2996
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:00,720
you're trying to do is somehow during
 

2997
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,710
you're trying to do is somehow during
training you're going to have things

2998
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:02,720
training you're going to have things
 

2999
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,190
training you're going to have things
that are going to be differently noisy

3000
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:05,200
that are going to be differently noisy
 

3001
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,750
that are going to be differently noisy
all the way up to fully noise and then

3002
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:07,760
all the way up to fully noise and then
 

3003
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,470
all the way up to fully noise and then
during actual operations you're going to

3004
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:10,480
during actual operations you're going to
 

3005
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,190
during actual operations you're going to
somehow start with noise and then move

3006
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:13,200
somehow start with noise and then move
 

3007
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,470
somehow start with noise and then move
towards images. This is just the idea I

3008
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:16,480
towards images. This is just the idea I
 

3009
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,589
towards images. This is just the idea I
described except in pictures.

3010
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:19,599
described except in pictures.
 

3011
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:23,670
described except in pictures.
Still no details.

3012
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:23,680

 

3013
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,549

Okay. So now

3014
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:26,559
Okay. So now
 

3015
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,029
Okay. So now
I want to

3016
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:29,039
I want to
 

3017
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,789
I want to
contrast the way I'm going to talk about

3018
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:30,799
contrast the way I'm going to talk about
 

3019
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:34,470
contrast the way I'm going to talk about
it with the way in Prince. You can read

3020
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:34,480
it with the way in Prince. You can read
 

3021
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,950
it with the way in Prince. You can read
the work in prints. It's reasonably well

3022
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:36,960
the work in prints. It's reasonably well
 

3023
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,750
the work in prints. It's reasonably well
written. It's good and it follows the

3024
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:39,760
written. It's good and it follows the
 

3025
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,549
written. It's good and it follows the
traditional perspective from this paper

3026
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:42,559
traditional perspective from this paper
 

3027
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,549
traditional perspective from this paper
um by Soul Dix at all. I know actually

3028
01:07:44,549 --> 01:07:44,559
um by Soul Dix at all. I know actually
 

3029
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:47,190
um by Soul Dix at all. I know actually
know the last author um from way back

3030
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:47,200
know the last author um from way back
 

3031
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,349
know the last author um from way back
undergrad days. um

3032
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
undergrad days. um
 

3033
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,349
undergrad days. um
which is called deep unsupervised

3034
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:53,359
which is called deep unsupervised
 

3035
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,910
which is called deep unsupervised
learning using non-equilibrium

3036
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:55,920
learning using non-equilibrium
 

3037
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,029
learning using non-equilibrium
thermodynamics and this appeared in ICML

3038
01:07:59,029 --> 01:07:59,039
thermodynamics and this appeared in ICML
 

3039
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,390
thermodynamics and this appeared in ICML
2015. I'll make the connection to

3040
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:00,400
2015. I'll make the connection to
 

3041
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,190
2015. I'll make the connection to
non-equilibrium thermodynamics in a

3042
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:03,200
non-equilibrium thermodynamics in a
 

3043
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,510
non-equilibrium thermodynamics in a
moment.

3044
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520
moment.
 

3045
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,109
moment.
Um

3046
01:08:07,109 --> 01:08:07,119
Um
 

3047
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,589
Um
and what

3048
01:08:09,589 --> 01:08:09,599
and what
 

3049
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,190
and what
this involves is like how do you

3050
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:11,200
this involves is like how do you
 

3051
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,789
this involves is like how do you
generate stuff that goes from

3052
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:14,799
generate stuff that goes from
 

3053
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,910
generate stuff that goes from
clean to very noisy? And the approach in

3054
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:17,920
clean to very noisy? And the approach in
 

3055
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,910
clean to very noisy? And the approach in
the paper and also practically important

3056
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:19,920
the paper and also practically important
 

3057
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,470
the paper and also practically important
and interesting is

3058
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:22,480
and interesting is
 

3059
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,829
and interesting is
if you want to make an image more noisy,

3060
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
if you want to make an image more noisy,
 

3061
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,110
if you want to make an image more noisy,
you add noise to it. But if you add

3062
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:29,120
you add noise to it. But if you add
 

3063
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,229
you add noise to it. But if you add
noise to it using real numbers, what

3064
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:32,239
noise to it using real numbers, what
 

3065
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:33,749
noise to it using real numbers, what
will happen is you will start with

3066
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:33,759
will happen is you will start with
 

3067
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,309
will happen is you will start with
something that's small and you will get

3068
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:36,319
something that's small and you will get
 

3069
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,630
something that's small and you will get
something that's big. And we already

3070
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:38,640
something that's big. And we already
 

3071
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,870
something that's big. And we already
told you that in deep learning you

3072
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:40,880
told you that in deep learning you
 

3073
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,950
told you that in deep learning you
cannot have wide variations of dynamic

3074
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:42,960
cannot have wide variations of dynamic
 

3075
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:48,149
cannot have wide variations of dynamic
range. That's not okay. So it says scale

3076
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:48,159
range. That's not okay. So it says scale
 

3077
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:51,510
range. That's not okay. So it says scale
along the way. Scale things down and

3078
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:51,520
along the way. Scale things down and
 

3079
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,110
along the way. Scale things down and
then add noise and then keep doing this.

3080
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:55,120
then add noise and then keep doing this.
 

3081
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,590
then add noise and then keep doing this.
Eventually you will scale the actual

3082
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:57,600
Eventually you will scale the actual
 

3083
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,829
Eventually you will scale the actual
image out to nothing and the noise will

3084
01:08:59,829 --> 01:08:59,839
image out to nothing and the noise will
 

3085
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:02,390
image out to nothing and the noise will
be all that remains. Okay. So this is

3086
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:02,400
be all that remains. Okay. So this is
 

3087
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,510
be all that remains. Okay. So this is
very practical, very important. Um,

3088
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:05,520
very practical, very important. Um,
 

3089
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,110
very practical, very important. Um,
however,

3090
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:07,120
however,
 

3091
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,269
however,
it turns out that it's easier to

3092
01:09:09,269 --> 01:09:09,279
it turns out that it's easier to
 

3093
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,470
it turns out that it's easier to
understand this if we say, let me

3094
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:12,480
understand this if we say, let me
 

3095
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,789
understand this if we say, let me
pretend I don't do the scaling for

3096
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:14,799
pretend I don't do the scaling for
 

3097
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,110
pretend I don't do the scaling for
conceptual purposes.

3098
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:17,120
conceptual purposes.
 

3099
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,390
conceptual purposes.
And that's the treatment we're going to

3100
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:18,400
And that's the treatment we're going to
 

3101
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,349
And that's the treatment we're going to
follow here. Although we will

3102
01:09:21,349 --> 01:09:21,359
follow here. Although we will
 

3103
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:22,709
follow here. Although we will
acknowledge the other treatment in the

3104
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:22,719
acknowledge the other treatment in the
 

3105
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:24,709
acknowledge the other treatment in the
homework um with a extra problem we're

3106
01:09:24,709 --> 01:09:24,719
homework um with a extra problem we're
 

3107
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:27,349
homework um with a extra problem we're
giving you and you'll see a variation of

3108
01:09:27,349 --> 01:09:27,359
giving you and you'll see a variation of
 

3109
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,990
giving you and you'll see a variation of
it in discrete space for in tomorrow's

3110
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,000
it in discrete space for in tomorrow's
 

3111
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,950
it in discrete space for in tomorrow's
uh discussion. So I want to point out

3112
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:32,960
uh discussion. So I want to point out
 

3113
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,229
uh discussion. So I want to point out
this paper that came out uh June of last

3114
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:36,239
this paper that came out uh June of last
 

3115
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:39,349
this paper that came out uh June of last
year. Uh it's a tutorial paper um by

3116
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:39,359
year. Uh it's a tutorial paper um by
 

3117
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,590
year. Uh it's a tutorial paper um by
Pritham Nuran with co-authors who's now

3118
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:41,600
Pritham Nuran with co-authors who's now
 

3119
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,669
Pritham Nuran with co-authors who's now
at Apple again a former Berkeley

3120
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:43,679
at Apple again a former Berkeley
 

3121
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,430
at Apple again a former Berkeley
undergrad knew him then um called

3122
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:47,440
undergrad knew him then um called
 

3123
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,269
undergrad knew him then um called
stepby-step diffusion and elementary

3124
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:49,279
stepby-step diffusion and elementary
 

3125
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,590
stepby-step diffusion and elementary
tutorial. So I really recommend this.

3126
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:53,600
tutorial. So I really recommend this.
 

3127
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,430
tutorial. So I really recommend this.
We're going to follow that perspective.

3128
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440
We're going to follow that perspective.
 

3129
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,870
We're going to follow that perspective.
So let's go back here. Okay. So we want

3130
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
So let's go back here. Okay. So we want
 

3131
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,830
So let's go back here. Okay. So we want
to understand how to move from

3132
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:03,840

 

3133
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,070

some place you know here onto here onto

3134
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:08,080
some place you know here onto here onto
 

3135
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,630
some place you know here onto here onto
the image onto the manifold of natural

3136
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:10,640
the image onto the manifold of natural
 

3137
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,910
the image onto the manifold of natural
images somehow.

3138
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:13,920
images somehow.
 

3139
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,229
images somehow.
So

3140
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:16,239
So
 

3141
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,470
So
what we're going to do for simplicity in

3142
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:18,480
what we're going to do for simplicity in
 

3143
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,149
what we're going to do for simplicity in
this picture is we're not going to worry

3144
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:20,159
this picture is we're not going to worry
 

3145
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,669
this picture is we're not going to worry
about any of the scaling. We're

3146
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:21,679
about any of the scaling. We're
 

3147
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,510
about any of the scaling. We're
literally going to do the obvious thing.

3148
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:23,520
literally going to do the obvious thing.
 

3149
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,430
literally going to do the obvious thing.
We're going to take an image or whatever

3150
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:25,440
We're going to take an image or whatever
 

3151
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,510
We're going to take an image or whatever
vector we're abstract vector and we're

3152
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:27,520
vector we're abstract vector and we're
 

3153
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,310
vector we're abstract vector and we're
just going to add noise to it. Keep

3154
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:30,320
just going to add noise to it. Keep
 

3155
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,669
just going to add noise to it. Keep
adding noise to it.

3156
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:33,679
adding noise to it.
 

3157
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,750
adding noise to it.
So

3158
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:35,760
So
 

3159
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,950
So
idea is start here with something that's

3160
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:38,960
idea is start here with something that's
 

3161
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,189
idea is start here with something that's
actually on the unknown distribution

3162
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:41,199
actually on the unknown distribution
 

3163
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,110
actually on the unknown distribution
that we want to learn. Okay, we don't

3164
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:43,120
that we want to learn. Okay, we don't
 

3165
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,110
that we want to learn. Okay, we don't
know what this distribution is, but we

3166
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:45,120
know what this distribution is, but we
 

3167
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,830
know what this distribution is, but we
have samples of it. Add noise, add

3168
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:47,840
have samples of it. Add noise, add
 

3169
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,430
have samples of it. Add noise, add
noise, add noise, add noise, add noise,

3170
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,440
noise, add noise, add noise, add noise,
 

3171
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,510
noise, add noise, add noise, add noise,
add noise, add noise. And if you want to

3172
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:51,520
add noise, add noise. And if you want to
 

3173
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,189
add noise, add noise. And if you want to
think about it, think of it this way.

3174
01:10:53,189 --> 01:10:53,199
think about it, think of it this way.
 

3175
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,870
think about it, think of it this way.
Suppose this thing was something which

3176
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:54,880
Suppose this thing was something which
 

3177
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,030
Suppose this thing was something which
had pixel values between minus1 and one.

3178
01:10:59,030 --> 01:10:59,040
had pixel values between minus1 and one.
 

3179
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,149
had pixel values between minus1 and one.
Okay? And I keep adding noise. At some

3180
01:11:02,149 --> 01:11:02,159
Okay? And I keep adding noise. At some
 

3181
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:04,709
Okay? And I keep adding noise. At some
point, I keep adding Gaussian noise.

3182
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:04,719
point, I keep adding Gaussian noise.
 

3183
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:05,910
point, I keep adding Gaussian noise.
Gaussian noise. Keep adding Gaussian

3184
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:05,920
Gaussian noise. Keep adding Gaussian
 

3185
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,910
Gaussian noise. Keep adding Gaussian
noise.

3186
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:07,920
noise.
 

3187
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,630
noise.
At some point, I have something where

3188
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:10,640
At some point, I have something where
 

3189
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,709
At some point, I have something where
the Gaussian noise is standard deviation

3190
01:11:12,709 --> 01:11:12,719
the Gaussian noise is standard deviation
 

3191
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:15,430
the Gaussian noise is standard deviation
is 10,000 because I keep adding it.

3192
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:15,440
is 10,000 because I keep adding it.
 

3193
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,430
is 10,000 because I keep adding it.
10,000 steps of adding standard

3194
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:17,440
10,000 steps of adding standard
 

3195
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,310
10,000 steps of adding standard
deviation one. For example,

3196
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:20,320
deviation one. For example,
 

3197
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,229
deviation one. For example,
at this point, this is a Gaussian with

3198
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:22,239
at this point, this is a Gaussian with
 

3199
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,070
at this point, this is a Gaussian with
standard deviation 10,000 in every

3200
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:24,080
standard deviation 10,000 in every
 

3201
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,950
standard deviation 10,000 in every
vector. And sure, that original minus1

3202
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:26,960
vector. And sure, that original minus1
 

3203
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,030
vector. And sure, that original minus1
to one is in there somewhere, but it's

3204
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
to one is in there somewhere, but it's
 

3205
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,110
to one is in there somewhere, but it's
basically gone at this point. This is

3206
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:31,120
basically gone at this point. This is
 

3207
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,390
basically gone at this point. This is
you could basically just sample a

3208
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:32,400
you could basically just sample a
 

3209
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,189
you could basically just sample a
Gaussian and get the same thing.

3210
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:35,199
Gaussian and get the same thing.
 

3211
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:38,149
Gaussian and get the same thing.
Okay, so this is the the picture of the

3212
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:38,159
Okay, so this is the the picture of the
 

3213
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:42,550
Okay, so this is the the picture of the
forward um part of the diffusion. And

3214
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:42,560
forward um part of the diffusion. And
 

3215
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,270
forward um part of the diffusion. And
our perspective on this is to say, can

3216
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:45,280
our perspective on this is to say, can
 

3217
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:53,270
our perspective on this is to say, can
we think about this so that

3218
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:53,280

 

3219
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,910

having trained a network

3220
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:55,920
having trained a network
 

3221
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,990
having trained a network
on these kind of forward paths which we

3222
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:58,000
on these kind of forward paths which we
 

3223
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,750
on these kind of forward paths which we
can simulate, we can generate these

3224
01:11:59,750 --> 01:11:59,760
can simulate, we can generate these
 

3225
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,390
can simulate, we can generate these
easily, can we train a network that will

3226
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:02,400
easily, can we train a network that will
 

3227
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,510
easily, can we train a network that will
allow us to go backward?

3228
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:05,520
allow us to go backward?
 

3229
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,550
allow us to go backward?
Okay, this is a a version of the basic

3230
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:08,560
Okay, this is a a version of the basic
 

3231
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:14,950
Okay, this is a a version of the basic
picture of it's possible

3232
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:14,960

 

3233
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,630

uh

3234
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:18,640

 

3235
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,189

it's possible to go in this direction.

3236
01:12:21,189 --> 01:12:21,199
it's possible to go in this direction.
 

3237
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:24,870
it's possible to go in this direction.
Start there and move out. Can I go in

3238
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:24,880
Start there and move out. Can I go in
 

3239
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:30,790
Start there and move out. Can I go in
this direction?

3240
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:30,800

 

3241
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,470

This way.

3242
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:34,480

 

3243
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,669

So we're trying to network to predict

3244
01:12:35,669 --> 01:12:35,679
So we're trying to network to predict
 

3245
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,110
So we're trying to network to predict
backwards in time.

3246
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:39,120
backwards in time.
 

3247
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,270
backwards in time.
So to understand this

3248
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,280
So to understand this
 

3249
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,510
So to understand this
right

3250
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:45,520
right
 

3251
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,350
right
there's many many steps conceptually

3252
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
there's many many steps conceptually
 

3253
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,430
there's many many steps conceptually
that we have to get get uh understand

3254
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:49,440
that we have to get get uh understand
 

3255
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,910
that we have to get get uh understand
how to do somehow you train a network

3256
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:51,920
how to do somehow you train a network
 

3257
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,270
how to do somehow you train a network
and then you have to somehow use this

3258
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:53,280
and then you have to somehow use this
 

3259
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,709
and then you have to somehow use this
network to move backwards.

3260
01:12:56,709 --> 01:12:56,719
network to move backwards.
 

3261
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,390
network to move backwards.
Okay.

3262
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:58,400
Okay.
 

3263
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,229
Okay.
So

3264
01:13:00,229 --> 01:13:00,239
So
 

3265
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:02,149
So
there's an interesting design question

3266
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:02,159
there's an interesting design question
 

3267
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:04,630
there's an interesting design question
which we have to ask and that actually

3268
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:04,640
which we have to ask and that actually
 

3269
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,149
which we have to ask and that actually
divides the approaches into two

3270
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:06,159
divides the approaches into two
 

3271
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,790
divides the approaches into two
different approaches and the key design

3272
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:08,800
different approaches and the key design
 

3273
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,910
different approaches and the key design
question is do I need to have randomness

3274
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:11,920
question is do I need to have randomness
 

3275
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,910
question is do I need to have randomness
on the backward path. So I drew this

3276
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:13,920
on the backward path. So I drew this
 

3277
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,630
on the backward path. So I drew this
path as shaking is it are paths like

3278
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:16,640
path as shaking is it are paths like
 

3279
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:26,070
path as shaking is it are paths like
that or are paths like this?

3280
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,080

 

3281
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,390

Okay.

3282
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:28,400
Okay.
 

3283
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,070
Okay.
So remember in auto reggressive

3284
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:30,080
So remember in auto reggressive
 

3285
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,750
So remember in auto reggressive
generation when you do auto reggressive

3286
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:31,760
generation when you do auto reggressive
 

3287
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,990
generation when you do auto reggressive
gener you do use randomness as you move

3288
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:34,000
gener you do use randomness as you move
 

3289
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,229
gener you do use randomness as you move
you keep doing this random sampling as

3290
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:36,239
you keep doing this random sampling as
 

3291
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:37,590
you keep doing this random sampling as
you're doing the generation token by

3292
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:37,600
you're doing the generation token by
 

3293
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,709
you're doing the generation token by
token.

3294
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:40,719

 

3295
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,590

Okay. So we're going to start with the

3296
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:43,600
Okay. So we're going to start with the
 

3297
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,669
Okay. So we're going to start with the
randomness is totally natural

3298
01:13:45,669 --> 01:13:45,679
randomness is totally natural
 

3299
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:48,149
randomness is totally natural
perspective and later not this lecture

3300
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:48,159
perspective and later not this lecture
 

3301
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:50,310
perspective and later not this lecture
but the next lecture I will show how we

3302
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:50,320
but the next lecture I will show how we
 

3303
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:54,070
but the next lecture I will show how we
can eliminate this randomness um in the

3304
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:54,080
can eliminate this randomness um in the
 

3305
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,350
can eliminate this randomness um in the
in the backward path.

3306
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:57,360
in the backward path.
 

3307
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,669
in the backward path.
So

3308
01:13:59,669 --> 01:13:59,679
So
 

3309
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:01,750
So
these approaches are divided into two

3310
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:01,760
these approaches are divided into two
 

3311
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,910
these approaches are divided into two
different categories. When you do

3312
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:03,920
different categories. When you do
 

3313
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,590
different categories. When you do
randomness

3314
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:05,600
randomness
 

3315
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,149
randomness
in the way that you go backward, that's

3316
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:08,159
in the way that you go backward, that's
 

3317
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:11,590
in the way that you go backward, that's
called stochcastic sampling.

3318
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:11,600
called stochcastic sampling.
 

3319
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,189
called stochcastic sampling.
And when you don't have randomness, it's

3320
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:13,199
And when you don't have randomness, it's
 

3321
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,830
And when you don't have randomness, it's
called deterministic sampling.

3322
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:15,840
called deterministic sampling.
 

3323
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,310
called deterministic sampling.
And kind of paradmatic approaches are

3324
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:18,320
And kind of paradmatic approaches are
 

3325
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,350
And kind of paradmatic approaches are
what are called DDPM and DDIM

3326
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:21,360
what are called DDPM and DDIM
 

3327
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,910
what are called DDPM and DDIM
for this. And we're going to talk about

3328
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:23,920
for this. And we're going to talk about
 

3329
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,950
for this. And we're going to talk about
the original solixine at all paper was a

3330
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:26,960
the original solixine at all paper was a
 

3331
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,390
the original solixine at all paper was a
DDPM and we're going to start with that

3332
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:28,400
DDPM and we're going to start with that
 

3333
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,990
DDPM and we're going to start with that
one. And then there's approaches that do

3334
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,000
one. And then there's approaches that do
 

3335
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,070
one. And then there's approaches that do
this.

3336
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:34,080
this.
 

3337
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,310
this.
We'll do that next time.

3338
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:36,320
We'll do that next time.
 

3339
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,709
We'll do that next time.
Okay. So first

3340
01:14:38,709 --> 01:14:38,719
Okay. So first
 

3341
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,430
Okay. So first
let's uh

3342
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:41,440
let's uh
 

3343
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,510
let's uh
let's explain this. Maybe it's good for

3344
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:43,520
let's explain this. Maybe it's good for
 

3345
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,950
let's explain this. Maybe it's good for
a moment to explain why is this thought

3346
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:44,960
a moment to explain why is this thought
 

3347
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,229
a moment to explain why is this thought
of as um

3348
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:48,239
of as um
 

3349
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:51,110
of as um
why is this called diffusion? Okay. Why

3350
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:51,120
why is this called diffusion? Okay. Why
 

3351
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:57,910
why is this called diffusion? Okay. Why
is it called diffusion at all?

3352
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:57,920

 

3353
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,910

So, here's a picture of why it's called

3354
01:14:59,910 --> 01:14:59,920
So, here's a picture of why it's called
 

3355
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,910
So, here's a picture of why it's called
diffusion. Okay. Think of a glass of

3356
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:01,920
diffusion. Okay. Think of a glass of
 

3357
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,990
diffusion. Okay. Think of a glass of
water.

3358
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:06,000

 

3359
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,590

Okay.

3360
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:07,600
Okay.
 

3361
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,070
Okay.
Water.

3362
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:10,080
Water.
 

3363
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:13,510
Water.
Okay. Now, we're going to do make

3364
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:13,520
Okay. Now, we're going to do make
 

3365
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,350
Okay. Now, we're going to do make
believe is we're going to have a very

3366
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:15,360
believe is we're going to have a very
 

3367
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,229
believe is we're going to have a very
very slow motion camera. Okay. or if you

3368
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:18,239
very slow motion camera. Okay. or if you
 

3369
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:19,750
very slow motion camera. Okay. or if you
want to not think of as water, think of

3370
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:19,760
want to not think of as water, think of
 

3371
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:24,229
want to not think of as water, think of
it as a more viscous uh liquid. Okay,

3372
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:24,239
it as a more viscous uh liquid. Okay,
 

3373
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:33,189
it as a more viscous uh liquid. Okay,
we're going to take a pipet,

3374
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:33,199

 

3375
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,510

dip it in the water, and I'm going to

3376
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
dip it in the water, and I'm going to
 

3377
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:40,310
dip it in the water, and I'm going to
inject a little bit of

3378
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:40,320
inject a little bit of
 

3379
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,630
inject a little bit of
red dye

3380
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:44,640

 

3381
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,830

in a little curve here. Okay, so a

3382
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:47,840
in a little curve here. Okay, so a
 

3383
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,630
in a little curve here. Okay, so a
little bit of red dye is going to be put

3384
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:50,640
little bit of red dye is going to be put
 

3385
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,390
little bit of red dye is going to be put
into this water.

3386
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:54,400

 

3387
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,390

Everyone understand the picture? What

3388
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,400
Everyone understand the picture? What
 

3389
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,870
Everyone understand the picture? What
happens next?

3390
01:15:58,870 --> 01:15:58,880
happens next?
 

3391
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,390
happens next?
Okay, what happens next is that red dye

3392
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:02,400
Okay, what happens next is that red dye
 

3393
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,990
Okay, what happens next is that red dye
is going to by the random motion,

3394
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,000
is going to by the random motion,
 

3395
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,630
is going to by the random motion,
thermal motion of these water molecules

3396
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:08,640
thermal motion of these water molecules
 

3397
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,630
thermal motion of these water molecules
is going to be pulled out and diffuse

3398
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:12,640
is going to be pulled out and diffuse
 

3399
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,390
is going to be pulled out and diffuse
until eventually it fills the entire

3400
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400
until eventually it fills the entire
 

3401
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,390
until eventually it fills the entire
glass of water.

3402
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:16,400
glass of water.
 

3403
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,830
glass of water.
Everyone see that? Now when that red dye

3404
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:19,840
Everyone see that? Now when that red dye
 

3405
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,149
Everyone see that? Now when that red dye
has diffused out and has filled the

3406
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:22,159
has diffused out and has filled the
 

3407
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,390
has diffused out and has filled the
entire glass of water, this thing is in

3408
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:24,400
entire glass of water, this thing is in
 

3409
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,229
entire glass of water, this thing is in
equilibrium.

3410
01:16:26,229 --> 01:16:26,239
equilibrium.
 

3411
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,910
equilibrium.
It doesn't mean that every individual

3412
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:27,920
It doesn't mean that every individual
 

3413
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,310
It doesn't mean that every individual
red dye molecule is no longer moving

3414
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:30,320
red dye molecule is no longer moving
 

3415
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:34,149
red dye molecule is no longer moving
around randomly. In fact, it is. But at

3416
01:16:34,149 --> 01:16:34,159
around randomly. In fact, it is. But at
 

3417
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,149
around randomly. In fact, it is. But at
the macro scale, there's red dye

3418
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:36,159
the macro scale, there's red dye
 

3419
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,310
the macro scale, there's red dye
everywhere.

3420
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:38,320
everywhere.
 

3421
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,430
everywhere.
Okay. So this process is called

3422
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,440
Okay. So this process is called
 

3423
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,110
Okay. So this process is called
diffusion.

3424
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:43,120
diffusion.
 

3425
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,590
diffusion.
We want to do the same thing for images.

3426
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:45,600
We want to do the same thing for images.
 

3427
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,830
We want to do the same thing for images.
So imagine a movie of this red dye

3428
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:47,840
So imagine a movie of this red dye
 

3429
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,790
So imagine a movie of this red dye
diffusing out.

3430
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:50,800
diffusing out.
 

3431
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,510
diffusing out.
We want to run that movie in reverse.

3432
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:55,520
We want to run that movie in reverse.
 

3433
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,390
We want to run that movie in reverse.
Okay? And we want to have something move

3434
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:58,400
Okay? And we want to have something move
 

3435
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,910
Okay? And we want to have something move
from equilibrium out into

3436
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:01,920
from equilibrium out into
 

3437
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,110
from equilibrium out into
non-equilibrium state.

3438
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:05,120
non-equilibrium state.
 

3439
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,070
non-equilibrium state.
Okay? Now equilibrium you should think

3440
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:08,080
Okay? Now equilibrium you should think
 

3441
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,910
Okay? Now equilibrium you should think
about in your probability language is

3442
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:09,920
about in your probability language is
 

3443
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,229
about in your probability language is
like stationary distributions.

3444
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
like stationary distributions.
 

3445
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:13,590
like stationary distributions.
So you want to move from a stationary

3446
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:13,600
So you want to move from a stationary
 

3447
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,110
So you want to move from a stationary
distribution to a non-stationary

3448
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:15,120
distribution to a non-stationary
 

3449
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,790
distribution to a non-stationary
distribution. Everyone with me in terms

3450
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:16,800
distribution. Everyone with me in terms
 

3451
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,790
distribution. Everyone with me in terms
of the analogies. This is why it's

3452
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:18,800
of the analogies. This is why it's
 

3453
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:25,110
of the analogies. This is why it's
called diffusion. So now for intuition

3454
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:25,120
called diffusion. So now for intuition
 

3455
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,110
called diffusion. So now for intuition
we want to simulate the stoastic case is

3456
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,120
we want to simulate the stoastic case is
 

3457
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,390
we want to simulate the stoastic case is
we literally want to simulate the

3458
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:28,400
we literally want to simulate the
 

3459
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,229
we literally want to simulate the
reverse process. We have a process that

3460
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:30,239
reverse process. We have a process that
 

3461
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,070
reverse process. We have a process that
was well defined.

3462
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:32,080
was well defined.
 

3463
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,550
was well defined.
Take something add noise. You want to

3464
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:34,560
Take something add noise. You want to
 

3465
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,790
Take something add noise. You want to
simulate the reverse process. If you

3466
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:36,800
simulate the reverse process. If you
 

3467
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,550
simulate the reverse process. If you
want to think about stocastic processes,

3468
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,560
want to think about stocastic processes,
 

3469
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,790
want to think about stocastic processes,
your go-to intuitive model is markoff

3470
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:40,800
your go-to intuitive model is markoff
 

3471
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,709
your go-to intuitive model is markoff
chains because you've all seen them. So

3472
01:17:44,709 --> 01:17:44,719
chains because you've all seen them. So
 

3473
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:47,270
chains because you've all seen them. So
consider the simple three-state markoff

3474
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:47,280
consider the simple three-state markoff
 

3475
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,830
consider the simple three-state markoff
chain for illustrative purposes. I have

3476
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:49,840
chain for illustrative purposes. I have
 

3477
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,590
chain for illustrative purposes. I have
states A, B, and C. I have 90%

3478
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:53,600
states A, B, and C. I have 90%
 

3479
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,830
states A, B, and C. I have 90%
probability of staying in state and I

3480
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:55,840
probability of staying in state and I
 

3481
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,310
probability of staying in state and I
have a 5% probability of going to one of

3482
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:58,320
have a 5% probability of going to one of
 

3483
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,390
have a 5% probability of going to one of
the other states.

3484
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:00,400
the other states.
 

3485
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,470
the other states.
Everyone understand this markup chain?

3486
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:02,480
Everyone understand this markup chain?
 

3487
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:07,510
Everyone understand this markup chain?
What's a stationary distribution? 1/3

3488
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:07,520

 

3489
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,430

Okay.

3490
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:09,440
Okay.
 

3491
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,830
Okay.
Now to understand the counterpart of

3492
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:11,840
Now to understand the counterpart of
 

3493
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:16,070
Now to understand the counterpart of
diffusion models, think of it this way.

3494
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:16,080
diffusion models, think of it this way.
 

3495
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,430
diffusion models, think of it this way.
Suppose my desired distribution was not

3496
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:19,440
Suppose my desired distribution was not
 

3497
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,310
Suppose my desired distribution was not
the equilibrium distribution. My desired

3498
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:22,320
the equilibrium distribution. My desired
 

3499
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:28,870
the equilibrium distribution. My desired
distribution was 1/2 in A and 1/2 in C.

3500
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:28,880

 

3501
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,149

Okay. So suppose I started with examples

3502
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:32,159
Okay. So suppose I started with examples
 

3503
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,750
Okay. So suppose I started with examples
that were half the time in A and half

3504
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:33,760
that were half the time in A and half
 

3505
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:37,910
that were half the time in A and half
the time in C and never in B.

3506
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:37,920
the time in C and never in B.
 

3507
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,669
the time in C and never in B.
Okay. So the picture I want to think

3508
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:39,679
Okay. So the picture I want to think
 

3509
01:18:39,679 --> 01:19:02,070
Okay. So the picture I want to think
about is

3510
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:02,080

 

3511
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,149

I start in this and I take a bunch of

3512
01:19:04,149 --> 01:19:04,159
I start in this and I take a bunch of
 

3513
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:06,070
I start in this and I take a bunch of
steps. So now the diffusion process is

3514
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:06,080
steps. So now the diffusion process is
 

3515
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,790
steps. So now the diffusion process is
operation of the markup chain. Okay,

3516
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:08,800
operation of the markup chain. Okay,
 

3517
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,790
operation of the markup chain. Okay,
take many many many many steps and

3518
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:10,800
take many many many many steps and
 

3519
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,590
take many many many many steps and
eventually I'll end up in

3520
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:13,600
eventually I'll end up in
 

3521
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:22,470
eventually I'll end up in
1/3.

3522
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:22,480

 

3523
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,189

Now suppose I was watching this movie

3524
01:19:25,189 --> 01:19:25,199
Now suppose I was watching this movie
 

3525
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:27,750
Now suppose I was watching this movie
run in reverse.

3526
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:27,760
run in reverse.
 

3527
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,830
run in reverse.
Okay. So what does the movie look like

3528
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:29,840
Okay. So what does the movie look like
 

3529
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,189
Okay. So what does the movie look like
going forward? It looks like hang out

3530
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:33,199
going forward? It looks like hang out
 

3531
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:37,430
going forward? It looks like hang out
here, go here, go here, go here, go

3532
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:37,440
here, go here, go here, go here, go
 

3533
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,590
here, go here, go here, go here, go
here, go here. Kind of bounce around,

3534
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:39,600
here, go here. Kind of bounce around,
 

3535
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,870
here, go here. Kind of bounce around,
right? Do this kind of thing. That's the

3536
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:40,880
right? Do this kind of thing. That's the
 

3537
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:44,790
right? Do this kind of thing. That's the
movie. So this movie after it's moved

3538
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:44,800
movie. So this movie after it's moved
 

3539
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,350
movie. So this movie after it's moved
around for a long time,

3540
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:47,360
around for a long time,
 

3541
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,110
around for a long time,
you can't tell going forward and going

3542
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:49,120
you can't tell going forward and going
 

3543
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,110
you can't tell going forward and going
backward anymore.

3544
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
backward anymore.
 

3545
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,630
backward anymore.
looks the same going forward, going

3546
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:52,640
looks the same going forward, going
 

3547
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,390
looks the same going forward, going
backward.

3548
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:54,400
backward.
 

3549
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,669
backward.
Everyone see that stationary

3550
01:19:55,669 --> 01:19:55,679
Everyone see that stationary
 

3551
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,590
Everyone see that stationary
distribution kind of point of view for

3552
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:57,600
distribution kind of point of view for
 

3553
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,110
distribution kind of point of view for
this markup chain happens to be

3554
01:19:59,110 --> 01:19:59,120
this markup chain happens to be
 

3555
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,669
this markup chain happens to be
reversible.

3556
01:20:01,669 --> 01:20:01,679
reversible.
 

3557
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:05,189
reversible.
But when you run it backwards,

3558
01:20:05,189 --> 01:20:05,199
But when you run it backwards,
 

3559
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:08,470
But when you run it backwards,
something different happens.

3560
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:08,480
something different happens.
 

3561
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,630
something different happens.
When you run it backwards,

3562
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:10,640
When you run it backwards,
 

3563
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:14,709
When you run it backwards,
what'll happen is it'll slowly move mass

3564
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:14,719
what'll happen is it'll slowly move mass
 

3565
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,630
what'll happen is it'll slowly move mass
into A and C.

3566
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:18,640

 

3567
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,510

Do you see that?

3568
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,520
Do you see that?
 

3569
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,709
Do you see that?
So when I run the diffusion markup chain

3570
01:20:24,709 --> 01:20:24,719
So when I run the diffusion markup chain
 

3571
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,030
So when I run the diffusion markup chain
backwards, what'll happen is at over

3572
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:27,040
backwards, what'll happen is at over
 

3573
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,830
backwards, what'll happen is at over
here

3574
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:29,840
here
 

3575
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,430
here
it'll be randomly bouncing around

3576
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
it'll be randomly bouncing around
 

3577
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:37,990
it'll be randomly bouncing around
but sometime it'll start having a pull

3578
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:38,000
but sometime it'll start having a pull
 

3579
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,750
but sometime it'll start having a pull
towards A and C. So in particular if the

3580
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:41,760
towards A and C. So in particular if the
 

3581
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,070
towards A and C. So in particular if the
very next step

3582
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,080
very next step
 

3583
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,470
very next step
after the first step suppose after the

3584
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:46,480
after the first step suppose after the
 

3585
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,510
after the first step suppose after the
very next step you happen to be in B

3586
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:49,520
very next step you happen to be in B
 

3587
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,189
very next step you happen to be in B
what does the markoff chain look like

3588
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:51,199
what does the markoff chain look like
 

3589
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:53,990
what does the markoff chain look like
backwards from that last step that very

3590
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:54,000
backwards from that last step that very
 

3591
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,990
backwards from that last step that very
first step

3592
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:56,000
first step
 

3593
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,070
first step
well there's a half probability that you

3594
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
well there's a half probability that you
 

3595
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,390
well there's a half probability that you
came from A and a half probability you

3596
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:00,400
came from A and a half probability you
 

3597
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,590
came from A and a half probability you
came from C. There is no probability you

3598
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:03,600
came from C. There is no probability you
 

3599
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,390
came from C. There is no probability you
came from B. you're definitely moving

3600
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:06,400
came from B. you're definitely moving
 

3601
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,910
came from B. you're definitely moving
and you're moving here or here.

3602
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:09,920
and you're moving here or here.
 

3603
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,630
and you're moving here or here.
Do you see that? Whereas if you're in A,

3604
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:12,640
Do you see that? Whereas if you're in A,
 

3605
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,070
Do you see that? Whereas if you're in A,
you know, you're mostly in A. There's a

3606
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,080
you know, you're mostly in A. There's a
 

3607
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,030
you know, you're mostly in A. There's a
small probability you came from C. You

3608
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,040
small probability you came from C. You
 

3609
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,310
small probability you came from C. You
start say C, there's some probability

3610
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:18,320
start say C, there's some probability
 

3611
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,990
start say C, there's some probability
you came from A, but mostly in C. You're

3612
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:20,000
you came from A, but mostly in C. You're
 

3613
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,950
you came from A, but mostly in C. You're
never moving to B.

3614
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:22,960
never moving to B.
 

3615
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,189
never moving to B.
So the markup chain looks different in

3616
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:25,199
So the markup chain looks different in
 

3617
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:27,110
So the markup chain looks different in
the forward and reverse direction

3618
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:27,120
the forward and reverse direction
 

3619
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,189
the forward and reverse direction
because it started out of a stationary

3620
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
because it started out of a stationary
 

3621
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,030
because it started out of a stationary
distribution.

3622
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:31,040
distribution.
 

3623
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:34,790
distribution.
So the markoff chain is time invariant

3624
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:34,800
So the markoff chain is time invariant
 

3625
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,270
So the markoff chain is time invariant
going forward

3626
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:37,280
going forward
 

3627
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,189
going forward
but going backwards it's time varying.

3628
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:41,199
but going backwards it's time varying.
 

3629
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,430
but going backwards it's time varying.
It's still markoff but it's time varying

3630
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:43,440
It's still markoff but it's time varying
 

3631
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,910
It's still markoff but it's time varying
going backwards.

3632
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:45,920
going backwards.
 

3633
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,750
going backwards.
Okay. So with that intuition you can see

3634
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:49,760
Okay. So with that intuition you can see
 

3635
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,830
Okay. So with that intuition you can see
that if you want to run this process

3636
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:51,840
that if you want to run this process
 

3637
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,070
that if you want to run this process
backward you're going to be adding it's

3638
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:54,080
backward you're going to be adding it's
 

3639
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,510
backward you're going to be adding it's
going to be moving around. You're going

3640
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:55,520
going to be moving around. You're going
 

3641
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,990
going to be moving around. You're going
to be adding noise as you go as you move

3642
01:21:57,990 --> 01:21:58,000
to be adding noise as you go as you move
 

3643
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,669
to be adding noise as you go as you move
backwards.

3644
01:21:59,669 --> 01:21:59,679
backwards.
 

3645
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,790
backwards.
So

3646
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:02,800

 

3647
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,390

the key thing to think about is we're

3648
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:06,400
the key thing to think about is we're
 

3649
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,310
the key thing to think about is we're
interested in

3650
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:08,320
interested in
 

3651
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:11,430
interested in
what does one step of moving backward in

3652
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:11,440
what does one step of moving backward in
 

3653
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:15,030
what does one step of moving backward in
the markup chain look like.

3654
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,040
the markup chain look like.
 

3655
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,350
the markup chain look like.
So it's time varying for sure. Everyone

3656
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:17,360
So it's time varying for sure. Everyone
 

3657
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,270
So it's time varying for sure. Everyone
there you got that from this intuition.

3658
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:19,280
there you got that from this intuition.
 

3659
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,950
there you got that from this intuition.
Same thing's going to be here true here.

3660
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:20,960
Same thing's going to be here true here.
 

3661
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,310
Same thing's going to be here true here.
So what is the backward path look like?

3662
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:24,320
So what is the backward path look like?
 

3663
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,950
So what is the backward path look like?
Is it like a Gaussian?

3664
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:26,960
Is it like a Gaussian?
 

3665
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,310
Is it like a Gaussian?
If it was like a Gaussian, we can think

3666
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:28,320
If it was like a Gaussian, we can think
 

3667
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,910
If it was like a Gaussian, we can think
about it more easily. If it's not like a

3668
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:29,920
about it more easily. If it's not like a
 

3669
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,870
about it more easily. If it's not like a
Gaussian, it's harder to think about.

3670
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:32,880
Gaussian, it's harder to think about.
 

3671
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,229
Gaussian, it's harder to think about.
At some point, it's definitely not

3672
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:34,239
At some point, it's definitely not
 

3673
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:35,669
At some point, it's definitely not
Gaussian because you started with

3674
01:22:35,669 --> 01:22:35,679
Gaussian because you started with
 

3675
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:37,030
Gaussian because you started with
something that was definitely not

3676
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:37,040
something that was definitely not
 

3677
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,870
something that was definitely not
Gaussian.

3678
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:38,880
Gaussian.
 

3679
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,629
Gaussian.
But

3680
01:22:40,629 --> 01:22:40,639
But
 

3681
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:42,390
But
if we assume the forward path is

3682
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:42,400
if we assume the forward path is
 

3683
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,830
if we assume the forward path is
conditionally Gaussian like we're doing,

3684
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:43,840
conditionally Gaussian like we're doing,
 

3685
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,830
conditionally Gaussian like we're doing,
we're adding a little bit of noise.

3686
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:47,840

 

3687
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,149

It turns out, and we'll talk about why

3688
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:50,159
It turns out, and we'll talk about why
 

3689
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:54,070
It turns out, and we'll talk about why
next time, that as long as the density

3690
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:54,080
next time, that as long as the density
 

3691
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,110
next time, that as long as the density
for X0 is sufficiently smooth,

3692
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:57,120
for X0 is sufficiently smooth,
 

3693
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,709
for X0 is sufficiently smooth,
if this additive noise is small enough

3694
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:00,719
if this additive noise is small enough
 

3695
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:02,550
if this additive noise is small enough
that

3696
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:02,560
that
 

3697
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,270
that
the backward path also looks

3698
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,280
the backward path also looks
 

3699
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:09,350
the backward path also looks
conditionally Gaussian approximately.

3700
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:09,360
conditionally Gaussian approximately.
 

3701
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,189
conditionally Gaussian approximately.
So when you look at the probability

3702
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:11,199
So when you look at the probability
 

3703
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,350
So when you look at the probability
distribution for XT minus one condition

3704
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:13,360
distribution for XT minus one condition
 

3705
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,149
distribution for XT minus one condition
on XT, what you get is something that

3706
01:23:16,149 --> 01:23:16,159
on XT, what you get is something that
 

3707
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:18,390
on XT, what you get is something that
has a mean that depends on where you

3708
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:18,400
has a mean that depends on where you
 

3709
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,990
has a mean that depends on where you
were

3710
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:20,000
were
 

3711
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,030
were
and a noise that's Gaussian. So that

3712
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:23,040
and a noise that's Gaussian. So that
 

3713
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,990
and a noise that's Gaussian. So that
mean depending on where you were is the

3714
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:26,000
mean depending on where you were is the
 

3715
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,990
mean depending on where you were is the
difference between A and C. A and C in

3716
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:28,000
difference between A and C. A and C in
 

3717
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,430
difference between A and C. A and C in
that example and B. B will tend to flow

3718
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:31,440
that example and B. B will tend to flow
 

3719
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,709
that example and B. B will tend to flow
towards A and B. A and C will have a

3720
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:34,719
towards A and B. A and C will have a
 

3721
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,870
towards A and B. A and C will have a
different flow. That's what this is

3722
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:36,880
different flow. That's what this is
 

3723
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,790
different flow. That's what this is
capturing in the Gaussian setting.

3724
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:40,800

 

3725
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,310

And

3726
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:44,320

 

3727
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,990

this is the thing we need to learn from

3728
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:46,000
this is the thing we need to learn from
 

3729
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,629
this is the thing we need to learn from
data.

3730
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:48,639
data.
 

3731
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:51,750
data.
Okay.

3732
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:51,760

 

3733
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,790

So

3734
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:54,800

 

3735
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,270

um I'll pause here and just comment on

3736
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:57,280
um I'll pause here and just comment on
 

3737
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,709
um I'll pause here and just comment on
this. So what we're going what you'll do

3738
01:23:58,709 --> 01:23:58,719
this. So what we're going what you'll do
 

3739
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:01,910
this. So what we're going what you'll do
in discussion is you will see let me

3740
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:01,920
in discussion is you will see let me
 

3741
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,470
in discussion is you will see let me
just go zip a little bit ahead is you'll

3742
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:04,480
just go zip a little bit ahead is you'll
 

3743
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,830
just go zip a little bit ahead is you'll
see how this kind of process works for a

3744
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:07,840
see how this kind of process works for a
 

3745
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,669
see how this kind of process works for a
very discrete setting where everything

3746
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:09,679
very discrete setting where everything
 

3747
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:14,629
very discrete setting where everything
is just zeros and ones. Okay. And what

3748
01:24:14,629 --> 01:24:14,639
is just zeros and ones. Okay. And what
 

3749
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,990
is just zeros and ones. Okay. And what
you're doing is you're sampling paths

3750
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:18,000
you're doing is you're sampling paths
 

3751
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,669
you're doing is you're sampling paths
going forward by picking a random place

3752
01:24:21,669 --> 01:24:21,679
going forward by picking a random place
 

3753
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,030
going forward by picking a random place
going forward adding noise and seeing

3754
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
going forward adding noise and seeing
 

3755
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,790
going forward adding noise and seeing
what one step looks like. And you're

3756
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
what one step looks like. And you're
 

3757
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,990
what one step looks like. And you're
trying to learn what's the probability

3758
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,000
trying to learn what's the probability
 

3759
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,270
trying to learn what's the probability
distribution going in the reverse

3760
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:27,280
distribution going in the reverse
 

3761
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,110
distribution going in the reverse
direction

3762
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:29,120
direction
 

3763
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,709
direction
from data. And once you have that, you

3764
01:24:32,709 --> 01:24:32,719
from data. And once you have that, you
 

3765
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,149
from data. And once you have that, you
will just run this process

3766
01:24:36,149 --> 01:24:36,159
will just run this process
 

3767
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:38,070
will just run this process
backwards because you know it's mean,

3768
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:38,080
backwards because you know it's mean,
 

3769
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,350
backwards because you know it's mean,
you know it's variance. You just run

3770
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:41,360
you know it's variance. You just run
 

3771
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,430
you know it's variance. You just run
and see where you end up. Okay. So next

3772
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:43,440
and see where you end up. Okay. So next
 

3773
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,709
and see where you end up. Okay. So next
time we'll continue. You'll see in

3774
01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:44,719
time we'll continue. You'll see in
 

3775
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:45,990
time we'll continue. You'll see in
discussion which will help you in a

3776
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:46,000
discussion which will help you in a
 

3777
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,709
discussion which will help you in a
discrete setting to uh see it slightly

3778
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:48,719
discrete setting to uh see it slightly
 

3779
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,229
discrete setting to uh see it slightly
differently and then we'll like put

3780
01:24:50,229 --> 01:24:50,239
differently and then we'll like put
 

3781
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:52,310
differently and then we'll like put
everything together.

3782
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:52,320
everything together.
 

3783
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,390
everything together.
Okay. See you guys on Thursday. I have

3784
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:54,400
Okay. See you guys on Thursday. I have
 

3785
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:07,110
Okay. See you guys on Thursday. I have
office hours now.

3786
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:07,120

 

3787
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,120

>> Yeah.
