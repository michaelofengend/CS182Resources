00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,470

Okay, we're at Berkeley. time. So, let's

2
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
Okay, we're at Berkeley. time. So, let's
 

3
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,789
Okay, we're at Berkeley. time. So, let's
get started.

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,390
get started.
Quick announcement before we start

6
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
Quick announcement before we start
 

7
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,910
Quick announcement before we start
class. Um, the weight list should have

8
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
class. Um, the weight list should have
 

9
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,550
class. Um, the weight list should have
processed and everyone should be

10
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
processed and everyone should be
 

11
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,750
processed and everyone should be
enrolled. So, if you expect to be

12
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
enrolled. So, if you expect to be
 

13
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,550
enrolled. So, if you expect to be
enrolled in this class, please go and

14
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
enrolled in this class, please go and
 

15
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,390
enrolled in this class, please go and
check your enrollment to see that you

16
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
check your enrollment to see that you
 

17
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,110
check your enrollment to see that you
actually are enrolled. If there is a

18
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
actually are enrolled. If there is a
 

19
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,110
actually are enrolled. If there is a
bug, some if something went wrong, you

20
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
bug, some if something went wrong, you
 

21
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,470
bug, some if something went wrong, you
know, stuff happens because there's

22
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
know, stuff happens because there's
 

23
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,789
know, stuff happens because there's
manual processing that happens to get

24
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
manual processing that happens to get
 

25
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,470
manual processing that happens to get
people in. So let us know now because

26
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
people in. So let us know now because
 

27
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,470
people in. So let us know now because
once the ad drop deadline is done this

28
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:02,480
once the ad drop deadline is done this
 

29
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,149
once the ad drop deadline is done this
will be much much much harder to fix. In

30
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
will be much much much harder to fix. In
 

31
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,990
will be much much much harder to fix. In
fact it might be impossible to fix.

32
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
fact it might be impossible to fix.
 

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,309
fact it might be impossible to fix.
Okay. So if you expect to be enrolled if

34
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
Okay. So if you expect to be enrolled if
 

35
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,630
Okay. So if you expect to be enrolled if
you have done homework zero if you've

36
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
you have done homework zero if you've
 

37
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,110
you have done homework zero if you've
you know make sure go and actually check

38
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
you know make sure go and actually check
 

39
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,550
you know make sure go and actually check
that you are actually enrolled. Don't

40
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
that you are actually enrolled. Don't
 

41
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,550
that you are actually enrolled. Don't
trust that you know because we said the

42
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
trust that you know because we said the
 

43
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,110
trust that you know because we said the
weight list cleared and because but if

44
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
weight list cleared and because but if
 

45
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,629
weight list cleared and because but if
you were on the weight list and you did

46
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
you were on the weight list and you did
 

47
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,310
you were on the weight list and you did
homework zero whether you were concurren

48
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
homework zero whether you were concurren
 

49
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,590
homework zero whether you were concurren
concurrent enrollment or not you should

50
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
concurrent enrollment or not you should
 

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,550
concurrent enrollment or not you should
be in the class. Okay, everyone good?

52
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
be in the class. Okay, everyone good?
 

53
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,430
be in the class. Okay, everyone good?
Um, just yeah, make sure please please

54
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
Um, just yeah, make sure please please
 

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,469
Um, just yeah, make sure please please
actually check this.

56
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
actually check this.
 

57
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,310
actually check this.
Um, in other word uh other news,

58
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
Um, in other word uh other news,
 

59
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,590
Um, in other word uh other news,
homework one will be due tomorrow. So,

60
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
homework one will be due tomorrow. So,
 

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,070
homework one will be due tomorrow. So,
make sure you're looking at that and are

62
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
make sure you're looking at that and are
 

63
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,070
make sure you're looking at that and are
on top of that

64
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
on top of that
 

65
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,189
on top of that
and um keep that in mind. Okay, any

66
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
and um keep that in mind. Okay, any
 

67
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,469
and um keep that in mind. Okay, any
questions before we start.

68
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
questions before we start.
 

69
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,350
questions before we start.
Okay, good. So today we're going to

70
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
Okay, good. So today we're going to
 

71
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,350
Okay, good. So today we're going to
basically continue with where we left

72
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
basically continue with where we left
 

73
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,990
basically continue with where we left
off in the last lecture and we're going

74
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
off in the last lecture and we're going
 

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,790
off in the last lecture and we're going
to talk about this perspective of trying

76
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
to talk about this perspective of trying
 

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,030
to talk about this perspective of trying
to look at or trying to take a linear

78
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,040
to look at or trying to take a linear
 

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,430
to look at or trying to take a linear
perspective on neural networks and then

80
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
perspective on neural networks and then
 

81
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,830
perspective on neural networks and then
we will see that this linear perspective

82
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
we will see that this linear perspective
 

83
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,990
we will see that this linear perspective
actually gives us a new lens into

84
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
actually gives us a new lens into
 

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,830
actually gives us a new lens into
looking at our optimization algorithms

86
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
looking at our optimization algorithms
 

87
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,150
looking at our optimization algorithms
and so we'll revisit atom and we'll

88
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
and so we'll revisit atom and we'll
 

89
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,110
and so we'll revisit atom and we'll
revisit gradient descent and then we're

90
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
revisit gradient descent and then we're
 

91
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,230
revisit gradient descent and then we're
going to go to thinking about well what

92
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
going to go to thinking about well what
 

93
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,469
going to go to thinking about well what
are the things that We really need to

94
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
are the things that We really need to
 

95
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,029
are the things that We really need to
make these networks trainable. And one

96
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
make these networks trainable. And one
 

97
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,710
make these networks trainable. And one
of the very important things there is

98
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
of the very important things there is
 

99
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,950
of the very important things there is
going to be standardization and

100
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
going to be standardization and
 

101
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,950
going to be standardization and
initialization and making sure that our

102
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
initialization and making sure that our
 

103
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,550
initialization and making sure that our
data is actually in ranges and uh and

104
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
data is actually in ranges and uh and
 

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,390
data is actually in ranges and uh and
and the parameters are such that we can

106
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
and the parameters are such that we can
 

107
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,990
and the parameters are such that we can
actually uh use the expressive power of

108
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
actually uh use the expressive power of
 

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,110
actually uh use the expressive power of
the neural network to get the kind of

110
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
the neural network to get the kind of
 

111
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,870
the neural network to get the kind of
function fitting that we want to get and

112
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
function fitting that we want to get and
 

113
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,749
function fitting that we want to get and
get use the expressive power that uh

114
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
get use the expressive power that uh
 

115
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,909
get use the expressive power that uh
fully. So that's what we're going to be

116
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
fully. So that's what we're going to be
 

117
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,310
fully. So that's what we're going to be
really talking about in uh in lecture

118
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
really talking about in uh in lecture
 

119
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,550
really talking about in uh in lecture
today. Okay. So last time we talked

120
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
today. Okay. So last time we talked
 

121
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,270
today. Okay. So last time we talked
about basically this one uh basic

122
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
about basically this one uh basic
 

123
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,710
about basically this one uh basic
perspective which is that you you let's

124
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:02,720
perspective which is that you you let's
 

125
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,390
perspective which is that you you let's
say you have a network you have some

126
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
say you have a network you have some
 

127
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,189
say you have a network you have some
input X and maybe you have a bunch of

128
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
input X and maybe you have a bunch of
 

129
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:16,070
input X and maybe you have a bunch of
layers.

130
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,080

 

131
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,150

you feed into your linear layer at the

132
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
you feed into your linear layer at the
 

133
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,510
you feed into your linear layer at the
end

134
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520

 

135
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,189

and then maybe you have an output Y.

136
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
and then maybe you have an output Y.
 

137
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,029
and then maybe you have an output Y.
And we said, look, one way to think

138
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
And we said, look, one way to think
 

139
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,870
And we said, look, one way to think
about this neural network is to say all

140
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
about this neural network is to say all
 

141
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,830
about this neural network is to say all
of this nonlinear stuff here, this is

142
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
of this nonlinear stuff here, this is
 

143
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,150
of this nonlinear stuff here, this is
doing a feature extraction

144
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
doing a feature extraction
 

145
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,990
doing a feature extraction
and then we're taking all of these

146
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
and then we're taking all of these
 

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,430
and then we're taking all of these
features and feeding them in to a linear

148
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
features and feeding them in to a linear
 

149
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,350
features and feeding them in to a linear
layer and then fitting that linear

150
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
layer and then fitting that linear
 

151
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,870
layer and then fitting that linear
layer. Just thinking of that as a

152
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
layer. Just thinking of that as a
 

153
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,150
layer. Just thinking of that as a
standard linear problem, right? And

154
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
standard linear problem, right? And
 

155
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,150
standard linear problem, right? And
except instead of saying, oh, we have

156
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
except instead of saying, oh, we have
 

157
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,749
except instead of saying, oh, we have
some features that we have come up with

158
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
some features that we have come up with
 

159
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,990
some features that we have come up with
from some side information, we're going

160
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
from some side information, we're going
 

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,029
from some side information, we're going
to actually use the data to fit and

162
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
to actually use the data to fit and
 

163
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,670
to actually use the data to fit and
understand what the right nonlinear

164
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
understand what the right nonlinear
 

165
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,270
understand what the right nonlinear
features would be. Does everyone

166
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
features would be. Does everyone
 

167
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,430
features would be. Does everyone
remember we talked about that? So this

168
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
remember we talked about that? So this
 

169
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,110
remember we talked about that? So this
yellow part we're just thinking of as a

170
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
yellow part we're just thinking of as a
 

171
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,990
yellow part we're just thinking of as a
feature extractor.

172
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000

 

173
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,589

What I didn't have time to talk about

174
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
What I didn't have time to talk about
 

175
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,710
What I didn't have time to talk about
last time was the second perspective by

176
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
last time was the second perspective by
 

177
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,029
last time was the second perspective by
which we can think of

178
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
which we can think of
 

179
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,110
which we can think of
excuse me by which we can try to think

180
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
excuse me by which we can try to think
 

181
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,510
excuse me by which we can try to think
of a a second linear perspective that we

182
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
of a a second linear perspective that we
 

183
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,469
of a a second linear perspective that we
can take on our uh deep learning

184
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
can take on our uh deep learning
 

185
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,270
can take on our uh deep learning
problem. So for this I want to think

186
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
problem. So for this I want to think
 

187
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,629
problem. So for this I want to think
about our network as a function of both

188
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
about our network as a function of both
 

189
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,270
about our network as a function of both
the input data and the parameters.

190
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
the input data and the parameters.
 

191
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,390
the input data and the parameters.
Right? We're trying to fit the

192
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
Right? We're trying to fit the
 

193
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,309
Right? We're trying to fit the
parameters. So they're also a important

194
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
parameters. So they're also a important
 

195
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,870
parameters. So they're also a important
part of what the neural network is able

196
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
part of what the neural network is able
 

197
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,309
part of what the neural network is able
to express. Right? Of course it's also a

198
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
to express. Right? Of course it's also a
 

199
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,189
to express. Right? Of course it's also a
function of what the input comes in. So

200
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
function of what the input comes in. So
 

201
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,469
function of what the input comes in. So
let's think of this network as function

202
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
let's think of this network as function
 

203
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,309
let's think of this network as function
f of x comma theta. x is your data and

204
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
f of x comma theta. x is your data and
 

205
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,749
f of x comma theta. x is your data and
theta are your parameters. Okay.

206
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
theta are your parameters. Okay.
 

207
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,749
theta are your parameters. Okay.
And now I want to focus on this as a

208
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
And now I want to focus on this as a
 

209
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,150
And now I want to focus on this as a
function of theta even though x is

210
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
function of theta even though x is
 

211
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,790
function of theta even though x is
there. I'm going to kind of sideline

212
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
there. I'm going to kind of sideline
 

213
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,469
there. I'm going to kind of sideline
that just for a minute. Okay.

214
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
that just for a minute. Okay.
 

215
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,390
that just for a minute. Okay.
So let's say we have a network that's

216
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
So let's say we have a network that's
 

217
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,950
So let's say we have a network that's
basically doing some kind of that's

218
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
basically doing some kind of that's
 

219
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,629
basically doing some kind of that's
giving a scalar output. So we're trying

220
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
giving a scalar output. So we're trying
 

221
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,550
giving a scalar output. So we're trying
to say we're trying to do some binary

222
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
to say we're trying to do some binary
 

223
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,309
to say we're trying to do some binary
classification or a linear regression

224
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
classification or a linear regression
 

225
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,230
classification or a linear regression
where we're trying we have a scalar

226
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
where we're trying we have a scalar
 

227
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,270
where we're trying we have a scalar
input and we have a scalar output. Okay.

228
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
input and we have a scalar output. Okay.
 

229
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,550
input and we have a scalar output. Okay.
But let's say we have a bunch of

230
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
But let's say we have a bunch of
 

231
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,309
But let's say we have a bunch of
parameters. So for example like the

232
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
parameters. So for example like the
 

233
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,230
parameters. So for example like the
example that you did in uh your

234
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
example that you did in uh your
 

235
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,550
example that you did in uh your
discussion you have maybe many many

236
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
discussion you have maybe many many
 

237
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,430
discussion you have maybe many many
hidden layers or many many hidden units

238
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
hidden layers or many many hidden units
 

239
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,430
hidden layers or many many hidden units
in one hidden layer but you have a

240
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
in one hidden layer but you have a
 

241
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,589
in one hidden layer but you have a
scalar input and a scalar output. Okay,

242
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
scalar input and a scalar output. Okay,
 

243
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,750
scalar input and a scalar output. Okay,
that's the kind of problem that you can

244
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
that's the kind of problem that you can
 

245
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,110
that's the kind of problem that you can
keep in mind.

246
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120

 

247
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,509

Then what I can do is I can think of

248
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
Then what I can do is I can think of
 

249
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,030
Then what I can do is I can think of
this

250
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
this
 

251
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,190
this
function as a uh linear I can think of

252
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
function as a uh linear I can think of
 

253
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,750
function as a uh linear I can think of
the function of the neural network from

254
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
the function of the neural network from
 

255
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,670
the function of the neural network from
the perspective of linearizing it around

256
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
the perspective of linearizing it around
 

257
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,470
the perspective of linearizing it around
the current parameter values to try and

258
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
the current parameter values to try and
 

259
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,949
the current parameter values to try and
understand what would happen if the

260
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
understand what would happen if the
 

261
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,310
understand what would happen if the
parameter changed just by a little bit.

262
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
parameter changed just by a little bit.
 

263
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,310
parameter changed just by a little bit.
And so what is the tool that we have to

264
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
And so what is the tool that we have to
 

265
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,030
And so what is the tool that we have to
think about when we're looking at okay I

266
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
think about when we're looking at okay I
 

267
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,190
think about when we're looking at okay I
have a function and I want to understand

268
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,200
have a function and I want to understand
 

269
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,430
have a function and I want to understand
what happens to that function when my

270
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
what happens to that function when my
 

271
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,350
what happens to that function when my
input changes a little bit. what is the

272
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
input changes a little bit. what is the
 

273
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,710
input changes a little bit. what is the
what is the thing that we always have

274
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
what is the thing that we always have
 

275
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,990
what is the thing that we always have
and use

276
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
and use
 

277
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,470
and use
>> expansion

278
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:20,480
>> expansion
 

279
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,190
>> expansion
>> tailor expansion right

280
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
>> tailor expansion right
 

281
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,110
>> tailor expansion right
so that's exactly what we're going to

282
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
so that's exactly what we're going to
 

283
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,190
so that's exactly what we're going to
try to do and we're going to say look if

284
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
try to do and we're going to say look if
 

285
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,150
try to do and we're going to say look if
I'm at theta and I'm moving a little bit

286
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
I'm at theta and I'm moving a little bit
 

287
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,110
I'm at theta and I'm moving a little bit
to delta theta which is exactly in some

288
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
to delta theta which is exactly in some
 

289
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,630
to delta theta which is exactly in some
sense what something like gradient

290
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
sense what something like gradient
 

291
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,630
sense what something like gradient
descent is trying to do is I'm trying to

292
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
descent is trying to do is I'm trying to
 

293
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,070
descent is trying to do is I'm trying to
train to understand what is the best

294
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
train to understand what is the best
 

295
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,030
train to understand what is the best
value of theta well I could look at the

296
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
value of theta well I could look at the
 

297
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,550
value of theta well I could look at the
value at f ofx comma theta and then I

298
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
value at f ofx comma theta and then I
 

299
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,590
value at f ofx comma theta and then I
have some correction terms to understand

300
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
have some correction terms to understand
 

301
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,949
have some correction terms to understand
how f ofx theta plus delta theta is

302
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
how f ofx theta plus delta theta is
 

303
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,430
how f ofx theta plus delta theta is
different from fx x comma theta. And so

304
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
different from fx x comma theta. And so
 

305
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,150
different from fx x comma theta. And so
what is the first term here? What is the

306
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
what is the first term here? What is the
 

307
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,710
what is the first term here? What is the
first term in the tailor expansion? It's

308
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
first term in the tailor expansion? It's
 

309
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,829
first term in the tailor expansion? It's
the linear term, right? It's a linear.

310
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
the linear term, right? It's a linear.
 

311
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,310
the linear term, right? It's a linear.
It's basically something that's

312
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
It's basically something that's
 

313
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,030
It's basically something that's
multiplying this delta theta. And in

314
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
multiplying this delta theta. And in
 

315
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,870
multiplying this delta theta. And in
fact, what is multiplying this delta

316
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
fact, what is multiplying this delta
 

317
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,630
fact, what is multiplying this delta
theta? I'm writing this here as an inner

318
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
theta? I'm writing this here as an inner
 

319
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,829
theta? I'm writing this here as an inner
product. This is the gradient

320
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
product. This is the gradient
 

321
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,509
product. This is the gradient
multiplying the delta theta term, right?

322
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
multiplying the delta theta term, right?
 

323
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,110
multiplying the delta theta term, right?
And then what's the term out here going

324
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
And then what's the term out here going
 

325
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,790
And then what's the term out here going
to be?

326
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
to be?
 

327
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,790
to be?
It's going to be a quadratic term. And

328
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
It's going to be a quadratic term. And
 

329
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,470
It's going to be a quadratic term. And
what is the matrix that's going to be in

330
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
what is the matrix that's going to be in
 

331
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,670
what is the matrix that's going to be in
there?

332
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
there?
 

333
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,870
there?
>> It's going to be a hessa. And then we're

334
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
>> It's going to be a hessa. And then we're
 

335
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,870
>> It's going to be a hessa. And then we're
going to have higher order terms, right?

336
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
going to have higher order terms, right?
 

337
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,870
going to have higher order terms, right?
We're not going to think about those at

338
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
We're not going to think about those at
 

339
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,310
We're not going to think about those at
all right now. I'm completely dropping

340
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
all right now. I'm completely dropping
 

341
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,829
all right now. I'm completely dropping
them.

342
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
them.
 

343
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,590
them.
I want to focus only on this um you know

344
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
I want to focus only on this um you know
 

345
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,670
I want to focus only on this um you know
first constant uh term and then this

346
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
first constant uh term and then this
 

347
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,829
first constant uh term and then this
linear term.

348
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
linear term.
 

349
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,590
linear term.
And if I think about this I can think of

350
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
And if I think about this I can think of
 

351
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,030
And if I think about this I can think of
this as essentially a linear

352
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
this as essentially a linear
 

353
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,150
this as essentially a linear
approximation of this network. Right?

354
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
approximation of this network. Right?
 

355
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,790
approximation of this network. Right?
So what is the caveat for me being able

356
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
So what is the caveat for me being able
 

357
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,550
So what is the caveat for me being able
to use this and even

358
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
to use this and even
 

359
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,990
to use this and even
think about this this way

360
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000

 

361
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,550

when I'm making an approximation

362
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
when I'm making an approximation
 

363
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,150
when I'm making an approximation
what is the what do I have to always

364
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
what is the what do I have to always
 

365
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,190
what is the what do I have to always
check

366
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
check
 

367
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,710
check
>> delta

368
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
>> delta
 

369
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,550
>> delta
>> I want to check that delta theta in some

370
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
>> I want to check that delta theta in some
 

371
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,190
>> I want to check that delta theta in some
sense is small right because if I move

372
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,200
sense is small right because if I move
 

373
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,150
sense is small right because if I move
very far away from my initialization

374
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
very far away from my initialization
 

375
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,670
very far away from my initialization
point or wherever my parameters

376
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:19,680
point or wherever my parameters
 

377
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,990
point or wherever my parameters
currently are then this linear

378
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
currently are then this linear
 

379
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,550
currently are then this linear
approximation isn't going to hold.

380
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
approximation isn't going to hold.
 

381
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,509
approximation isn't going to hold.
Right? If I have some function,

382
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
Right? If I have some function,
 

383
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,430
Right? If I have some function,
what the tailor expansion is doing is I

384
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
what the tailor expansion is doing is I
 

385
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,829
what the tailor expansion is doing is I
have some function and I'm taking some

386
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
have some function and I'm taking some
 

387
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,310
have some function and I'm taking some
um local linear approximation to that.

388
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
um local linear approximation to that.
 

389
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,069
um local linear approximation to that.
Right? And so if I move far away, this

390
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
Right? And so if I move far away, this
 

391
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,430
Right? And so if I move far away, this
local linear approximation is going to

392
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
local linear approximation is going to
 

393
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,269
local linear approximation is going to
be bad. These terms are going to start

394
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
be bad. These terms are going to start
 

395
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,829
be bad. These terms are going to start
becoming much larger. So this only holds

396
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:41,839
becoming much larger. So this only holds
 

397
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,389
becoming much larger. So this only holds
true in a particular neighborhood. Okay?

398
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
true in a particular neighborhood. Okay?
 

399
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,190
true in a particular neighborhood. Okay?
And so to be able to use this this uh

400
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
And so to be able to use this this uh
 

401
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,269
And so to be able to use this this uh
this kind of thinking or this kind of

402
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
this kind of thinking or this kind of
 

403
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,190
this kind of thinking or this kind of
linear approximation,

404
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
linear approximation,
 

405
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,990
linear approximation,
we have what is called the lazy training

406
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
we have what is called the lazy training
 

407
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,949
we have what is called the lazy training
assumption. Okay. And what is the lazy

408
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
assumption. Okay. And what is the lazy
 

409
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,949
assumption. Okay. And what is the lazy
training assumption? The lazy training

410
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
training assumption? The lazy training
 

411
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,350
training assumption? The lazy training
assumption says that your weights of

412
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
assumption says that your weights of
 

413
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,310
assumption says that your weights of
your neural network are actually moving

414
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
your neural network are actually moving
 

415
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,389
your neural network are actually moving
by very little bits. They're they're

416
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
by very little bits. They're they're
 

417
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,590
by very little bits. They're they're
moving in a lazy fashion. So whatever

418
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
moving in a lazy fashion. So whatever
 

419
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,750
moving in a lazy fashion. So whatever
training you're doing, your final output

420
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
training you're doing, your final output
 

421
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,150
training you're doing, your final output
or your final weights and parameters are

422
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
or your final weights and parameters are
 

423
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,870
or your final weights and parameters are
actually very close to where they were

424
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
actually very close to where they were
 

425
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,629
actually very close to where they were
initially.

426
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
initially.
 

427
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,350
initially.
And while this might seem kind of wait,

428
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360
And while this might seem kind of wait,
 

429
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,470
And while this might seem kind of wait,
what's the point, right? If you just

430
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
what's the point, right? If you just
 

431
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,069
what's the point, right? If you just
pick some initialization and it works,

432
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
pick some initialization and it works,
 

433
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,350
pick some initialization and it works,
then what's the point? What were you

434
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
then what's the point? What were you
 

435
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,670
then what's the point? What were you
doing with training? Turns out that this

436
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
doing with training? Turns out that this
 

437
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,350
doing with training? Turns out that this
is actually true quite often in

438
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
is actually true quite often in
 

439
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,990
is actually true quite often in
practice. Okay. Um and uh we'll see

440
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
practice. Okay. Um and uh we'll see
 

441
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,310
practice. Okay. Um and uh we'll see
actually we're going to explore uh some

442
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
actually we're going to explore uh some
 

443
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,750
actually we're going to explore uh some
aspects of this in terms of the

444
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
aspects of this in terms of the
 

445
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,389
aspects of this in terms of the
optimization uh algorithms in just a

446
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
optimization uh algorithms in just a
 

447
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,310
optimization uh algorithms in just a
little bit.

448
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
little bit.
 

449
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,470
little bit.
But this is the this is the assumption

450
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
But this is the this is the assumption
 

451
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,710
But this is the this is the assumption
in some sense under which we want to um

452
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
in some sense under which we want to um
 

453
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,910
in some sense under which we want to um
we want to be working.

454
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
we want to be working.
 

455
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,389
we want to be working.
And now the thing that I want to point

456
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
And now the thing that I want to point
 

457
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,829
And now the thing that I want to point
out is if I look at this this linear

458
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
out is if I look at this this linear
 

459
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,870
out is if I look at this this linear
term here

460
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
term here
 

461
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,750
term here
what is exactly this thing right this is

462
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
what is exactly this thing right this is
 

463
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,829
what is exactly this thing right this is
this is my gradient

464
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
this is my gradient
 

465
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,590
this is my gradient
which is basically just the transpose of

466
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:09,600
which is basically just the transpose of
 

467
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,949
which is basically just the transpose of
the derivative. So now we look at this

468
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
the derivative. So now we look at this
 

469
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,629
the derivative. So now we look at this
in our product this is what it looks

470
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
in our product this is what it looks
 

471
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,949
in our product this is what it looks
like right does everyone see that

472
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
like right does everyone see that
 

473
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,430
like right does everyone see that
so now when I look at the entries of

474
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
so now when I look at the entries of
 

475
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,030
so now when I look at the entries of
this I can think of this as essentially

476
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
this I can think of this as essentially
 

477
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,590
this I can think of this as essentially
the features of the data right these are

478
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
the features of the data right these are
 

479
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,389
the features of the data right these are
what are multiplying these entries of

480
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
what are multiplying these entries of
 

481
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,190
what are multiplying these entries of
delta theta so one other perspective for

482
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
delta theta so one other perspective for
 

483
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,509
delta theta so one other perspective for
this is to think of this as the features

484
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519
this is to think of this as the features
 

485
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,910
this is to think of this as the features
so when I have a when I have x w equal

486
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
so when I have a when I have x w equal
 

487
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,430
so when I have a when I have x w equal
to y the columns of x are my features

488
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,440
to y the columns of x are my features
 

489
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,110
to y the columns of x are my features
right for Example, if I'm doing polomial

490
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
right for Example, if I'm doing polomial
 

491
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,750
right for Example, if I'm doing polomial
regression, I would have my features be

492
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
regression, I would have my features be
 

493
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,430
regression, I would have my features be
1 x x^2 x cub x4 so on and so forth. And

494
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
1 x x^2 x cub x4 so on and so forth. And
 

495
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,110
1 x x^2 x cub x4 so on and so forth. And
those would be so I would have a matrix

496
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
those would be so I would have a matrix
 

497
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,949
those would be so I would have a matrix
with 1 x x^2 x cub x for so on. And

498
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
with 1 x x^2 x cub x for so on. And
 

499
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,389
with 1 x x^2 x cub x for so on. And
those would be my features, right?

500
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
those would be my features, right?
 

501
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,069
those would be my features, right?
Instead, but I'm not doing polomial

502
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
Instead, but I'm not doing polomial
 

503
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,629
Instead, but I'm not doing polomial
regression here. Here I'm doing my

504
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
regression here. Here I'm doing my
 

505
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,829
regression here. Here I'm doing my
features are whatever the entries of

506
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
features are whatever the entries of
 

507
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,590
features are whatever the entries of
this derivative are. Okay? So it's a

508
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
this derivative are. Okay? So it's a
 

509
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,430
this derivative are. Okay? So it's a
It's this I'm using the word feature by

510
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
It's this I'm using the word feature by
 

511
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,310
It's this I'm using the word feature by
analogy in some sense. this is a feature

512
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
analogy in some sense. this is a feature
 

513
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,310
analogy in some sense. this is a feature
because it's

514
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
because it's
 

515
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,829
because it's
multiplying this uh the the first order

516
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
multiplying this uh the the first order
 

517
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,389
multiplying this uh the the first order
term right and so this is basically what

518
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
term right and so this is basically what
 

519
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,629
term right and so this is basically what
is changing so when you let's say you

520
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
is changing so when you let's say you
 

521
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,030
is changing so when you let's say you
are trying to do fine-tuning of a

522
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
are trying to do fine-tuning of a
 

523
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,269
are trying to do fine-tuning of a
network right so I have some I've

524
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
network right so I have some I've
 

525
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,350
network right so I have some I've
already have some parameters I've

526
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
already have some parameters I've
 

527
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,430
already have some parameters I've
already learned them and now I'm

528
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
already learned them and now I'm
 

529
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,949
already learned them and now I'm
updating them and changing them with

530
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
updating them and changing them with
 

531
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,230
updating them and changing them with
some uh with some fine-tuning one can

532
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
some uh with some fine-tuning one can
 

533
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,189
some uh with some fine-tuning one can
think of these are the features that

534
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:45,199
think of these are the features that
 

535
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,750
think of these are the features that
you're basically uh that you're that

536
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
you're basically uh that you're that
 

537
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,389
you're basically uh that you're that
you're tuning. Okay.

538
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
you're tuning. Okay.
 

539
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,550
you're tuning. Okay.
Okay. Any questions on this? Basically,

540
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
Okay. Any questions on this? Basically,
 

541
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,629
Okay. Any questions on this? Basically,
what I want you to see is two important

542
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
what I want you to see is two important
 

543
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,990
what I want you to see is two important
things. One is that we have this

544
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
things. One is that we have this
 

545
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,150
things. One is that we have this
nonlinear function. Neural network is

546
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
nonlinear function. Neural network is
 

547
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,230
nonlinear function. Neural network is
fundamentally nonlinear.

548
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
fundamentally nonlinear.
 

549
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,069
fundamentally nonlinear.
But

550
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
But
 

551
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,590
But
I can try to think of it in a linear way

552
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
I can try to think of it in a linear way
 

553
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,310
I can try to think of it in a linear way
by taking this

554
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
by taking this
 

555
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,629
by taking this
uh tailor expansion of the network

556
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
uh tailor expansion of the network
 

557
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,710
uh tailor expansion of the network
around the parameters or around a

558
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
around the parameters or around a
 

559
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,910
around the parameters or around a
particular parameter and then thinking

560
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
particular parameter and then thinking
 

561
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,629
particular parameter and then thinking
of how how my function changes as my

562
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
of how how my function changes as my
 

563
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,949
of how how my function changes as my
parameters change little by little.

564
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959

 

565
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,310

Make sense? Everyone with me there?

566
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
Make sense? Everyone with me there?
 

567
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,949
Make sense? Everyone with me there?
Okay, good.

568
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
Okay, good.
 

569
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,710
Okay, good.
So now can we revisit our descent

570
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
So now can we revisit our descent
 

571
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,110
So now can we revisit our descent
algorithms with taking this perspective?

572
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
algorithms with taking this perspective?
 

573
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,269
algorithms with taking this perspective?
Okay, one thing I should say, um, I

574
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
Okay, one thing I should say, um, I
 

575
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,470
Okay, one thing I should say, um, I
didn't I'm not really going to talk

576
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
didn't I'm not really going to talk
 

577
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,350
didn't I'm not really going to talk
about it, but this is very connected to

578
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
about it, but this is very connected to
 

579
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,629
about it, but this is very connected to
this idea of the neural tangent kernel,

580
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
this idea of the neural tangent kernel,
 

581
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,590
this idea of the neural tangent kernel,
which you may or may not encounter or

582
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
which you may or may not encounter or
 

583
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,949
which you may or may not encounter or
hear about, but this is this idea of

584
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
hear about, but this is this idea of
 

585
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,710
hear about, but this is this idea of
being able to talk about when uh descent

586
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
being able to talk about when uh descent
 

587
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,150
being able to talk about when uh descent
algorithms will converge and give

588
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
algorithms will converge and give
 

589
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,870
algorithms will converge and give
provable guarantees. And thinking about

590
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
provable guarantees. And thinking about
 

591
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,030
provable guarantees. And thinking about
the neural tangent kernel basically

592
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
the neural tangent kernel basically
 

593
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,629
the neural tangent kernel basically
comes from

594
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:06,639

 

595
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,949

thinking about this exact perspective of

596
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:08,959
thinking about this exact perspective of
 

597
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,990
thinking about this exact perspective of
the network as a um uh as a linear

598
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000
the network as a um uh as a linear
 

599
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,670
the network as a um uh as a linear
thinking about the linear approximation

600
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
thinking about the linear approximation
 

601
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,470
thinking about the linear approximation
of the network in exactly this way. And

602
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
of the network in exactly this way. And
 

603
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,389
of the network in exactly this way. And
basically what you can what you can do

604
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:20,399
basically what you can what you can do
 

605
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,590
basically what you can what you can do
and what you can show is that in the

606
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
and what you can show is that in the
 

607
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,389
and what you can show is that in the
limit of infinite width networks so it's

608
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
limit of infinite width networks so it's
 

609
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,389
limit of infinite width networks so it's
a theoretical perspective but as your

610
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
a theoretical perspective but as your
 

611
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,509
a theoretical perspective but as your
networks get wider and wider what ends

612
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
networks get wider and wider what ends
 

613
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,910
networks get wider and wider what ends
up happening is that these features um

614
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:35,920
up happening is that these features um
 

615
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,389
up happening is that these features um
can be thought of in a particular sense.

616
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
can be thought of in a particular sense.
 

617
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,550
can be thought of in a particular sense.
You can you can kind of work the math to

618
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
You can you can kind of work the math to
 

619
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,870
You can you can kind of work the math to
make these into a kernel

620
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
make these into a kernel
 

621
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,990
make these into a kernel
and then you can find this kernel that

622
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
and then you can find this kernel that
 

623
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,990
and then you can find this kernel that
is what matters for your network in this

624
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
is what matters for your network in this
 

625
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,790
is what matters for your network in this
infinite width uh in this infinite width

626
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
infinite width uh in this infinite width
 

627
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,389
infinite width uh in this infinite width
limit. We're not going to talk about it

628
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
limit. We're not going to talk about it
 

629
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,509
limit. We're not going to talk about it
very much in the class but just an FYI

630
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:57,519
very much in the class but just an FYI
 

631
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,790
very much in the class but just an FYI
for you all. If you know this comes up

632
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:00,800
for you all. If you know this comes up
 

633
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,230
for you all. If you know this comes up
when people start talking about neural

634
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240
when people start talking about neural
 

635
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,549
when people start talking about neural
tangent kernels, what you want to think

636
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
tangent kernels, what you want to think
 

637
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,710
tangent kernels, what you want to think
about is you want to think about okay,

638
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
about is you want to think about okay,
 

639
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,710
about is you want to think about okay,
they're taking this linear perspective

640
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
they're taking this linear perspective
 

641
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,590
they're taking this linear perspective
on the network and you're thinking about

642
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
on the network and you're thinking about
 

643
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,029
on the network and you're thinking about
the derivatives as the features. Okay,

644
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
the derivatives as the features. Okay,
 

645
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,750
the derivatives as the features. Okay,
just putting that out there. Okay.

646
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760

 

647
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,990

So

648
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
So
 

649
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,990
So
what I want to do now is I want to say

650
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
what I want to do now is I want to say
 

651
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,950
what I want to do now is I want to say
let me revisit

652
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960

 

653
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,390

Adam.

654
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:40,400

 

655
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,950

Okay. And really I want to revisit Adam

656
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
Okay. And really I want to revisit Adam
 

657
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,230
Okay. And really I want to revisit Adam
as sin SGD. Right? We talked about this

658
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
as sin SGD. Right? We talked about this
 

659
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,110
as sin SGD. Right? We talked about this
last time.

660
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
last time.
 

661
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,310
last time.
Okay. So I have this f ofx

662
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
Okay. So I have this f ofx
 

663
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,190
Okay. So I have this f ofx
comma theta i

664
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
comma theta i
 

665
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,150
comma theta i
and this is f ofx

666
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
and this is f ofx
 

667
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,230
and this is f ofx
comma theta i.

668
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240

 

669
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:35,270

Um,

670
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280

 

671
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,110

Okay,

672
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
Okay,
 

673
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,870
Okay,
I have this tailor expansion

674
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880

 

675
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,750

and what is the fundamental tension when

676
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760
and what is the fundamental tension when
 

677
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,190
and what is the fundamental tension when
we are trying to take a gradient descent

678
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
we are trying to take a gradient descent
 

679
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,270
we are trying to take a gradient descent
or atom or any descent algorithm

680
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
or atom or any descent algorithm
 

681
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,190
or atom or any descent algorithm
perspective.

682
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
perspective.
 

683
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,110
perspective.
Well,

684
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
Well,
 

685
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,870
Well,
what I'm trying to do is, you know,

686
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
what I'm trying to do is, you know,
 

687
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,390
what I'm trying to do is, you know,
gradient descent is saying, well, let me

688
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
gradient descent is saying, well, let me
 

689
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,430
gradient descent is saying, well, let me
look at the locally linear structure of

690
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
look at the locally linear structure of
 

691
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,110
look at the locally linear structure of
this particular function and then let me

692
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
this particular function and then let me
 

693
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,310
this particular function and then let me
try to take a step in the direction that

694
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
try to take a step in the direction that
 

695
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,430
try to take a step in the direction that
is indicated as descending from this

696
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
is indicated as descending from this
 

697
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,909
is indicated as descending from this
local approximation perspective. Right?

698
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
local approximation perspective. Right?
 

699
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,990
local approximation perspective. Right?
So

700
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
So
 

701
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,830
So
what I want to do with gradient descent

702
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
what I want to do with gradient descent
 

703
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,230
what I want to do with gradient descent
is I want to converge to the minimum or

704
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
is I want to converge to the minimum or
 

705
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,230
is I want to converge to the minimum or
wherever I want to converge to very very

706
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,240
wherever I want to converge to very very
 

707
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,230
wherever I want to converge to very very
fast and converging fast means taking

708
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
fast and converging fast means taking
 

709
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,430
fast and converging fast means taking
big steps. Right?

710
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
big steps. Right?
 

711
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,190
big steps. Right?
However, my gradient information is

712
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
However, my gradient information is
 

713
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,990
However, my gradient information is
valid in a local neighborhood. Okay? So

714
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,000
valid in a local neighborhood. Okay? So
 

715
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,110
valid in a local neighborhood. Okay? So
if I take these giant big steps, what's

716
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
if I take these giant big steps, what's
 

717
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,990
if I take these giant big steps, what's
going to happen? I'm going to ruin my

718
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
going to happen? I'm going to ruin my
 

719
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,830
going to happen? I'm going to ruin my
approximation guarantee and so I'm going

720
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
approximation guarantee and so I'm going
 

721
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,350
approximation guarantee and so I'm going
to like you know I'll be taking a step

722
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
to like you know I'll be taking a step
 

723
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,190
to like you know I'll be taking a step
but then my my local linear

724
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
but then my my local linear
 

725
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,789
but then my my local linear
approximation is simply not going to

726
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
approximation is simply not going to
 

727
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,830
approximation is simply not going to
hold true. So that pushes me to take

728
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840
hold true. So that pushes me to take
 

729
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,230
hold true. So that pushes me to take
very small steps right to to make sure

730
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
very small steps right to to make sure
 

731
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,070
very small steps right to to make sure
that my approximation is true. So does

732
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
that my approximation is true. So does
 

733
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,590
that my approximation is true. So does
everyone see the the tension that is

734
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
everyone see the the tension that is
 

735
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,029
everyone see the the tension that is
there between wanting to take larger

736
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
there between wanting to take larger
 

737
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,190
there between wanting to take larger
steps and wanting to take smaller steps.

738
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
steps and wanting to take smaller steps.
 

739
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,270
steps and wanting to take smaller steps.
This is fundamentally kind of the the

740
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
This is fundamentally kind of the the
 

741
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,230
This is fundamentally kind of the the
the

742
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
the
 

743
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:18,230
the
issue. So there's a tension here.

744
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240

 

745
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,230

want

746
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
want
 

747
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,230
want
large steps

748
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240

 

749
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,270

to be able

750
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,280
to be able
 

751
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,990
to be able
to converge

752
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000

 

753
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,870

fast.

754
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
fast.
 

755
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,270
fast.
And I want small steps

756
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280

 

757
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,029

to make sure

758
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039

 

759
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:53,830

uh approximation

760
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:53,840

 

761
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,270

still holds.

762
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,280
still holds.
 

763
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,029
still holds.
Okay.

764
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039

 

765
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,870

So if I wanted to now put my

766
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
So if I wanted to now put my
 

767
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,310
So if I wanted to now put my
optimization hat on,

768
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
optimization hat on,
 

769
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,630
optimization hat on,
what's what are ways in which we could

770
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
what's what are ways in which we could
 

771
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,070
what's what are ways in which we could
try to actually

772
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,080
try to actually
 

773
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:22,549
try to actually
resolve such a tension?

774
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559

 

775
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,310

So maybe actually yeah take a minute and

776
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
So maybe actually yeah take a minute and
 

777
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,149
So maybe actually yeah take a minute and
like talk and try to think about this.

778
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
like talk and try to think about this.
 

779
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,430
like talk and try to think about this.
Take one minute to actually just think

780
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
Take one minute to actually just think
 

781
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,750
Take one minute to actually just think
about it. Feel free to talk and engage

782
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760
about it. Feel free to talk and engage
 

783
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,190
about it. Feel free to talk and engage
engage with the problem. Does is

784
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
engage with the problem. Does is
 

785
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,750
engage with the problem. Does is
everyone clear with the issue?

786
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
everyone clear with the issue?
 

787
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:44,789
everyone clear with the issue?
>> Yeah. Good.

788
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799

 

789
00:21:44,799 --> 00:22:02,149

>> Yeah.

790
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159

 

791
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:22,149

I guess

792
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159

 

793
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:37,590

you

794
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600

 

795
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,470

I think that's

796
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480

 

797
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:53,669

>> Well, I guess

798
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679

 

799
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,870

Okay.

800
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:54,880
Okay.
 

801
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,789
Okay.
>> So, anyone have any particular ideas

802
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:56,799
>> So, anyone have any particular ideas
 

803
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,630
>> So, anyone have any particular ideas
they want to share as to how we could

804
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:58,640
they want to share as to how we could
 

805
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,310
they want to share as to how we could
approach this?

806
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320
approach this?
 

807
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,110
approach this?
>> Yeah.

808
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,120
>> Yeah.
 

809
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,710
>> Yeah.
>> You could just take big steps to start

810
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
>> You could just take big steps to start
 

811
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,310
>> You could just take big steps to start
and then work your way down to smaller

812
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
and then work your way down to smaller
 

813
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,870
and then work your way down to smaller
steps.

814
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:04,880
steps.
 

815
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,470
steps.
>> You could just take big steps to start

816
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
>> You could just take big steps to start
 

817
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,149
>> You could just take big steps to start
and work your way down to smaller steps.

818
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
and work your way down to smaller steps.
 

819
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,750
and work your way down to smaller steps.
That's that's a great idea. And in some

820
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:09,760
That's that's a great idea. And in some
 

821
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,789
That's that's a great idea. And in some
sense, gradient descent, when you think

822
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
sense, gradient descent, when you think
 

823
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,549
sense, gradient descent, when you think
about it in the traditional convex

824
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
about it in the traditional convex
 

825
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,870
about it in the traditional convex
perspective, is essentially trying to do

826
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
perspective, is essentially trying to do
 

827
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,470
perspective, is essentially trying to do
that, right? because you're saying that

828
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
that, right? because you're saying that
 

829
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,070
that, right? because you're saying that
as you get closer to your optimum, your

830
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
as you get closer to your optimum, your
 

831
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,430
as you get closer to your optimum, your
gradient is becoming closer and closer

832
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
gradient is becoming closer and closer
 

833
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,190
gradient is becoming closer and closer
to zero.

834
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
to zero.
 

835
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,950
to zero.
Um, and so even though you have a

836
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:24,960
Um, and so even though you have a
 

837
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,549
Um, and so even though you have a
constant step size and gradient descent,

838
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559
constant step size and gradient descent,
 

839
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,710
constant step size and gradient descent,
it converges because as your gradient is

840
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
it converges because as your gradient is
 

841
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,070
it converges because as your gradient is
becoming closer to the optimum, it's

842
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,080
becoming closer to the optimum, it's
 

843
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,870
becoming closer to the optimum, it's
becoming closer to zero. So yes,

844
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:32,880
becoming closer to zero. So yes,
 

845
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,430
becoming closer to zero. So yes,
absolutely. And so there is this idea of

846
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,440
absolutely. And so there is this idea of
 

847
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,430
absolutely. And so there is this idea of
learning rate schedules where you

848
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
learning rate schedules where you
 

849
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,190
learning rate schedules where you
basically keep changing your learning

850
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,200
basically keep changing your learning
 

851
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,149
basically keep changing your learning
rate um to be able to get to

852
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
rate um to be able to get to
 

853
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,310
rate um to be able to get to
convergence. So absolutely that's a very

854
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
convergence. So absolutely that's a very
 

855
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,990
convergence. So absolutely that's a very
valid idea and that is something that is

856
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
valid idea and that is something that is
 

857
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,630
valid idea and that is something that is
very much done in practice. So that's

858
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:48,640
very much done in practice. So that's
 

859
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,070
very much done in practice. So that's
not what we're going to do today or

860
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
not what we're going to do today or
 

861
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,350
not what we're going to do today or
that's not the perspective I want to

862
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
that's not the perspective I want to
 

863
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,310
that's not the perspective I want to
take today.

864
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
take today.
 

865
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,789
take today.
>> Yeah.

866
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
>> Yeah.
 

867
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,149
>> Yeah.
>> I would see if there's some way that we

868
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
>> I would see if there's some way that we
 

869
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,870
>> I would see if there's some way that we
could bound or or get some analysis of

870
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:58,880
could bound or or get some analysis of
 

871
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,270
could bound or or get some analysis of
the error of our approximation and then

872
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,280
the error of our approximation and then
 

873
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,750
the error of our approximation and then
see if we could like we can get some

874
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760
see if we could like we can get some
 

875
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,430
see if we could like we can get some
bounds on that error and maybe determine

876
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
bounds on that error and maybe determine
 

877
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,110
bounds on that error and maybe determine
the largest step size we can take within

878
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120
the largest step size we can take within
 

879
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,390
the largest step size we can take within
a certain error.

880
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
a certain error.
 

881
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,390
a certain error.
>> Yeah. So we're not going to do exactly

882
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
>> Yeah. So we're not going to do exactly
 

883
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,310
>> Yeah. So we're not going to do exactly
that but we're going to do something in

884
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
that but we're going to do something in
 

885
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,549
that but we're going to do something in
that basic direction. So the idea was to

886
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
that basic direction. So the idea was to
 

887
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,669
that basic direction. So the idea was to
say you know try to understand the

888
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
say you know try to understand the
 

889
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,510
say you know try to understand the
trade-offs of the approximation and say

890
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
trade-offs of the approximation and say
 

891
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,669
trade-offs of the approximation and say
like what's the best you can do given

892
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
like what's the best you can do given
 

893
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:33,590
like what's the best you can do given
some constraints essentially. Yeah.

894
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600

 

895
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,269

>> Yeah. That's a great idea. So you would

896
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
>> Yeah. That's a great idea. So you would
 

897
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,350
>> Yeah. That's a great idea. So you would
try try to understand the nature or the

898
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
try try to understand the nature or the
 

899
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,590
try try to understand the nature or the
curvature of the function and the

900
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,600
curvature of the function and the
 

901
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,470
curvature of the function and the
geometry that is actually mattering. We

902
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:42,480
geometry that is actually mattering. We
 

903
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,830
geometry that is actually mattering. We
would love to do that but sometimes it

904
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:43,840
would love to do that but sometimes it
 

905
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,070
would love to do that but sometimes it
can be very hard to understand what that

906
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
can be very hard to understand what that
 

907
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,830
can be very hard to understand what that
local geometry actually is. And so we

908
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
local geometry actually is. And so we
 

909
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,830
local geometry actually is. And so we
want to be able to do things that might

910
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:49,840
want to be able to do things that might
 

911
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,990
want to be able to do things that might
not require us to actually do that but

912
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
not require us to actually do that but
 

913
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,070
not require us to actually do that but
it's a totally great approach if we

914
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
it's a totally great approach if we
 

915
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,070
it's a totally great approach if we
could actually do that.

916
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,080
could actually do that.
 

917
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,470
could actually do that.
So what we're going to do today is we're

918
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
So what we're going to do today is we're
 

919
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,470
So what we're going to do today is we're
going to you know take this optimization

920
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
going to you know take this optimization
 

921
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,990
going to you know take this optimization
perspective

922
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
perspective
 

923
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,870
perspective
and so we're going to say well I want to

924
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
and so we're going to say well I want to
 

925
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,310
and so we're going to say well I want to
make sure that my step is not too big

926
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,320
make sure that my step is not too big
 

927
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,870
make sure that my step is not too big
and so I'm going to say what if I put a

928
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
and so I'm going to say what if I put a
 

929
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,510
and so I'm going to say what if I put a
constraint on the size of the step okay

930
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
constraint on the size of the step okay
 

931
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,590
constraint on the size of the step okay
and I say find the best step but within

932
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
and I say find the best step but within
 

933
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:27,830
and I say find the best step but within
some bound okay so the idea

934
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:27,840

 

935
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,789

is to bound

936
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
is to bound
 

937
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,149
is to bound
the size

938
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
the size
 

939
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,710
the size
of your step.

940
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:36,720
of your step.
 

941
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,510
of your step.
Okay. So for example, I take my delta

942
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:39,520
Okay. So for example, I take my delta
 

943
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,269
Okay. So for example, I take my delta
theta and I take some norm on it and I

944
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:43,279
theta and I take some norm on it and I
 

945
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,950
theta and I take some norm on it and I
want to make sure that it is smaller

946
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
want to make sure that it is smaller
 

947
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,909
want to make sure that it is smaller
than some ADA. And so I say look within

948
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
than some ADA. And so I say look within
 

949
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,630
than some ADA. And so I say look within
this maybe try to find the biggest step

950
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:52,640
this maybe try to find the biggest step
 

951
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,029
this maybe try to find the biggest step
right try to find the best step but

952
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,039
right try to find the best step but
 

953
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,950
right try to find the best step but
don't go too far otherwise you're going

954
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
don't go too far otherwise you're going
 

955
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,350
don't go too far otherwise you're going
to lose the properties of the

956
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
to lose the properties of the
 

957
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,310
to lose the properties of the
approximation okay

958
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
approximation okay
 

959
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,430
approximation okay
and now I want to use this to write a

960
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
and now I want to use this to write a
 

961
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,750
and now I want to use this to write a
constrained optimization problem for

962
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:09,760
constrained optimization problem for
 

963
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,669
constrained optimization problem for
minimizing my function but I want to

964
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
minimizing my function but I want to
 

965
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,070
minimizing my function but I want to
take this local linear perspective on my

966
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
take this local linear perspective on my
 

967
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,510
take this local linear perspective on my
neural network. Okay. So the

968
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
neural network. Okay. So the
 

969
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,630
neural network. Okay. So the
optimization function I want to write

970
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
optimization function I want to write
 

971
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:46,149
optimization function I want to write
is the following.

972
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:46,159

 

973
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:53,750

Maybe I want to

974
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760

 

975
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:24,950

this here.

976
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:24,960

 

977
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,789

Okay. So what have I written here? I've

978
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:26,799
Okay. So what have I written here? I've
 

979
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,269
Okay. So what have I written here? I've
just written out

980
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
just written out
 

981
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,870
just written out
my linear approximation. So let's say

982
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:30,880
my linear approximation. So let's say
 

983
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,230
my linear approximation. So let's say
I'm doing some kind of descent

984
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
I'm doing some kind of descent
 

985
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,029
I'm doing some kind of descent
algorithm. So theta I is where I'm

986
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
algorithm. So theta I is where I'm
 

987
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,470
algorithm. So theta I is where I'm
currently at. So maybe I should write

988
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
currently at. So maybe I should write
 

989
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,149
currently at. So maybe I should write
this out here too just to recall.

990
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159

 

991
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,110

Call

992
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,120

 

993
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,669

theta i + 1 is equal to

994
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
theta i + 1 is equal to
 

995
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,310
theta i + 1 is equal to
theta i - aa * whatever your step is

996
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
theta i - aa * whatever your step is
 

997
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,909
theta i - aa * whatever your step is
okay

998
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
okay
 

999
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,190
okay
and this step here that we take is

1000
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
and this step here that we take is
 

1001
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,669
and this step here that we take is
typically

1002
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:03,679
typically
 

1003
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,870
typically
something in the direction of the

1004
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:04,880
something in the direction of the
 

1005
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,110
something in the direction of the
gradient right but depending on exactly

1006
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
gradient right but depending on exactly
 

1007
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,190
gradient right but depending on exactly
whether you're doing gradient descent or

1008
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,200
whether you're doing gradient descent or
 

1009
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,350
whether you're doing gradient descent or
stoastic gradient descent or momentum or

1010
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:11,360
stoastic gradient descent or momentum or
 

1011
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,350
stoastic gradient descent or momentum or
atom or whatever that step is is

1012
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,360
atom or whatever that step is is
 

1013
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,389
atom or whatever that step is is
different, right? That's the whole

1014
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399
different, right? That's the whole
 

1015
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,590
different, right? That's the whole
that's that's how these update

1016
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:15,600
that's that's how these update
 

1017
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,070
that's that's how these update
algorithms differ. Okay,

1018
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
algorithms differ. Okay,
 

1019
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,070
algorithms differ. Okay,
so here what I've done is I've said I

1020
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,080
so here what I've done is I've said I
 

1021
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,110
so here what I've done is I've said I
just want to take this linear

1022
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
just want to take this linear
 

1023
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,710
just want to take this linear
approximation

1024
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720
approximation
 

1025
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,789
approximation
and I'm looking at basically the average

1026
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799
and I'm looking at basically the average
 

1027
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,750
and I'm looking at basically the average
over all of my data points. Okay, so

1028
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
over all of my data points. Okay, so
 

1029
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,269
over all of my data points. Okay, so
these XL's is what I'm averaging over.

1030
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:35,279
these XL's is what I'm averaging over.
 

1031
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,909
these XL's is what I'm averaging over.
So now when I look at this,

1032
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:37,919
So now when I look at this,
 

1033
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,750
So now when I look at this,
there's something here that I haven't

1034
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760
there's something here that I haven't
 

1035
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,750
there's something here that I haven't
quite specified yet.

1036
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:43,760
quite specified yet.
 

1037
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,190
quite specified yet.
What is the thing that I haven't quite

1038
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,200
What is the thing that I haven't quite
 

1039
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,710
What is the thing that I haven't quite
specified?

1040
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720

 

1041
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,789

Like I've I've handwaved one thing.

1042
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:52,799
Like I've I've handwaved one thing.
 

1043
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,510
Like I've I've handwaved one thing.
>> Yeah.

1044
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:55,520
>> Yeah.
 

1045
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,950
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. I'm just using the um standard

1046
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
>> Okay. I'm just using the um standard
 

1047
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,269
>> Okay. I'm just using the um standard
uklidian inner product. So good

1048
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
uklidian inner product. So good
 

1049
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,630
uklidian inner product. So good
question, but I'm just using the

1050
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
question, but I'm just using the
 

1051
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,750
question, but I'm just using the
standard one.

1052
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:05,760
standard one.
 

1053
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,310
standard one.
Yes.

1054
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,320
Yes.
 

1055
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,070
Yes.
>> Higher order terms for the expansion.

1056
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:08,080
>> Higher order terms for the expansion.
 

1057
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,230
>> Higher order terms for the expansion.
>> Higher order terms. Yes. I'm I'm I'm

1058
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,240
>> Higher order terms. Yes. I'm I'm I'm
 

1059
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,389
>> Higher order terms. Yes. I'm I'm I'm
ignoring those.

1060
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
ignoring those.
 

1061
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,389
ignoring those.
Both of those are are are indeed things

1062
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
Both of those are are are indeed things
 

1063
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,710
Both of those are are are indeed things
that I am a little bit handwaving.

1064
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720
that I am a little bit handwaving.
 

1065
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,830
that I am a little bit handwaving.
There's one more thing that I'm

1066
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
There's one more thing that I'm
 

1067
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,510
There's one more thing that I'm
handwaving.

1068
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:19,520
handwaving.
 

1069
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,510
handwaving.
Um, and that is basically I haven't

1070
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
Um, and that is basically I haven't
 

1071
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,830
Um, and that is basically I haven't
really told you what norm I'm using

1072
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:23,840
really told you what norm I'm using
 

1073
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,710
really told you what norm I'm using
here, right? Uh, there's many different

1074
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:26,720
here, right? Uh, there's many different
 

1075
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,630
here, right? Uh, there's many different
norms that I could use or I could want

1076
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:28,640
norms that I could use or I could want
 

1077
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,110
norms that I could use or I could want
to use. Okay. So, when I say that I

1078
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,120
to use. Okay. So, when I say that I
 

1079
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,230
to use. Okay. So, when I say that I
don't want I want to make sure that my

1080
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,240
don't want I want to make sure that my
 

1081
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,789
don't want I want to make sure that my
step isn't too big. Well, I can think of

1082
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:34,799
step isn't too big. Well, I can think of
 

1083
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,669
step isn't too big. Well, I can think of
this the standard kind of when you don't

1084
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:37,679
this the standard kind of when you don't
 

1085
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,269
this the standard kind of when you don't
define your norm. The standard thing you

1086
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
define your norm. The standard thing you
 

1087
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,950
define your norm. The standard thing you
think about is what happens if you take

1088
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
think about is what happens if you take
 

1089
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,510
think about is what happens if you take
the two norm and we'll talk about that.

1090
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
the two norm and we'll talk about that.
 

1091
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,269
the two norm and we'll talk about that.
But if you remember, there's actually

1092
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
But if you remember, there's actually
 

1093
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,710
But if you remember, there's actually
many many different norms that you could

1094
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:46,720
many many different norms that you could
 

1095
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,990
many many different norms that you could
think about, right? So if you want to

1096
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
think about, right? So if you want to
 

1097
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,750
think about, right? So if you want to
think about it in a not changing too

1098
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,760
think about it in a not changing too
 

1099
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,230
think about it in a not changing too
much perspective, one natural way to

1100
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:54,240
much perspective, one natural way to
 

1101
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,149
much perspective, one natural way to
think about it might be to think about

1102
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
think about it might be to think about
 

1103
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,310
think about it might be to think about
actually the infinity norm, right? What

1104
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
actually the infinity norm, right? What
 

1105
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,630
actually the infinity norm, right? What
does the infinity norm say? The infinity

1106
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:00,640
does the infinity norm say? The infinity
 

1107
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,389
does the infinity norm say? The infinity
norm says look at the vector on a

1108
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:02,399
norm says look at the vector on a
 

1109
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,630
norm says look at the vector on a
coordinate by coordinate basis and make

1110
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:04,640
coordinate by coordinate basis and make
 

1111
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,350
coordinate by coordinate basis and make
sure that no particular coordinate is

1112
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,360
sure that no particular coordinate is
 

1113
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,750
sure that no particular coordinate is
larger than this. Right? So the infinity

1114
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:09,760
larger than this. Right? So the infinity
 

1115
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,110
larger than this. Right? So the infinity
norm is the maximum of for of all of

1116
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
norm is the maximum of for of all of
 

1117
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,230
norm is the maximum of for of all of
your entries. Okay, maximum and absolute

1118
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,240
your entries. Okay, maximum and absolute
 

1119
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,110
your entries. Okay, maximum and absolute
value.

1120
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,120

 

1121
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,389

So this is just saying this is the max

1122
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:28,399
So this is just saying this is the max
 

1123
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,710
So this is just saying this is the max
over

1124
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:30,720
over
 

1125
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,590
over
uh

1126
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:33,600

should be less than equal to and max
 

1133
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,149
should be less than equal to and max

1134
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:46,159

1135

Question.

1138
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
Question.

Question.
understanding correctly.

1140
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,320

1141
00:30:50,320 --> 00:31:01,350

>> Yes.

1142
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:01,360

 

1143
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:10,389

this linearizing

1144
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:10,399

 

1145
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,789

whatever

1146
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
whatever
 

1147
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,990
whatever
is

1148
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,000

 

1149
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,830

trying to minimize a loss function.

1150
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,840
trying to minimize a loss function.
 

1151
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:26,870
trying to minimize a loss function.
Um,

1152
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:26,880

 

1153
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,269

so, uh, yes, I'm like,

1154
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:31,279
so, uh, yes, I'm like,
 

1155
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,549
so, uh, yes, I'm like,
uh, yes, I am, uh, doing a little bit

1156
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:34,559
uh, yes, I am, uh, doing a little bit
 

1157
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,669
uh, yes, I am, uh, doing a little bit
of, uh, I didn't I didn't set this up

1158
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
of, uh, I didn't I didn't set this up
 

1159
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,549
of, uh, I didn't I didn't set this up
correctly. So, yes, here I'm I'm doing a

1160
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
correctly. So, yes, here I'm I'm doing a
 

1161
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,710
correctly. So, yes, here I'm I'm doing a
little bit of bad notation. I guess I'm

1162
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
little bit of bad notation. I guess I'm
 

1163
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,310
little bit of bad notation. I guess I'm
thinking of f really as the loss

1164
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
thinking of f really as the loss
 

1165
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,789
thinking of f really as the loss
function. Uh so I should not I should

1166
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
function. Uh so I should not I should
 

1167
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,950
function. Uh so I should not I should
not have used that f in the neural

1168
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
not have used that f in the neural
 

1169
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,830
not have used that f in the neural
network sense earlier

1170
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
network sense earlier
 

1171
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,509
network sense earlier
but I'm really thinking about how is the

1172
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:53,519
but I'm really thinking about how is the
 

1173
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,630
but I'm really thinking about how is the
loss function changing given the uh

1174
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:58,640
loss function changing given the uh
 

1175
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,870
loss function changing given the uh
yeah maybe I should have called this L.

1176
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
yeah maybe I should have called this L.
 

1177
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,710
yeah maybe I should have called this L.
Okay forgive me I should have called

1178
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:04,720
Okay forgive me I should have called
 

1179
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,990
Okay forgive me I should have called
this L but I I used F. Yes

1180
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,000
this L but I I used F. Yes
 

1181
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,830
this L but I I used F. Yes

1190
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
optimal vector. Um, but we're bounding
 

1191
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,710

only the infinity norm of this.

1192
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720

 

1193
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,350

Okay,

1194
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:31,360
Okay,
 

1195
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,630
Okay,
clear. Great question. Thank you for

1196
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
clear. Great question. Thank you for
 

1197
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:43,590
clear. Great question. Thank you for
pointing that out.

1198
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:43,600

 

1199
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,750

Okay. So now when I want to do this, I

1200
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:45,760
Okay. So now when I want to do this, I
 

1201
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,750
Okay. So now when I want to do this, I
want I want to do this optimization.

1202
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:49,760

 

1203
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,149

So I'm looking at this and is there a

1204
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:52,159
So I'm looking at this and is there a
 

1205
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,950
So I'm looking at this and is there a
term that doesn't matter here?

1206
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
term that doesn't matter here?
 

1207
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,789
term that doesn't matter here?
This term clearly doesn't depend on

1208
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:56,799
This term clearly doesn't depend on
 

1209
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,789
This term clearly doesn't depend on
delta theta, right? So it's not going to

1210
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
delta theta, right? So it's not going to
 

1211
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,029
delta theta, right? So it's not going to
affect the argument of this. So I can

1212
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:01,039
affect the argument of this. So I can
 

1213
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,870
affect the argument of this. So I can
essentially just completely drop this

1214
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:04,880
essentially just completely drop this
 

1215
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,870
essentially just completely drop this
from my optimization. It doesn't matter

1216
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:06,880
from my optimization. It doesn't matter
 

1217
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,549
from my optimization. It doesn't matter
at all in terms of finding the argument.

1218
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:08,559
at all in terms of finding the argument.
 

1219
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,470
at all in terms of finding the argument.
It will matter for the minimum value,

1220
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,480
It will matter for the minimum value,
 

1221
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,549
It will matter for the minimum value,
but the argument simply doesn't care.

1222
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:12,559
but the argument simply doesn't care.
 

1223
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,149
but the argument simply doesn't care.
Okay. So I can rewrite this as just

1224
00:33:18,149 --> 00:33:18,159
Okay. So I can rewrite this as just
 

1225
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,909
Okay. So I can rewrite this as just
the argument of just this second term.

1226
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:21,919
the argument of just this second term.
 

1227
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,509
the argument of just this second term.
Okay.

1228
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:23,519
Okay.
 

1229
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,990
Okay.
But now when I look at this I have this

1230
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
But now when I look at this I have this
 

1231
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,350
But now when I look at this I have this
summation here

1232
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
summation here
 

1233
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,750
summation here
and this inner product over here. Okay.

1234
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:33,760
and this inner product over here. Okay.
 

1235
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,350
and this inner product over here. Okay.
So summation inner product but the inner

1236
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,360
So summation inner product but the inner
 

1237
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,830
So summation inner product but the inner
product is basically linear right. So

1238
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
product is basically linear right. So
 

1239
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,070
product is basically linear right. So
what I can do is I can take this

1240
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,080
what I can do is I can take this
 

1241
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,310
what I can do is I can take this
summation inside the inner product.

1242
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,320
summation inside the inner product.
 

1243
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,430
summation inside the inner product.
Right? This L is only varying in the

1244
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
Right? This L is only varying in the
 

1245
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,669
Right? This L is only varying in the
first term. Delta theta is the same for

1246
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
first term. Delta theta is the same for
 

1247
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,350
first term. Delta theta is the same for
everything. So I can rewrite this as

1248
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:53,360
everything. So I can rewrite this as
 

1249
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,750
everything. So I can rewrite this as
argument

1250
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:57,760

 

1251
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:05,029

delta theta

1252
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039

 

1253
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,789

um

1254
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:06,799
um
 

1255
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,270

1261
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:47,030

I'm just

1262
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,040

 

1263
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,710

Okay.

1264
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:52,720

 

1265
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,270

And now when I look at this,

1266
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,280

 

1267
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,069

is there something that we can we can

1268
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:00,079
is there something that we can we can
 

1269
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,829
is there something that we can we can
notice when we think about this?

1270
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:03,839
notice when we think about this?
 

1271
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,589
notice when we think about this?
So actually I'll give you a minute to to

1272
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:05,599
So actually I'll give you a minute to to
 

1273
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,510
So actually I'll give you a minute to to
think about what what this inner product

1274
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,520
think about what what this inner product
 

1275
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,710
think about what what this inner product
is doing. And if there's something you

1276
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:08,720
is doing. And if there's something you
 

1277
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,109
is doing. And if there's something you
can notice about what what you can say

1278
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,119
can notice about what what you can say
 

1279
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,710
can notice about what what you can say
about this optimization, take just one

1280
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
about this optimization, take just one
 

1281
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,710
about this optimization, take just one
minute to think about it.

1282
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:18,720

 

1283
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:36,550

or feel free to talk.

1284
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:36,560

 

1285
00:35:36,560 --> 00:36:28,550

Finally,

1286
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:28,560

 

1287
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,470

Okay. So, what I want to think about

1288
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:30,480
Okay. So, what I want to think about
 

1289
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,069
Okay. So, what I want to think about
here is when I'm looking at this

1290
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
here is when I'm looking at this
 

1291
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,310
here is when I'm looking at this
This is an inner product, right? So

1292
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,320
This is an inner product, right? So
 

1293
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,790
This is an inner product, right? So
these are two vectors

1294
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:38,800
these are two vectors
 

1295
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,750
these are two vectors
and here I have a constraint here. This

1296
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:41,760
and here I have a constraint here. This
 

1297
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,030
and here I have a constraint here. This
constraint is a function of is is

1298
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,040
constraint is a function of is is
 

1299
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,030
constraint is a function of is is
basically it's an entry-wise constraint,

1300
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,040
basically it's an entry-wise constraint,
 

1301
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,750
basically it's an entry-wise constraint,
right? But this is actually an

1302
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:49,760
right? But this is actually an
 

1303
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,150
right? But this is actually an
entry-wise sum. So I have the first

1304
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,160
entry-wise sum. So I have the first
 

1305
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,750
entry-wise sum. So I have the first
entry of this times the first entry of

1306
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:53,760
entry of this times the first entry of
 

1307
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,870
entry of this times the first entry of
this, the second entry of this, the

1308
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:54,880
this, the second entry of this, the
 

1309
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,150
this, the second entry of this, the
second time the second entry of this. So

1310
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
second time the second entry of this. So
 

1311
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,910
second time the second entry of this. So
I can rewrite this whole thing as an

1312
00:36:59,910 --> 00:36:59,920
I can rewrite this whole thing as an
 

1313
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,150
I can rewrite this whole thing as an
argument.

1314
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,160

 

1315
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,109

um over the sum of j

1316
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:09,119
um over the sum of j
 

1317
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,550
um over the sum of j
1 / n whatever this whole thing is. So

1318
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,560
1 / n whatever this whole thing is. So
 

1319
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:24,550
1 / n whatever this whole thing is. So
maybe I can just copy this thing.

1320
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:24,560

 

1321
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,270

And then I want to look at

1322
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,280

 

1323
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,870

the J entry of this vector

1324
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:34,880
the J entry of this vector
 

1325
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:45,109
the J entry of this vector
and times the J entry

1326
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:45,119

 

1327
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,550

of this

1328
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:48,560

 

1329
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,109

right and I'm just writing out the inner

1330
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:51,119
right and I'm just writing out the inner
 

1331
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,470
right and I'm just writing out the inner
product element by element wise And now

1332
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:54,480
product element by element wise And now
 

1333
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,230
product element by element wise And now
I'm going to write this infinity norm as

1334
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:56,240
I'm going to write this infinity norm as
 

1335
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,109
I'm going to write this infinity norm as
saying for every J I want the absolute

1336
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119
saying for every J I want the absolute
 

1337
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,390
saying for every J I want the absolute
value of delta theta to be less than or

1338
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
value of delta theta to be less than or
 

1339
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,750
value of delta theta to be less than or
equal to ADA. Okay.

1340
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:05,760
equal to ADA. Okay.
 

1341
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,550
equal to ADA. Okay.
So now I have constraints here on every

1342
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:08,560
So now I have constraints here on every
 

1343
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:19,510
So now I have constraints here on every
single entry I should say sorry theta J.

1344
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,520

 

1345
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,990

I have constraints here on every entry

1346
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:24,000
I have constraints here on every entry
 

1347
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,550
I have constraints here on every entry
and I've pulled out every entry of this

1348
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:26,560
and I've pulled out every entry of this
 

1349
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,270
and I've pulled out every entry of this
vector here. So this I've basically the

1350
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:29,280
vector here. So this I've basically the
 

1351
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,230
vector here. So this I've basically the
way writing it this way we decouple the

1352
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:32,240
way writing it this way we decouple the
 

1353
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,470
way writing it this way we decouple the
problems

1354
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:34,480
problems
 

1355
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,750
problems
into individual optimization problems on

1356
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:37,760
into individual optimization problems on
 

1357
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,910
into individual optimization problems on
every single

1358
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:39,920
every single
 

1359
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,670
every single
uh entry of the vector delta theta right

1360
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:43,680
uh entry of the vector delta theta right
 

1361
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,310
uh entry of the vector delta theta right
because I want to minimize this thing

1362
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,320
because I want to minimize this thing
 

1363
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,109
because I want to minimize this thing
but my constraints are my my my my the

1364
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:49,119
but my constraints are my my my my the
 

1365
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,470
but my constraints are my my my my the
different things that I'm optimizing

1366
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:50,480
different things that I'm optimizing
 

1367
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,310
different things that I'm optimizing
over the entries of delta theta are no

1368
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,320
over the entries of delta theta are no
 

1369
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,710
over the entries of delta theta are no
longer coupled together

1370
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:54,720
longer coupled together
 

1371
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,270
longer coupled together
right because I have I can rewrite it as

1372
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,280
right because I have I can rewrite it as
 

1373
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,750
right because I have I can rewrite it as
a constraint on every single entry and

1374
00:38:59,750 --> 00:38:59,760
a constraint on every single entry and
 

1375
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,750
a constraint on every single entry and
now I can just optimize each do each of

1376
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:01,760
now I can just optimize each do each of
 

1377
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,470
now I can just optimize each do each of
these optimizations one by one. Does

1378
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,480
these optimizations one by one. Does
 

1379
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,109
these optimizations one by one. Does
that make sense to everyone?

1380
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:07,119
that make sense to everyone?
 

1381
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,510
that make sense to everyone?
Okay. So I can just rewrite this. So do

1382
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
Okay. So I can just rewrite this. So do
 

1383
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:29,510
Okay. So I can just rewrite this. So do
each optimization individually.

1384
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:29,520

 

1385
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,230

And then what I can get

1386
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,240

 

1387
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:46,950

is argument.

1388
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:46,960

 

1389
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,470

I'm just going to call this the gradient

1390
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
I'm just going to call this the gradient
 

1391
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,790
I'm just going to call this the gradient
with respect to theta of fbatch. So I

1392
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:50,800
with respect to theta of fbatch. So I
 

1393
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,069
with respect to theta of fbatch. So I
just don't have to write this sum out

1394
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:52,079
just don't have to write this sum out
 

1395
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,589
just don't have to write this sum out
again. just this whole thing I'm calling

1396
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:53,599
again. just this whole thing I'm calling
 

1397
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,510
again. just this whole thing I'm calling
that

1398
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:57,520

 

1399
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:06,310

>> yes

1400
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:06,320

 

1401
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,349

I'm calling

1402
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:09,359
I'm calling
 

1403
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,349
I'm calling
this thing

1404
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
this thing
 

1405
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,710
this thing
fbatch

1406
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:16,720

 

1407
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,589

f

1408
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:21,599

 

1409
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:45,430

gradient And on that patch.

1410
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440

 

1411
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,829

Okay.

1412
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:47,839
Okay.
 

1413
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,069
Okay.
But now this optimization problem

1414
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,079
But now this optimization problem
 

1415
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,470
But now this optimization problem
I kind of know how to solve, right? So

1416
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:54,480
I kind of know how to solve, right? So
 

1417
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,950
I kind of know how to solve, right? So
I'm saying look I can choose theta to be

1418
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:56,960
I'm saying look I can choose theta to be
 

1419
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,870
I'm saying look I can choose theta to be
anything from minus ADA.

1420
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:00,880
anything from minus ADA.
 

1421
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,790
anything from minus ADA.
Minus 8 is the smallest it can be

1422
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:04,800
Minus 8 is the smallest it can be
 

1423
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,670
Minus 8 is the smallest it can be
and the largest it can be is plus ADA.

1424
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:09,680

 

1425
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,309

And I have everything of every one of

1426
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:12,319
And I have everything of every one of
 

1427
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,309
And I have everything of every one of
these is scaled

1428
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:14,319
these is scaled
 

1429
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,990
these is scaled
by this fbatch. Right? this gradient of

1430
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:18,000
by this fbatch. Right? this gradient of
 

1431
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,030
by this fbatch. Right? this gradient of
fbatch.

1432
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,040

 

1433
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,069

So now what ch if I want to now minimize

1434
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:24,079
So now what ch if I want to now minimize
 

1435
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,710
So now what ch if I want to now minimize
this thing how do I decide

1436
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:26,720
this thing how do I decide
 

1437
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,470
this thing how do I decide
which to choose

1438
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:32,480

 

1439
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,630

if I have yeah at the back

1440
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:34,640
if I have yeah at the back
 

1441
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,950
if I have yeah at the back
>> check the sign of the gradient

1442
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:36,960
>> check the sign of the gradient
 

1443
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,230
>> check the sign of the gradient
>> yeah you just check the sign of the

1444
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:38,240
>> yeah you just check the sign of the
 

1445
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,270
>> yeah you just check the sign of the
gradient right is that what you were

1446
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:39,280
gradient right is that what you were
 

1447
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,069
gradient right is that what you were
going to say as well yeah so basically

1448
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:42,079
going to say as well yeah so basically
 

1449
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,510
going to say as well yeah so basically
if

1450
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:45,520

 

1451
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:54,950

so I can just say that delta theta

1452
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:54,960

 

1453
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,710

Say that delta theta J

1454
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:58,720
Say that delta theta J
 

1455
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,270
Say that delta theta J
is equal to plus ADA if

1456
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,280
is equal to plus ADA if
 

1457
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,630
is equal to plus ADA if
gradient of Fbatch

1458
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:06,640
gradient of Fbatch
 

1459
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,150
gradient of Fbatch
is less than zero and is equal to minus

1460
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,160
is less than zero and is equal to minus
 

1461
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,710
is less than zero and is equal to minus
ADA if gradient

1462
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:16,720

 

1463
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,069

is greater than zero. Okay. And so that

1464
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:20,079
is greater than zero. Okay. And so that
 

1465
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,510
is greater than zero. Okay. And so that
gives me that my delta theta star

1466
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:25,520
gives me that my delta theta star
 

1467
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,470
gives me that my delta theta star
is just given by minus ADA times the

1468
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:28,480
is just given by minus ADA times the
 

1469
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,030
is just given by minus ADA times the
sign

1470
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,040
sign
 

1471
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:39,829
sign
of the gradient.

1472
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839

 

1473
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,990

But what is this exact algorithm that we

1474
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,000
But what is this exact algorithm that we
 

1475
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,150
But what is this exact algorithm that we
just talked about? Right? This is just

1476
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
just talked about? Right? This is just
 

1477
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,309
just talked about? Right? This is just
sin SGD. This is exactly the same

1478
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:48,319
sin SGD. This is exactly the same
 

1479
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,630
sin SGD. This is exactly the same
algorithm that is kind of the underlying

1480
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:50,640
algorithm that is kind of the underlying
 

1481
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,309
algorithm that is kind of the underlying
basis for atom. What we did with Adam

1482
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:52,319
basis for atom. What we did with Adam
 

1483
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,550
basis for atom. What we did with Adam
was we did a smoothing of this by adding

1484
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:54,560
was we did a smoothing of this by adding
 

1485
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,309
was we did a smoothing of this by adding
an accumulation for the gradient terms.

1486
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:58,319
an accumulation for the gradient terms.
 

1487
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,069
an accumulation for the gradient terms.
Okay.

1488
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:00,079
Okay.
 

1489
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,390
Okay.
So what this is saying is that

1490
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:04,400
So what this is saying is that
 

1491
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,950
So what this is saying is that
we can think of Adam as

1492
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:08,960
we can think of Adam as
 

1493
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,750
we can think of Adam as
from this linear perspective

1494
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
from this linear perspective
 

1495
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,550
from this linear perspective
as doing a particular descent step under

1496
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:16,560
as doing a particular descent step under
 

1497
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,069
as doing a particular descent step under
the constraint that you want to be

1498
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:20,079
the constraint that you want to be
 

1499
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,230
the constraint that you want to be
constrained in your infinity norm sense.

1500
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:24,240
constrained in your infinity norm sense.
 

1501
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,589
constrained in your infinity norm sense.
Okay.

1502
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:27,599

 

1503
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,069

So it's it's it's basically a motivation

1504
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:30,079
So it's it's it's basically a motivation
 

1505
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,750
So it's it's it's basically a motivation
a theoretical motivation uh for why sin

1506
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:33,760
a theoretical motivation uh for why sin
 

1507
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,870
a theoretical motivation uh for why sin
SGD makes sense like you can see now how

1508
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:36,880
SGD makes sense like you can see now how
 

1509
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,270
SGD makes sense like you can see now how
from the infinity norm perspective the

1510
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:39,280
from the infinity norm perspective the
 

1511
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,589
from the infinity norm perspective the
sign is actually the optimal step that

1512
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:41,599
sign is actually the optimal step that
 

1513
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,750
sign is actually the optimal step that
you can take without while making sure

1514
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:43,760
you can take without while making sure
 

1515
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,790
you can take without while making sure
that your step isn't too big right and

1516
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:46,800
that your step isn't too big right and
 

1517
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,950
that your step isn't too big right and
ADA is essentially playing the same role

1518
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:48,960
ADA is essentially playing the same role
 

1519
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,470
ADA is essentially playing the same role
as the learning rate there's a reason we

1520
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:50,480
as the learning rate there's a reason we
 

1521
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,589
as the learning rate there's a reason we
chose that bound ADA to get that exactly

1522
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:53,599
chose that bound ADA to get that exactly
 

1523
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,589
chose that bound ADA to get that exactly
same thing out

1524
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:55,599
same thing out
 

1525
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,710
same thing out
okay does that make sense for everyone?

1526
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
okay does that make sense for everyone?
 

1527
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,190
okay does that make sense for everyone?
Any questions about this?

1528
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,200
Any questions about this?
 

1529
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,309
Any questions about this?
So, we're going to be building on this

1530
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:04,319
So, we're going to be building on this
 

1531
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,470
So, we're going to be building on this
in the coming lectures when we talk

1532
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480
in the coming lectures when we talk
 

1533
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,829
in the coming lectures when we talk
about uh another series of or more in

1534
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:09,839
about uh another series of or more in
 

1535
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,550
about uh another series of or more in
this family of optimization algorithms.

1536
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:12,560
this family of optimization algorithms.
 

1537
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,190
this family of optimization algorithms.
>> Yes.

1538
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:13,200
>> Yes.
 

1539
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:22,550
>> Yes.
>> Um does that mean like function better?

1540
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,560

 

1541
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,870

No, it's not about the quality of the

1542
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:24,880
No, it's not about the quality of the
 

1543
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,589
No, it's not about the quality of the
approximation so much, but what there

1544
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:27,599
approximation so much, but what there
 

1545
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,069
approximation so much, but what there
are several recent papers talking about

1546
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:30,079
are several recent papers talking about
 

1547
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,670
are several recent papers talking about
and that's what we're trying to distill

1548
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:31,680
and that's what we're trying to distill
 

1549
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,910
and that's what we're trying to distill
and and share to you is the idea that

1550
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:35,920
and and share to you is the idea that
 

1551
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,950
and and share to you is the idea that
the particular geometries of the network

1552
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:40,960
the particular geometries of the network
 

1553
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,710
the particular geometries of the network
seem to matter. And there is there are

1554
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:44,720
seem to matter. And there is there are
 

1555
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,030
seem to matter. And there is there are
recent papers that argue that the

1556
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:47,040
recent papers that argue that the
 

1557
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,109
recent papers that argue that the
infinity norm is you can think of the

1558
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:51,119
infinity norm is you can think of the
 

1559
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,309
infinity norm is you can think of the
infinity norm as a particular um

1560
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
infinity norm as a particular um
 

1561
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,470
infinity norm as a particular um
particular kind of max norm. I think

1562
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:56,480
particular kind of max norm. I think
 

1563
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,270
particular kind of max norm. I think
that this paper um calls it the max of

1564
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,280
that this paper um calls it the max of
 

1565
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,470
that this paper um calls it the max of
max norms and this is particularly

1566
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:02,480
max norms and this is particularly
 

1567
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,829
max norms and this is particularly
aligned to uh to descent.

1568
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:07,839
aligned to uh to descent.
 

1569
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,589
aligned to uh to descent.
So what the thing is is that different

1570
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:09,599
So what the thing is is that different
 

1571
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,670
So what the thing is is that different
norms might be aligned to different

1572
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:11,680
norms might be aligned to different
 

1573
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,470
norms might be aligned to different
geometries and maybe the heart of the

1574
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:14,480
geometries and maybe the heart of the
 

1575
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,790
geometries and maybe the heart of the
problem comes from trying to find the

1576
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:16,800
problem comes from trying to find the
 

1577
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,349
problem comes from trying to find the
norm that is aligned. Now in some sense

1578
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:19,359
norm that is aligned. Now in some sense
 

1579
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,990
norm that is aligned. Now in some sense
why the infinity norm is aligned is

1580
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,000
why the infinity norm is aligned is
 

1581
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,349
why the infinity norm is aligned is
still not fully clear but maybe that

1582
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:25,359
still not fully clear but maybe that
 

1583
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,550
still not fully clear but maybe that
that is one perspective that

1584
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560
that is one perspective that
 

1585
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,150
that is one perspective that
that is the reason that Adam is

1586
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,160
that is the reason that Adam is
 

1587
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,990
that is the reason that Adam is
performing well. It's not because these

1588
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,000
performing well. It's not because these
 

1589
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,670
performing well. It's not because these
linear approximations are particularly

1590
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
linear approximations are particularly
 

1591
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,550
linear approximations are particularly
good.

1592
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:36,560
good.
 

1593
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,630
good.
Okay. So, in the interest of time, I'm

1594
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:40,640
Okay. So, in the interest of time, I'm
 

1595
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,630
Okay. So, in the interest of time, I'm
not going to do this other

1596
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:44,640
not going to do this other
 

1597
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,829
not going to do this other
uh example. If we have time, I might

1598
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:47,839
uh example. If we have time, I might
 

1599
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,990
uh example. If we have time, I might
come back to it at the end of lecture,

1600
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,000
come back to it at the end of lecture,
 

1601
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,910
come back to it at the end of lecture,
but we will either put it on discussion

1602
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:51,920
but we will either put it on discussion
 

1603
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,230
but we will either put it on discussion
or in your homework. But there's now a

1604
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,240
or in your homework. But there's now a
 

1605
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,510
or in your homework. But there's now a
natural question that you should be

1606
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:55,520
natural question that you should be
 

1607
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,829
natural question that you should be
asking me. I just did this. What is the

1608
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:57,839
asking me. I just did this. What is the
 

1609
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,750
asking me. I just did this. What is the
natural question that you all have?

1610
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,760

 

1611
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,710

We picked the infinity norm somehow but

1612
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:06,720
We picked the infinity norm somehow but
 

1613
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,829
We picked the infinity norm somehow but
that was somewhat arbitrary, right? And

1614
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:09,839
that was somewhat arbitrary, right? And
 

1615
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,230
that was somewhat arbitrary, right? And
there's many many many other norms. So

1616
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,240
there's many many many other norms. So
 

1617
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,910
there's many many many other norms. So
what's the natural other norm that you

1618
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:13,920
what's the natural other norm that you
 

1619
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,270
what's the natural other norm that you
want to take? Right? You want to try the

1620
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:15,280
want to take? Right? You want to try the
 

1621
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,829
want to take? Right? You want to try the
two norm. So what happens if you do that

1622
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
two norm. So what happens if you do that
 

1623
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,910
two norm. So what happens if you do that
exact same optimization problem but you

1624
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:21,920
exact same optimization problem but you
 

1625
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:30,790
exact same optimization problem but you
think about the two norm constraint.

1626
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:30,800

 

1627
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:44,790

Well, I want to think about delta theta.

1628
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:44,800

 

1629
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,589

Okay, I'm not going to do this right

1630
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:47,599
Okay, I'm not going to do this right
 

1631
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,150
Okay, I'm not going to do this right
now. Um, if I have time at the end of

1632
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,160
now. Um, if I have time at the end of
 

1633
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,069
now. Um, if I have time at the end of
the lecture, I'll come back to it. But

1634
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:52,079
the lecture, I'll come back to it. But
 

1635
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,230
the lecture, I'll come back to it. But
basically, you can follow a very similar

1636
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:54,240
basically, you can follow a very similar
 

1637
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,870
basically, you can follow a very similar
argument. And if you recall from 127

1638
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:58,880
argument. And if you recall from 127
 

1639
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,109
argument. And if you recall from 127
where we talked a lot about, you know,

1640
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
where we talked a lot about, you know,
 

1641
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,870
where we talked a lot about, you know,
optimization problems over different

1642
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:02,880
optimization problems over different
 

1643
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,069
optimization problems over different
kinds of norm balls, you might see that

1644
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:06,079
kinds of norm balls, you might see that
 

1645
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,230
kinds of norm balls, you might see that
there's a very there's a parallel to

1646
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:08,240
there's a very there's a parallel to
 

1647
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,670
there's a very there's a parallel to
exactly what we did, right? We're saying

1648
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:09,680
exactly what we did, right? We're saying
 

1649
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,150
exactly what we did, right? We're saying
that let's look at the infinity norm

1650
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,160
that let's look at the infinity norm
 

1651
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,630
that let's look at the infinity norm
ball and then let's maximize an inner

1652
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:14,640
ball and then let's maximize an inner
 

1653
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,470
ball and then let's maximize an inner
product within the infinity norm ball.

1654
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:16,480
product within the infinity norm ball.
 

1655
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,910
product within the infinity norm ball.
That's exactly the calculation that we

1656
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:17,920
That's exactly the calculation that we
 

1657
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,790
That's exactly the calculation that we
did. Similarly, now when you look at the

1658
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:20,800
did. Similarly, now when you look at the
 

1659
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,670
did. Similarly, now when you look at the
two norm, you're maximizing an inner

1660
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
two norm, you're maximizing an inner
 

1661
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,470
two norm, you're maximizing an inner
product within the two norm ball.

1662
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:26,480
product within the two norm ball.
 

1663
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,150
product within the two norm ball.
There's a particular inequality that's

1664
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,160
There's a particular inequality that's
 

1665

There's a particular inequality that's

matters here, which what is the
 

1667
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,990
matters here, which what is the
inequality that relates to the two norm?

1668
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:36,000

 

1669
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,990

It's the one that you learned in 16A.

It's the one that you learned in 16A.

It's the one that you learned in 16A.
It's like the only one that's the most

It's like the only one that's the most
 

1673
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,990
It's like the only one that's the most
basic one.

1674
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,000

 

1675
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,550

>> Koshi Schwarz, right? Koshi Schwarz. So

Kashwarge tells you that the inner

1678
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:48,800
Kashwarge tells you that the inner
 

1679
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,430
Kashwarge tells you that the inner
product of two vectors is the largest

1680
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,440
product of two vectors is the largest
 

1681
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,230
product of two vectors is the largest
when they are

1683
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,230

aligned. Right? So you can think about

1684
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:00,240
aligned. Right? So you can think about
 

1685
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,150
aligned. Right? So you can think about
that to think about what this might get

00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:02,160
that to think about what this might get

to do all this stuff. We're trying to
 

1753
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,230
to do all this stuff. We're trying to
optimize. We're trying to find the best

optimize. We're trying to find the best

optimization algorithms to get to the

minimum as fast as possible. But there's
 

1759
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,790
minimum as fast as possible. But there's
many, many other things that go into

many, many other things that go into
 

1761
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,750
many, many other things that go into
training our models well. And it's not

1763
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,510

just if you choose the right optimizer,

1764
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:35,520
just if you choose the right optimizer,
 

1765
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,190
just if you choose the right optimizer,
your your stuff is going to work.

1766
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:37,200
your your stuff is going to work.
 

1767
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,950
your your stuff is going to work.
There's like 500 other things that you

1768
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:38,960
There's like 500 other things that you
 

1769
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,549
There's like 500 other things that you
have to think about. And what we're

1770
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
have to think about. And what we're
 

1771
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:41,910
have to think about. And what we're
going to talk about is some of those

1772
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:41,920
going to talk about is some of those
 

1773
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,230
going to talk about is some of those
other things because turns out that

1774
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:44,240
other things because turns out that
 

1775
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,470
other things because turns out that
these all of these things all interact

1776
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
these all of these things all interact
 

1777
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,950
these all of these things all interact
to be able to understand how to optimize

1778
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:48,960
to be able to understand how to optimize
 

1779
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,230
to be able to understand how to optimize
over a network well you have to

1780
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:50,240
over a network well you have to
 

1781
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,030
over a network well you have to
understand all of the different

1782
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
understand all of the different
 

1783
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,549
understand all of the different
components.

1784
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
components.
 

1785
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,549
components.
So the other important thing or one

1786
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:54,559
So the other important thing or one
 

1787
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,950
So the other important thing or one
other important thing is standardization

1788
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:56,960
other important thing is standardization
 

1789
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,430
other important thing is standardization
and normalization of your data. And

1790
00:49:59,430 --> 00:49:59,440
and normalization of your data. And
 

1791
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,109
and normalization of your data. And
you've all seen this before in your

1792
00:50:01,109 --> 00:50:01,119
you've all seen this before in your
 

1793
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,829
you've all seen this before in your
machine learning class where whenever

1794
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:03,839
machine learning class where whenever
 

1795
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,030
machine learning class where whenever
you have some data for whatever machine

1796
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,040
you have some data for whatever machine
 

1797
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,510
you have some data for whatever machine
learning problem, you standardize it.

1798
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:09,520
learning problem, you standardize it.
 

1799
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,069
learning problem, you standardize it.
You normalize it. So what's one standard

1800
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:12,079
You normalize it. So what's one standard
 

1801
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,150
You normalize it. So what's one standard
way of normalizing things? Well, you

1802
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:14,160
way of normalizing things? Well, you
 

1803
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,030
way of normalizing things? Well, you
say, let me take my all of my data and

1804
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:17,040
say, let me take my all of my data and
 

1805
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,069
say, let me take my all of my data and
squish it to be within minus one to one

1806
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
squish it to be within minus one to one
 

1807
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,230
squish it to be within minus one to one
or let me make it zero mean with

1808
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:22,240
or let me make it zero mean with
 

1809
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,150
or let me make it zero mean with
variance one. Right? These are standard

1810
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:24,160
variance one. Right? These are standard
 

1811
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,670
variance one. Right? These are standard
things, standard tricks and standard

1812
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:25,680
things, standard tricks and standard
 

1813
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,910
things, standard tricks and standard
transformations and scalings that you do

1814
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:27,920
transformations and scalings that you do
 

1815
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,030
transformations and scalings that you do
of your data to to get into that range.

1816
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:31,040
of your data to to get into that range.
 

1817
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,950
of your data to to get into that range.
Why do we care about doing this? And why

1818
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:32,960
Why do we care about doing this? And why
 

1819
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,790
Why do we care about doing this? And why
do we standardize the data in this way?

1820
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:36,800
do we standardize the data in this way?
 

1821
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,790
do we standardize the data in this way?
Anyone remember

1822
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:38,800
Anyone remember
 

1823
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,990
Anyone remember
what is the who cares? Why like why what

1824
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:42,000
what is the who cares? Why like why what
 

1825
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,750
what is the who cares? Why like why what
happens? What's the bad thing that can

1826
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:43,760
happens? What's the bad thing that can
 

1827
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,349
happens? What's the bad thing that can
happen if you have some features that

1828
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:47,359
happen if you have some features that
 

1829
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,430
happen if you have some features that
are, you know, on the order of 10 the

00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:49,440
are, you know, on the order of 10 the

1843
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,190
>> You're going to have numerical stability
problems, right? First, if your dynamic

1844
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:03,200
problems, right? First, if your dynamic
 

1845
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,589
problems, right? First, if your dynamic
range is too big, you simply might not

1846
00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:05,599
range is too big, you simply might not
 

1847
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,190
range is too big, you simply might not
be able to fit it into floatingoint

1848
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,200
be able to fit it into floatingoint
 

1849
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,430
be able to fit it into floatingoint
precision. So, that's that's a clear

1850
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,440
precision. So, that's that's a clear
 

1851
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,630
precision. So, that's that's a clear
that's a uh that's a key issue.

1852
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:12,640
that's a uh that's a key issue.
 

1853
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,109
that's a uh that's a key issue.
Um but second you might have really bad

1854
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:15,119
Um but second you might have really bad
 

1855
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,109
Um but second you might have really bad
conditioning on your matrices right so

1856
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:17,119
conditioning on your matrices right so
 

1857
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,069
conditioning on your matrices right so
you might have problems inverting things

1858
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:20,079
you might have problems inverting things
 

1859
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,790
you might have problems inverting things
but there's another even in some sense

1860
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
but there's another even in some sense
 

1861
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,190
but there's another even in some sense
uh more fundamental issue which is that

1862
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
uh more fundamental issue which is that
 

1863
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,630
uh more fundamental issue which is that
like let's say I have different features

1864
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:28,640
like let's say I have different features
 

1865
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,069
like let's say I have different features
I'm trying to predict um I don't know a

1866
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:32,079
I'm trying to predict um I don't know a
 

1867
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,549
I'm trying to predict um I don't know a
person's favorite flavor of ice cream

1868
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:34,559
person's favorite flavor of ice cream
 

1869
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,349
person's favorite flavor of ice cream
and I have different features that are

1870
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:37,359
and I have different features that are
 

1871
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,150
and I have different features that are
you know the person's height and the

1872
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:40,160
you know the person's height and the
 

1873
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,069
you know the person's height and the
person's birth eight and the person's

1874
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:44,079
person's birth eight and the person's
 

1875
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,270
person's birth eight and the person's
um I don't know favorite part of 182 um

1876
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:49,280
um I don't know favorite part of 182 um
 

1877
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,109
um I don't know favorite part of 182 um
whatever these features are these are

1878
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:51,119
whatever these features are these are
 

1879
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,630
whatever these features are these are
all very different types of features

1880
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:52,640
all very different types of features
 

1881
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,150
all very different types of features
right and so if I have some features

1882
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
right and so if I have some features
 

1883
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,230
right and so if I have some features
that are really small and other features

1884
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
that are really small and other features
 

1885
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,270
that are really small and other features
that are really large the large features

1886
00:51:59,270 --> 00:51:59,280
that are really large the large features
 

1887
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,829
that are really large the large features
are going to dominate

1888
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:01,839
are going to dominate
 

1889
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,150
are going to dominate
in whatever my model ends up predicting

1890
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,160
in whatever my model ends up predicting
 

1891
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,589
in whatever my model ends up predicting
right if I have some some things that

1892
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:05,599
right if I have some some things that
 

1893
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,829
right if I have some some things that
are tiny they're just not they're just

1894
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:07,839
are tiny they're just not they're just
 

1895
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,030
are tiny they're just not they're just
going to be ignored in my error

1896
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:09,040
going to be ignored in my error
 

1897
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,630
going to be ignored in my error
computation and these big things are

1898
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:10,640
computation and these big things are
 

1899
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,030
computation and these big things are
going uh going to matter more even

1900
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:13,040
going uh going to matter more even
 

1901
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,309
going uh going to matter more even
though they might not actually be the

1902
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:16,319
though they might not actually be the
 

1903
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,790
though they might not actually be the
most uh informative features. So by

1904
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:20,800
most uh informative features. So by
 

1905
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,109
most uh informative features. So by
normalizing all of the features, what I

1906
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:23,119
normalizing all of the features, what I
 

1907
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,069
normalizing all of the features, what I
can do is I can have all of the features

1908
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:26,079
can do is I can have all of the features
 

1909
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,589
can do is I can have all of the features
have an equal chance of having high

1910
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:27,599
have an equal chance of having high
 

1911
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,829
have an equal chance of having high
predictive power. So one way to think

1912
00:52:29,829 --> 00:52:29,839
predictive power. So one way to think
 

1913
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,670
predictive power. So one way to think
about is if you think about SVMs, right?

1914
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:31,680
about is if you think about SVMs, right?
 

1915
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,109
about is if you think about SVMs, right?
So you think about max margin

1916
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
So you think about max margin
 

1917
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,510
So you think about max margin
separators. Max margin separators are

1918
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:35,520
separators. Max margin separators are
 

1919
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,030
separators. Max margin separators are
saying like let let me make sure that

1920
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:37,040
saying like let let me make sure that
 

1921
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,470
saying like let let me make sure that
the actual distance is is maximized

1922
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:40,480
the actual distance is is maximized
 

1923
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,069
the actual distance is is maximized
right between my two classes right and

1924
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:44,079
right between my two classes right and
 

1925
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,349
right between my two classes right and
now if I have if I have a vector where

1926
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:47,359
now if I have if I have a vector where
 

1927
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,190
now if I have if I have a vector where
um some components maybe the first few

1928
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,200
um some components maybe the first few
 

1929
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,870
um some components maybe the first few
components are always really small and

1930
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:50,880
components are always really small and
 

1931
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,470
components are always really small and
the last few components are always

1932
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:52,480
the last few components are always
 

1933
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,870
the last few components are always
really large my distance maximization is

1934
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:54,880
really large my distance maximization is
 

1935
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,870
really large my distance maximization is
going to matter is going to depend more

1936
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:56,880
going to matter is going to depend more
 

1937
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,829
going to matter is going to depend more
on these last few components than on the

1938
00:52:59,829 --> 00:52:59,839
on these last few components than on the
 

1939
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,190
on these last few components than on the
first few components does everyone see

1940
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,200
first few components does everyone see
 

1941
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,549
first few components does everyone see
that and so I will have a different

1942
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:04,559
that and so I will have a different
 

1943
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,750
that and so I will have a different
perspective than if I had everything

1944
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:07,760
perspective than if I had everything
 

1945
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,510
perspective than if I had everything
that was approximately in the same order

1946
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:09,520
that was approximately in the same order
 

1947
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,190
that was approximately in the same order
of magnitude.

1948
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:11,200
of magnitude.
 

1949
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,870
of magnitude.
So my outcomes will actually be

1950
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:12,880
So my outcomes will actually be
 

1951
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,549
So my outcomes will actually be
different if I do and do not normalize

1952
00:53:14,549 --> 00:53:14,559
different if I do and do not normalize
 

1953
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,790
different if I do and do not normalize
my data.

1954
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:16,800
my data.
 

1955
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,950
my data.
Everyone understand that? So you're

1956
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:18,960
Everyone understand that? So you're
 

1957
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,549
Everyone understand that? So you're
bought in on the fact that we need to

1958
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:20,559
bought in on the fact that we need to
 

1959
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:21,990
bought in on the fact that we need to
normalize our data and we need to

1960
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,000
normalize our data and we need to
 

1961
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,790
normalize our data and we need to
standardize things. Okay.

1962
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:24,800
standardize things. Okay.
 

1963
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,549
standardize things. Okay.
From a neural network perspective,

1964
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:26,559
From a neural network perspective,
 

1965
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,109
From a neural network perspective,
there's one more important thing is that

1966
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:29,119
there's one more important thing is that
 

1967
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,270
there's one more important thing is that
neural networks have nonlinearities. The

1968
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
neural networks have nonlinearities. The
 

1969
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,190
neural networks have nonlinearities. The
nonlinearities are the power of the

1970
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:33,200
nonlinearities are the power of the
 

1971
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,670
nonlinearities are the power of the
neural networks. And if you think about

1972
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:35,680
neural networks. And if you think about
 

1973
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,710
neural networks. And if you think about
relus for example, well the interesting

1974
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:38,720
relus for example, well the interesting
 

1975
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,870
relus for example, well the interesting
stuff in rel is essentially somehow

1976
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:40,880
stuff in rel is essentially somehow
 

1977
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,910
stuff in rel is essentially somehow
happening around zero, right? The

1978
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:43,920
happening around zero, right? The
 

1979
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,470
happening around zero, right? The
nonlinearity of the relu is near zero or

1980
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:46,480
nonlinearity of the relu is near zero or
 

1981
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,230
nonlinearity of the relu is near zero or
whatever it is. So you want to be able

1982
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,240
whatever it is. So you want to be able
 

1983
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,630
whatever it is. So you want to be able
to make sure that your data is in is set

1984
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:50,640
to make sure that your data is in is set
 

1985
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,950
to make sure that your data is in is set
up in a way that you can actually

1986
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:52,960
up in a way that you can actually
 

1987
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,790
up in a way that you can actually
harness the power of that nonlinearity.

1988
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:54,800
harness the power of that nonlinearity.
 

1989
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,950
harness the power of that nonlinearity.
And if you're kind of way out there in

1990
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:56,960
And if you're kind of way out there in
 

1991
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,589
And if you're kind of way out there in
different places, then you might not be

1992
00:53:59,589 --> 00:53:59,599
different places, then you might not be
 

1993
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,549
different places, then you might not be
able to do that very well. Okay.

1994
00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:02,559
able to do that very well. Okay.
 

1995
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,790
able to do that very well. Okay.
So to see that, let's consider actually

1996
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:04,800
So to see that, let's consider actually
 

1997
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,510
So to see that, let's consider actually
this like a very simple ReLU case, the

1998
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:07,520
this like a very simple ReLU case, the
 

1999
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,030
this like a very simple ReLU case, the
scalar case that you've already all

2000
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,040
scalar case that you've already all
 

2001
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,230
scalar case that you've already all
looked at in your homework.

2002
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:12,240
looked at in your homework.
 

2003
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,390
looked at in your homework.
So here I have some input X and then I

2004
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:16,400
So here I have some input X and then I
 

2005
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,950
So here I have some input X and then I
multiply it by a weight. I add a bias

2006
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:18,960
multiply it by a weight. I add a bias
 

2007
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,549
multiply it by a weight. I add a bias
and then I have my ReLU nonlinearity for

2008
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:22,559
and then I have my ReLU nonlinearity for
 

2009
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,309
and then I have my ReLU nonlinearity for
this, right?

2010
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:24,319
this, right?
 

2011
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,790
this, right?
And my relu nonlinearity looks basically

2012
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:26,800
And my relu nonlinearity looks basically
 

2013
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,829
And my relu nonlinearity looks basically
like this elbow. And where is this

2014
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:29,839
like this elbow. And where is this
 

2015
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,430
like this elbow. And where is this
elbow? Well, it's going to be at minus b

2016
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:31,440
elbow? Well, it's going to be at minus b
 

2017
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,670
elbow? Well, it's going to be at minus b
over w. Right? So by choosing the weight

2018
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:33,680
over w. Right? So by choosing the weight
 

2019
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,109
over w. Right? So by choosing the weight
and the bias, I get to move where this

2020
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:35,119
and the bias, I get to move where this
 

2021
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,829
and the bias, I get to move where this
elbow actually ends up. So we're going

2022
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:37,839
elbow actually ends up. So we're going
 

2023
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:41,109
elbow actually ends up. So we're going
to train this network. But let's say we

2024
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:41,119
to train this network. But let's say we
 

2025
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,790
to train this network. But let's say we
initialize this network at um with you

2026
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:44,800
initialize this network at um with you
 

2027
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,430
initialize this network at um with you
know normal 01 parameters. So I have B

2028
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:47,440
know normal 01 parameters. So I have B
 

2029
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,990
know normal 01 parameters. So I have B
is normal 01 and my W is also normal 01.

2030
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,000
is normal 01 and my W is also normal 01.
 

2031
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,829
is normal 01 and my W is also normal 01.
Then it turns out that I can think of um

2032
00:54:59,829 --> 00:54:59,839
Then it turns out that I can think of um
 

2033
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,109
Then it turns out that I can think of um
my uh corner my elbow

2034
00:55:05,109 --> 00:55:05,119
my uh corner my elbow
 

2035
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,870
my uh corner my elbow
as coming from a Kashi distribution

2036
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:06,880
as coming from a Kashi distribution
 

2037
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,309
as coming from a Kashi distribution
because that's going to be the

2038
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:08,319
because that's going to be the
 

2039
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,069
because that's going to be the
distribution that comes from this ratio

2040
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:10,079
distribution that comes from this ratio
 

2041
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,109
distribution that comes from this ratio
of two Gaussian distributions. Okay. So

2042
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:13,119
of two Gaussian distributions. Okay. So
 

2043
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,870
of two Gaussian distributions. Okay. So
this Kashi distribution has the

2044
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:14,880
this Kashi distribution has the
 

2045
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,710
this Kashi distribution has the
following um density 1 over pi.

2046
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,720
following um density 1 over pi.
 

2047
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,950
following um density 1 over pi.
Basically it's like 1 /x^2

2048
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:22,960

 

2049
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,230

And this distribution has some

2050
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
And this distribution has some
 

2051
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,030
And this distribution has some
interesting properties, right? A lot of

2052
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,040
interesting properties, right? A lot of
 

2053
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,829
interesting properties, right? A lot of
the mass of this distribution is around

2054
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:29,839
the mass of this distribution is around
 

2055
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,549
the mass of this distribution is around
zero. But the mean of it is actually

2056
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:32,559
zero. But the mean of it is actually
 

2057
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,230
zero. But the mean of it is actually
undefined because this is actually it

2058
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:34,240
undefined because this is actually it
 

2059
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,430
undefined because this is actually it
ends up being a divergent series.

2060
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
ends up being a divergent series.
 

2061
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,510
ends up being a divergent series.
The variance of this thing is infinite

2062
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:39,520
The variance of this thing is infinite
 

2063
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,950
The variance of this thing is infinite
because these things are heavy tailed.

2064
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:40,960
because these things are heavy tailed.
 

2065
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,990
because these things are heavy tailed.
So you can kind of have mass that the

2066
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:44,000
So you can kind of have mass that the
 

2067
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,990
So you can kind of have mass that the
mass is going out to infinity and you

2068
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,000
mass is going out to infinity and you
 

2069
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,230
mass is going out to infinity and you
have a lot of mass going there.

2070
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:48,240
have a lot of mass going there.
 

2071
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,109
have a lot of mass going there.
Nonetheless, if I try to look at where

2072
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:51,119
Nonetheless, if I try to look at where
 

2073
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,870
Nonetheless, if I try to look at where
the probability mass of this is, if I

2074
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:52,880
the probability mass of this is, if I
 

2075
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,510
the probability mass of this is, if I
look at the CDFs of these things, well,

2076
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
look at the CDFs of these things, well,
 

2077
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,510
look at the CDFs of these things, well,
I can say that 50% of the probability

2078
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:57,520
I can say that 50% of the probability
 

2079
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,630
I can say that 50% of the probability
mass is actually between minus1 to 1.

2080
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:00,640
mass is actually between minus1 to 1.
 

2081
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,750
mass is actually between minus1 to 1.
And if I keep looking, you know, 90% of

2082
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:03,760
And if I keep looking, you know, 90% of
 

2083
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,270
And if I keep looking, you know, 90% of
it is between minus 7 to 7, right? 70%

2084
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280
it is between minus 7 to 7, right? 70%
 

2085
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,109
it is between minus 7 to 7, right? 70%
between -2 to 2, 80% between -3 to 3,

2086
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:11,119
between -2 to 2, 80% between -3 to 3,
 

2087
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,789
between -2 to 2, 80% between -3 to 3,
and then most of it is actually from

2088
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:12,799
and then most of it is actually from
 

2089
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,670
and then most of it is actually from
minus 7 to 7. So what does this mean?

2090
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:15,680
minus 7 to 7. So what does this mean?
 

2091
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,309
minus 7 to 7. So what does this mean?
This means that these corners, where do

2092
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:18,319
This means that these corners, where do
 

2093
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:23,190
This means that these corners, where do
they hang out under this initialization?

2094
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:23,200
they hang out under this initialization?
 

2095
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,670
they hang out under this initialization?
Under this initialization, yes, there

2096
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:25,680
Under this initialization, yes, there
 

2097
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,630
Under this initialization, yes, there
some that are way out there, but most of

2098
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:28,640
some that are way out there, but most of
 

2099
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,670
some that are way out there, but most of
them are still kind of around zero.

2100
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
them are still kind of around zero.
 

2101
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,589
them are still kind of around zero.
Okay, everyone see that?

2102
00:56:35,589 --> 00:56:35,599
Okay, everyone see that?
 

2103
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:39,270
Okay, everyone see that?
Okay, good.

2104
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:39,280

 

2105
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,470

So now what we want to do is we want to

2106
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:42,480
So now what we want to do is we want to
 

2107
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,510
So now what we want to do is we want to
get our data to be in a spot basically

2108
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:47,520
get our data to be in a spot basically
 

2109
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,150
get our data to be in a spot basically
where the nonlinearity is actually

2110
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:50,160
where the nonlinearity is actually
 

2111
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,670
where the nonlinearity is actually
interesting

2112
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:51,680
interesting
 

2113
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,990
interesting
and here we talked about the relu but

2114
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,000
and here we talked about the relu but
 

2115
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,470
and here we talked about the relu but
even if I was to take let's say some

2116
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
even if I was to take let's say some
 

2117
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,390
even if I was to take let's say some
other nonlinearity the interesting stuff

2118
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:58,400
other nonlinearity the interesting stuff
 

2119
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,109
other nonlinearity the interesting stuff
is still kind of going to be happening

2120
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:01,119
is still kind of going to be happening
 

2121
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,270
is still kind of going to be happening
around zeroish.

2122
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:03,280
around zeroish.
 

2123
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,349
around zeroish.
So what we want to do is we want to be

2124
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,359
So what we want to do is we want to be
 

2125
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,109
So what we want to do is we want to be
able to initialize we want to be able to

2126
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:07,119
able to initialize we want to be able to
 

2127
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,950
able to initialize we want to be able to
standardize our data so that it can be

2128
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:10,960
standardize our data so that it can be
 

2129
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,870
standardize our data so that it can be
also around zero and that's why one

2130
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:12,880
also around zero and that's why one
 

2131
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,390
also around zero and that's why one
thing that you often do is that you will

2132
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:14,400
thing that you often do is that you will
 

2133
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,750
thing that you often do is that you will
take your data and you will normalize it

2134
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:15,760
take your data and you will normalize it
 

2135
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,910
take your data and you will normalize it
to be zero mean or or standardize it to

2136
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:17,920
to be zero mean or or standardize it to
 

2137
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,230
to be zero mean or or standardize it to
be zero mean and variance one or just

2138
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:20,240
be zero mean and variance one or just
 

2139
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,710
be zero mean and variance one or just
uniform between minus1 to one. Okay.

2140
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:24,720
uniform between minus1 to one. Okay.
 

2141
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,750
uniform between minus1 to one. Okay.
So then what happens basically if we you

2142
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:27,760
So then what happens basically if we you
 

2143
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,990
So then what happens basically if we you
know don't do this

2144
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,000

 

2145
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,710

let's take an example let's consider and

2146
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:34,720
let's take an example let's consider and
 

2147
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,349
let's take an example let's consider and
suppose all of our input data came from

2148
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
suppose all of our input data came from
 

2149
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:42,230
suppose all of our input data came from
this range of 100 to 200.

2150
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:42,240
this range of 100 to 200.
 

2151
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,630
this range of 100 to 200.
Well, you can compute exactly using the

2152
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:44,640
Well, you can compute exactly using the
 

2153
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,870
Well, you can compute exactly using the
Koshi distribution. The approximate

2154
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:46,880
Koshi distribution. The approximate
 

2155
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,270
Koshi distribution. The approximate
probability of one of your elbows

2156
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,280
probability of one of your elbows
 

2157
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,470
probability of one of your elbows
landing in this range is about 0.1%.

2158
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,480
landing in this range is about 0.1%.
 

2159
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,309
landing in this range is about 0.1%.
Right? Really small. So, you're going to

2160
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:56,319
Right? Really small. So, you're going to
 

2161
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,910
Right? Really small. So, you're going to
have maybe two, three corners that are

2162
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920
have maybe two, three corners that are
 

2163
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,630
have maybe two, three corners that are
actually going to hit your data. So,

2164
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:02,640
actually going to hit your data. So,
 

2165
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,789
actually going to hit your data. So,
what does that mean? Most of your data

2166
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:04,799
what does that mean? Most of your data
 

2167
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,270
what does that mean? Most of your data
is going to either see just zero or it's

2168
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:09,280
is going to either see just zero or it's
 

2169
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,030
is going to either see just zero or it's
going to see the straight uh aphine

2170
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:13,040
going to see the straight uh aphine
 

2171
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,510
going to see the straight uh aphine
function, right? It's not going to see

2172
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:15,520
function, right? It's not going to see
 

2173
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,190
function, right? It's not going to see
anything

2174
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:17,200
anything
 

2175
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,470
anything
interesting. You're going to have a lot

2176
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:18,480
interesting. You're going to have a lot
 

2177
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,549
interesting. You're going to have a lot
of limitations in kind of the

2178
00:58:20,549 --> 00:58:20,559
of limitations in kind of the
 

2179
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,750
of limitations in kind of the
expressivity that you can uh you can

2180
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:23,760
expressivity that you can uh you can
 

2181
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,549
expressivity that you can uh you can
get. Does everyone see this intuition?

2182
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:26,559
get. Does everyone see this intuition?
 

2183
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,710
get. Does everyone see this intuition?
Yeah. And do you see that that could be

2184
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:28,720
Yeah. And do you see that that could be
 

2185
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,349
Yeah. And do you see that that could be
bad? So if I want to think about it

2186
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:31,359
bad? So if I want to think about it
 

2187
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:33,430
bad? So if I want to think about it
mathematically, mathematically why is

2188
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
mathematically, mathematically why is
 

2189
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:46,630
mathematically, mathematically why is
this bad?

2190
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:46,640

 

2191
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:52,710

Okay.

2192
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:52,720

 

2193
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,030

So for this like for example if I take

2194
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,040
So for this like for example if I take
 

2195
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,470
So for this like for example if I take
again a simple example I have some

2196
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:58,480
again a simple example I have some
 

2197
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,510
again a simple example I have some
X um and I'm multiplying it by different

2198
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:01,520
X um and I'm multiplying it by different
 

2199
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,349
X um and I'm multiplying it by different
weights W1

2200
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:05,359
weights W1
 

2201
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:11,270
weights W1
and then I add a bias B1

2202
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280

 

2203
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,309

and then it goes into my ReLU

2204
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:16,319

 

2205
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:33,670

W2 to

2206
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:33,680

 

2207
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,549

Can I have these activations or input

2208
00:59:36,549 --> 00:59:36,559
Can I have these activations or input
 

2209
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,470
Can I have these activations or input
pre-activations that are coming out?

2210
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:40,480
pre-activations that are coming out?
 

2211
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,990
pre-activations that are coming out?
Um, let's say I have a thousand

2212
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:44,000
Um, let's say I have a thousand
 

2213
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,230
Um, let's say I have a thousand
units here.

2214
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:50,240

 

2215
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,910

So what this is doing is basically

2216
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:51,920
So what this is doing is basically
 

2217
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,910
So what this is doing is basically
computing this scaler and this is a

2218
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:53,920
computing this scaler and this is a
 

2219
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,789
computing this scaler and this is a
thousand dimensional vector of or this

2220
00:59:56,789 --> 00:59:56,799
thousand dimensional vector of or this
 

2221
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,069
thousand dimensional vector of or this
is the features that are coming out

2222
00:59:58,069 --> 00:59:58,079
is the features that are coming out
 

2223
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,470
is the features that are coming out
right from doing this.

2224
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:00,480
right from doing this.
 

2225
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,630
right from doing this.
So what happens if there are no corners?

2226
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:02,640
So what happens if there are no corners?
 

2227
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,150
So what happens if there are no corners?
What do these h1 h2 h thousand actually

2228
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:06,160
What do these h1 h2 h thousand actually
 

2229
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,510
What do these h1 h2 h thousand actually
look like? These are the features that

2230
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:07,520
look like? These are the features that
 

2231
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:13,910
look like? These are the features that
I'm trying to get to be interesting.

2232
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:13,920

 

2233
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,069

the red shirt at the back. Yeah,

2234
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:18,079
the red shirt at the back. Yeah,
 

2235
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:19,910
the red shirt at the back. Yeah,
>> the rail wouldn't do anything in some

2236
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:19,920
>> the rail wouldn't do anything in some
 

2237
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,789
>> the rail wouldn't do anything in some
sense, right? So, if I have no corners,

2238
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:24,799

 

2239
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,349

what I'm going to have is my hi is going

2240
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,359
what I'm going to have is my hi is going
 

2241
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:31,109
what I'm going to have is my hi is going
to be either is going to just be zero.

2242
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:31,119
to be either is going to just be zero.
 

2243
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:32,630
to be either is going to just be zero.
And this is going to be true for every

2244
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:32,640
And this is going to be true for every
 

2245
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,910
And this is going to be true for every
input, right?

2246
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:35,920
input, right?
 

2247
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,430
input, right?
All of my inputs are in this range. It's

2248
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:37,440
All of my inputs are in this range. It's
 

2249
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,150
All of my inputs are in this range. It's
going to be either zero or I will hit

2250
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:40,160
going to be either zero or I will hit
 

2251
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,789
going to be either zero or I will hit
some

2252
01:00:44,789 --> 01:00:44,799

 

2253
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,390

I'll hit the linear part, right?

2254
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:48,400
I'll hit the linear part, right?
 

2255
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,589
I'll hit the linear part, right?
So for some alpha and beta, I'm going to

2256
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:51,599
So for some alpha and beta, I'm going to
 

2257
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,670
So for some alpha and beta, I'm going to
be

2258
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:53,680
be
 

2259
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,750
be
but I don't have an input that like you

2260
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:55,760
but I don't have an input that like you
 

2261
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,870
but I don't have an input that like you
know will actually use the elbow part of

2262
01:00:58,870 --> 01:00:58,880
know will actually use the elbow part of
 

2263
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,670
know will actually use the elbow part of
this.

2264
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:01,680
this.
 

2265
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,750
this.
Okay.

2266
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:03,760
Okay.
 

2267
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,870
Okay.
So what does this mean for if I think

2268
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:06,880
So what does this mean for if I think
 

2269
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,549
So what does this mean for if I think
about now if I think about all of my

2270
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:08,559
about now if I think about all of my
 

2271
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,430
about now if I think about all of my
data and I think about it as a as a I

2272
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:11,440
data and I think about it as a as a I
 

2273
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,069
data and I think about it as a as a I
think about the the the matrix that is

2274
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:14,079
think about the the the matrix that is
 

2275
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,069
think about the the the matrix that is
coming from looking at the features of

2276
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:16,079
coming from looking at the features of
 

2277
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,270
coming from looking at the features of
all of my data

2278
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:19,280
all of my data
 

2279
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,549
all of my data
here. Let's say this is going into a

2280
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:20,559
here. Let's say this is going into a
 

2281
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,270
here. Let's say this is going into a
linear layer. Now what does that matrix

2282
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,280
linear layer. Now what does that matrix
 

2283
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,230
linear layer. Now what does that matrix
looks like? Well, it looks like just

2284
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:26,240
looks like? Well, it looks like just
 

2285
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,710
looks like? Well, it looks like just
either you have a column of zeros

2286
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:28,720
either you have a column of zeros
 

2287
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,670
either you have a column of zeros
because you've just hit the zeros or you

2288
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:31,680
because you've just hit the zeros or you
 

2289
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,470
because you've just hit the zeros or you
have a column that is looking entirely

2290
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:34,480
have a column that is looking entirely
 

2291
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,670
have a column that is looking entirely
like this, right?

2292
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:37,680
like this, right?
 

2293
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,950
like this, right?
So this now matrix is this matrix going

2294
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:40,960
So this now matrix is this matrix going
 

2295
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,470
So this now matrix is this matrix going
to be a full rank matrix?

2296
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:44,480
to be a full rank matrix?
 

2297
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,589
to be a full rank matrix?
Well, first you're going to have lots of

2298
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:45,599
Well, first you're going to have lots of
 

2299
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,109
Well, first you're going to have lots of
columns of zeros in it. So that's

2300
01:01:47,109 --> 01:01:47,119
columns of zeros in it. So that's
 

2301
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,030
columns of zeros in it. So that's
already you're losing a bunch of rank

2302
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:49,040
already you're losing a bunch of rank
 

2303
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,150
already you're losing a bunch of rank
and even the other columns are all going

2304
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:52,160
and even the other columns are all going
 

2305
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,630
and even the other columns are all going
to be

2306
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:54,640
to be
 

2307
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,589
to be
related to each other, right? So what

2308
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:57,599
related to each other, right? So what
 

2309
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,069
related to each other, right? So what
you're going to have is a very low rank

2310
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:00,079
you're going to have is a very low rank
 

2311
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:02,069
you're going to have is a very low rank
matrix. So for example, just to see that

2312
01:02:02,069 --> 01:02:02,079
matrix. So for example, just to see that
 

2313
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,789
matrix. So for example, just to see that
if you wanted to look at this and say

2314
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:04,799
if you wanted to look at this and say
 

2315
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,390
if you wanted to look at this and say
just hypothetically, let's say all the

2316
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
just hypothetically, let's say all the
 

2317
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,630
just hypothetically, let's say all the
beta eyes were zero.

2318
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:08,640
beta eyes were zero.
 

2319
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,630
beta eyes were zero.
Wrong pen.

2320
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:12,640

 

2321
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,430

And I have some matrix here that is like

2322
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:15,440
And I have some matrix here that is like
 

2323
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:24,710
And I have some matrix here that is like
alpha 1 x1 + beta 1 alpha 1 x2 + beta 1

2324
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:24,720

 

2325
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:33,190

alpha 1 x n + beta 1

2326
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:33,200

 

2327
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,069

Let's see. I have all the way to H100.

2328
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:36,079
Let's see. I have all the way to H100.
 

2329
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,430
Let's see. I have all the way to H100.
So, X1 plus beta 1

2330
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:39,440
So, X1 plus beta 1
 

2331
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:49,190
So, X1 plus beta 1
or beta 1000.

2332
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:49,200

 

2333
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,870

So, let's say I have some matrix like

2334
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:50,880
So, let's say I have some matrix like
 

2335
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,549
So, let's say I have some matrix like
this.

2336
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:52,559
this.
 

2337
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,510
this.
And if all the betas were zeros,

2338
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:55,520
And if all the betas were zeros,
 

2339
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:00,390
And if all the betas were zeros,
what are these columns?

2340
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:00,400

 

2341
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,230

Dude, what is the rank of this matrix if

2342
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:02,240
Dude, what is the rank of this matrix if
 

2343
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:07,270
Dude, what is the rank of this matrix if
all the betas are zero?

2344
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:07,280

 

2345
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,789

>> Yeah, someone said it. Just say it

2346
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:08,799
>> Yeah, someone said it. Just say it
 

2347
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,829
>> Yeah, someone said it. Just say it
louder.

2348
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:09,839
louder.
 

2349
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,829
louder.
>> One, right? It's just multiples of the

2350
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:11,839
>> One, right? It's just multiples of the
 

2351
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,309
>> One, right? It's just multiples of the
same column.

2352
01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:14,319
same column.
 

2353
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,150
same column.
And similarly, if all the alphas were

2354
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:16,160
And similarly, if all the alphas were
 

2355
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,069
And similarly, if all the alphas were
zero,

2356
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:18,079
zero,
 

2357
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,430
zero,
you're still going to have a rank one

2358
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:19,440
you're still going to have a rank one
 

2359
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,750
you're still going to have a rank one
matrix because now you just have beta 1,

2360
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:21,760
matrix because now you just have beta 1,
 

2361
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,270
matrix because now you just have beta 1,
beta 2, beta 3, beta 4, right? That's

2362
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:25,280
beta 2, beta 3, beta 4, right? That's
 

2363
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,029
beta 2, beta 3, beta 4, right? That's
also now just copies of the same row. So

2364
01:03:27,029 --> 01:03:27,039
also now just copies of the same row. So
 

2365
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,349
also now just copies of the same row. So
you again end up with a rank one matrix.

2366
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:29,359
you again end up with a rank one matrix.
 

2367
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:30,870
you again end up with a rank one matrix.
So then you can think of this matrix

2368
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:30,880
So then you can think of this matrix
 

2369
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,309
So then you can think of this matrix
basically as the sum of the two cases

2370
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:34,319
basically as the sum of the two cases
 

2371
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,470
basically as the sum of the two cases
when alpha is zero and beta is zero. And

2372
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:36,480
when alpha is zero and beta is zero. And
 

2373
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,150
when alpha is zero and beta is zero. And
you can say that this basically is going

2374
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:38,160
you can say that this basically is going
 

2375
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,990
you can say that this basically is going
to be a rank two matrix. Okay. But you

2376
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:42,000
to be a rank two matrix. Okay. But you
 

2377
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,829
to be a rank two matrix. Okay. But you
definitely rank two is not good enough.

2378
01:03:43,829 --> 01:03:43,839
definitely rank two is not good enough.
 

2379
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:45,510
definitely rank two is not good enough.
Right?

2380
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:45,520
Right?
 

2381
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,190
Right?
And maybe you know maybe you got like so

2382
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:47,200
And maybe you know maybe you got like so
 

2383
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,390
And maybe you know maybe you got like so
this is this is a case where you got

2384
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:48,400
this is this is a case where you got
 

2385
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,710
this is this is a case where you got
zero corners between

2386
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:50,720
zero corners between
 

2387
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,710
zero corners between
the in the data range that you have.

2388
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:52,720
the in the data range that you have.
 

2389
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,309
the in the data range that you have.
Maybe you got like one or two corners,

2390
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:54,319
Maybe you got like one or two corners,
 

2391
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,309
Maybe you got like one or two corners,
right? Maybe you got five corners, but

2392
01:03:56,309 --> 01:03:56,319
right? Maybe you got five corners, but
 

2393
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:58,470
right? Maybe you got five corners, but
that's still not going to be an

2394
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:58,480
that's still not going to be an
 

2395
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,549
that's still not going to be an
expressive enough matrix for you to be

2396
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:00,559
expressive enough matrix for you to be
 

2397
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,349
expressive enough matrix for you to be
able to actually use your data. Okay, so

2398
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:03,359
able to actually use your data. Okay, so
 

2399
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,190
able to actually use your data. Okay, so
mathematically, like intuitively, you

2400
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:05,200
mathematically, like intuitively, you
 

2401
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,470
mathematically, like intuitively, you
see why this is bad. But even

2402
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480
see why this is bad. But even
 

2403
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,990
see why this is bad. But even
mathematically, from you look at if you

2404
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:08,000
mathematically, from you look at if you
 

2405
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,950
mathematically, from you look at if you
look at the conditioning of this matrix,

2406
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:10,960
look at the conditioning of this matrix,
 

2407
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,950
look at the conditioning of this matrix,
it's still not a good situation to be in

2408
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:12,960
it's still not a good situation to be in
 

2409
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,549
it's still not a good situation to be in
to have your data be all in a range that

2410
01:04:16,549 --> 01:04:16,559
to have your data be all in a range that
 

2411
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:17,910
to have your data be all in a range that
is very different from where your

2412
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:17,920
is very different from where your
 

2413
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,589
is very different from where your
nonlinearities are hanging out. Okay,

2414
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:21,599
nonlinearities are hanging out. Okay,
 

2415
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,190
nonlinearities are hanging out. Okay,
that's basically the main point that I

2416
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:23,200
that's basically the main point that I
 

2417
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,549
that's basically the main point that I
want to make.

2418
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:24,559
want to make.
 

2419
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,630
want to make.
And so one thing that you might want to

2420
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:26,640
And so one thing that you might want to
 

2421
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,750
And so one thing that you might want to
think about is like when you're

2422
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:27,760
think about is like when you're
 

2423
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,750
think about is like when you're
debugging a neural network or something

2424
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:29,760
debugging a neural network or something
 

2425
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,990
debugging a neural network or something
isn't working, looking at the

2426
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,000
isn't working, looking at the
 

2427
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,510
isn't working, looking at the
conditioning of your feature matrices is

2428
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:35,520
conditioning of your feature matrices is
 

2429
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,390
conditioning of your feature matrices is
something that can actually

2430
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:38,400
something that can actually
 

2431
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,630
something that can actually
maybe help, right? Some of these

2432
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:40,640
maybe help, right? Some of these
 

2433
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,470
maybe help, right? Some of these
sometimes these are going to be low rank

2434
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:42,480
sometimes these are going to be low rank
 

2435
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,990
sometimes these are going to be low rank
and that's maybe fine. But you know when

2436
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,000
and that's maybe fine. But you know when
 

2437
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,589
and that's maybe fine. But you know when
you're just looking for things to

2438
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:47,599
you're just looking for things to
 

2439
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,430
you're just looking for things to
examine to understand why something

2440
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:49,440
examine to understand why something
 

2441
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,589
examine to understand why something
might not be working,

2442
01:04:51,589 --> 01:04:51,599
might not be working,
 

2443
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,270
might not be working,
checking your normalization, checking

2444
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:53,280
checking your normalization, checking
 

2445
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,870
checking your normalization, checking
the scaling, checking whether these

2446
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,880
the scaling, checking whether these
 

2447
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,190
the scaling, checking whether these
conditionings are okay is is something

2448
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:57,200
conditionings are okay is is something
 

2449
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,950
conditionings are okay is is something
that might might help you in making

2450
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:58,960
that might might help you in making
 

2451
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,190
that might might help you in making
progress.

2452
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:01,200
progress.
 

2453
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,349
progress.
Okay, any questions about this?

2454
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:05,359
Okay, any questions about this?
 

2455
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,390
Okay, any questions about this?
Okay, so good. So now you're all bought

2456
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:08,400
Okay, so good. So now you're all bought
 

2457
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,870
Okay, so good. So now you're all bought
in that your data kind of needs to be in

2458
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:10,880
in that your data kind of needs to be in
 

2459
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,589
in that your data kind of needs to be in
a reasonable range to be able to make

2460
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:13,599
a reasonable range to be able to make
 

2461
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,990
a reasonable range to be able to make
progress, right?

2462
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:16,000
progress, right?
 

2463
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,829
progress, right?
But and I can do whatever I want. So

2464
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:17,839
But and I can do whatever I want. So
 

2465
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:21,589
But and I can do whatever I want. So
let's say I have some neural network.

2466
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:21,599
let's say I have some neural network.
 

2467
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,309
let's say I have some neural network.
I get to control and normalize and

2468
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:24,319
I get to control and normalize and
 

2469
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:28,150
I get to control and normalize and
standardize all I want for this part of

2470
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:28,160
standardize all I want for this part of
 

2471
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,270
standardize all I want for this part of
the input, right? But there's many many

2472
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:31,280
the input, right? But there's many many
 

2473
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,750
the input, right? But there's many many
many many layers.

2474
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:33,760
many many layers.
 

2475
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,190
many many layers.
So for me to be able to have good

2476
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:37,200
So for me to be able to have good
 

2477
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,109
So for me to be able to have good
training, I kind of want to be able to

2478
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:39,119
training, I kind of want to be able to
 

2479
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,109
training, I kind of want to be able to
say something

2480
01:05:41,109 --> 01:05:41,119
say something
 

2481
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,349
say something
about what's happening everywhere in the

2482
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:43,359
about what's happening everywhere in the
 

2483
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:45,589
about what's happening everywhere in the
network, right? Not just standardizing

2484
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:45,599
network, right? Not just standardizing
 

2485
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,870
network, right? Not just standardizing
the the first layer because maybe I'll

2486
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:48,880
the the first layer because maybe I'll
 

2487
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,430
the the first layer because maybe I'll
just standardize the first layer and or

2488
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:51,440
just standardize the first layer and or
 

2489
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,230
just standardize the first layer and or
the input and things might still blow

2490
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:54,240
the input and things might still blow
 

2491
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,430
the input and things might still blow
up. There's all these kinds of weights

2492
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:55,440
up. There's all these kinds of weights
 

2493
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,430
up. There's all these kinds of weights
and biases that are doing who knows what

2494
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:57,440
and biases that are doing who knows what
 

2495
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,470
and biases that are doing who knows what
to my data.

2496
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:00,480
to my data.
 

2497
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,309
to my data.
So what if we what do we do? Let's say

2498
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:02,319
So what if we what do we do? Let's say
 

2499
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:03,510
So what if we what do we do? Let's say
we assume that our input is

2500
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
we assume that our input is
 

2501
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,029
we assume that our input is
standardized. It's mean zero. It's

2502
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:05,039
standardized. It's mean zero. It's
 

2503
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,829
standardized. It's mean zero. It's
variance one. It's very nice. We've

2504
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:07,839
variance one. It's very nice. We've
 

2505
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,789
variance one. It's very nice. We've
cleaned it up. But there's still now we

2506
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:10,799
cleaned it up. But there's still now we
 

2507
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,470
cleaned it up. But there's still now we
want to have a second question that

2508
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:12,480
want to have a second question that
 

2509
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,910
want to have a second question that
shows up is where do we start? How do we

2510
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:15,920
shows up is where do we start? How do we
 

2511
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,589
shows up is where do we start? How do we
initialize our network so that we can

2512
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:19,599
initialize our network so that we can
 

2513
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,029
initialize our network so that we can
train fast and quickly and not run into

2514
01:06:23,029 --> 01:06:23,039
train fast and quickly and not run into
 

2515
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,470
train fast and quickly and not run into
problems where you know things are uh

2516
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:26,480
problems where you know things are uh
 

2517
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,069
problems where you know things are uh
things are blowing up or things are just

2518
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:28,079
things are blowing up or things are just
 

2519
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,950
things are blowing up or things are just
disappearing into zero. How do we try to

2520
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:30,960
disappearing into zero. How do we try to
 

2521
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,950
disappearing into zero. How do we try to
uh do this?

2522
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,960
uh do this?
 

2523
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,470
uh do this?
Well, we want things to be in the

2524
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:34,480
Well, we want things to be in the
 

2525
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,029
Well, we want things to be in the
neighborhood of zero. And so a standard

2526
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:37,039
neighborhood of zero. And so a standard
 

2527
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,390
neighborhood of zero. And so a standard
answer like something that you would

2528
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:38,400
answer like something that you would
 

2529
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,910
answer like something that you would
wish would be true and would work would

2530
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:39,920
wish would be true and would work would
 

2531
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,549
wish would be true and would work would
be to say, well, I really wish I could

2532
01:06:42,549 --> 01:06:42,559
be to say, well, I really wish I could
 

2533
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,069
be to say, well, I really wish I could
just start at zero, right? What's a

2534
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:44,079
just start at zero, right? What's a
 

2535
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,390
just start at zero, right? What's a
better place? I want to be near zero.

2536
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:46,400
better place? I want to be near zero.
 

2537
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,990
better place? I want to be near zero.
So, let me just start all my parameters

2538
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,000
So, let me just start all my parameters
 

2539
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,710
So, let me just start all my parameters
at zero. That would be great, right? I

2540
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:50,720
at zero. That would be great, right? I
 

2541
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,910
at zero. That would be great, right? I
don't if I didn't have to worry about

2542
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:51,920
don't if I didn't have to worry about
 

2543
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,510
don't if I didn't have to worry about
this.

2544
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:53,520
this.
 

2545
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,829
this.
But what's the problem that comes up if

2546
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:55,839
But what's the problem that comes up if
 

2547
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:59,349
But what's the problem that comes up if
I try to put all of my weights to zero?

2548
01:06:59,349 --> 01:06:59,359
I try to put all of my weights to zero?
 

2549
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,190
I try to put all of my weights to zero?
If I initialize all of my weights to

2550
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:01,200
If I initialize all of my weights to
 

2551
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,029
If I initialize all of my weights to
zero, what happens is my input is coming

2552
01:07:03,029 --> 01:07:03,039
zero, what happens is my input is coming
 

2553
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,829
zero, what happens is my input is coming
in and it just get multiplied by 0 0 0

2554
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:07,839
in and it just get multiplied by 0 0 0
 

2555
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,150
in and it just get multiplied by 0 0 0
all I do is I pass in a zero and then

2556
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:10,160
all I do is I pass in a zero and then
 

2557
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,630
all I do is I pass in a zero and then
there's no gradient. The gradients are

2558
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:12,640
there's no gradient. The gradients are
 

2559
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,029
there's no gradient. The gradients are
also zero and then nothing moves

2560
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:15,039
also zero and then nothing moves
 

2561
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:17,750
also zero and then nothing moves
anywhere ever.

2562
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:17,760
anywhere ever.
 

2563
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,270
anywhere ever.
So

2564
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:19,280
So
 

2565
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,950
So
that kind of sucks and that is not

2566
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:20,960
that kind of sucks and that is not
 

2567
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,069
that kind of sucks and that is not
something you want. It wouldn't matter

2568
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
something you want. It wouldn't matter
 

2569
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,069
something you want. It wouldn't matter
for the biases because the biases are

2570
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:24,079
for the biases because the biases are
 

2571
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,710
for the biases because the biases are
only additive. But the weights are

2572
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:26,720
only additive. But the weights are
 

2573
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,950
only additive. But the weights are
multiplicative and so initializing the

2574
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:28,960
multiplicative and so initializing the
 

2575
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,870
multiplicative and so initializing the
weights to zeros is a problem because

2576
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:30,880
weights to zeros is a problem because
 

2577
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,710
weights to zeros is a problem because
you will basically not get any

2578
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:32,720
you will basically not get any
 

2579
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,630
you will basically not get any
gradients. Everything will stagnate.

2580
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:34,640
gradients. Everything will stagnate.
 

2581
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,230
gradients. Everything will stagnate.
Nothing will move. You will not train at

2582
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:36,240
Nothing will move. You will not train at
 

2583
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,349
Nothing will move. You will not train at
all. Okay. So you need to be able to

2584
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:39,359
all. Okay. So you need to be able to
 

2585
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,430
all. Okay. So you need to be able to
have something there that you can

2586
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:41,440
have something there that you can
 

2587
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,910
have something there that you can
actually take gradients on that will

2588
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:43,920
actually take gradients on that will
 

2589
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,470
actually take gradients on that will
allow you to train.

2590
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:46,480
allow you to train.
 

2591
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,109
allow you to train.
So you know what do you what do you want

2592
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:49,119
So you know what do you what do you want
 

2593
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,589
So you know what do you what do you want
to do? Well, you want to initialize them

2594
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:51,599
to do? Well, you want to initialize them
 

2595
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,910
to do? Well, you want to initialize them
so that you can actually

2596
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:53,920
so that you can actually
 

2597
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,950
so that you can actually
get stuff to work.

2598
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:56,960
get stuff to work.
 

2599
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,870
get stuff to work.
And so here we want to make a key

2600
01:07:58,870 --> 01:07:58,880
And so here we want to make a key
 

2601
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,549
And so here we want to make a key
observation is we want to have let's say

2602
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:00,559
observation is we want to have let's say
 

2603
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,670
observation is we want to have let's say
we have some nice standardized input. I

2604
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:03,680
we have some nice standardized input. I
 

2605
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,029
we have some nice standardized input. I
kind of want to be able to make sure

2606
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:05,039
kind of want to be able to make sure
 

2607
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,230
kind of want to be able to make sure
that after it goes through this layer my

2608
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,240
that after it goes through this layer my
 

2609
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,549
that after it goes through this layer my
weights and biases at least initially

2610
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:10,559
weights and biases at least initially
 

2611
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,789
weights and biases at least initially
are not so crazy that whatever I get at

2612
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:14,799
are not so crazy that whatever I get at
 

2613
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,510
are not so crazy that whatever I get at
my output is now a completely totally

2614
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:17,520
my output is now a completely totally
 

2615
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,229
my output is now a completely totally
different distribution. Right? Because

2616
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:20,239
different distribution. Right? Because
 

2617
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:22,470
different distribution. Right? Because
again then for the next layer I want to

2618
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:22,480
again then for the next layer I want to
 

2619
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,470
again then for the next layer I want to
be in the neighborhood of where my

2620
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:24,480
be in the neighborhood of where my
 

2621
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,470
be in the neighborhood of where my
nonlinearities are interesting because

2622
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:26,480
nonlinearities are interesting because
 

2623
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,189
nonlinearities are interesting because
if if if this layer sends everything to

2624
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:29,199
if if if this layer sends everything to
 

2625
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:31,910
if if if this layer sends everything to
the 100 to 200 range then I'm screwed

2626
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:31,920
the 100 to 200 range then I'm screwed
 

2627
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,430
the 100 to 200 range then I'm screwed
again.

2628
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:33,440
again.
 

2629
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,669
again.
Does that make sense to everyone?

2630
01:08:37,669 --> 01:08:37,679

 

2631
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,110

Okay.

2632
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:41,120

 

2633
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,669

So our goal is basically to say that can

2634
01:08:43,669 --> 01:08:43,679
So our goal is basically to say that can
 

2635
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,309
So our goal is basically to say that can
we somehow have the inputs to every

2636
01:08:46,309 --> 01:08:46,319
we somehow have the inputs to every
 

2637
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,630
we somehow have the inputs to every
layer be standardized at least at

2638
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
layer be standardized at least at
 

2639
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,229
layer be standardized at least at
initialization because that's what we

2640
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:50,239
initialization because that's what we
 

2641
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,309
initialization because that's what we
control. Whatever happens once we start

2642
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:52,319
control. Whatever happens once we start
 

2643
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,669
control. Whatever happens once we start
training will happen. But at

2644
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:53,679
training will happen. But at
 

2645
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,189
training will happen. But at
initialization

2646
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:55,199
initialization
 

2647
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:56,789
initialization
can we have that can we have that

2648
01:08:56,789 --> 01:08:56,799
can we have that can we have that
 

2649
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,510
can we have that can we have that
basically the statistical properties

2650
01:08:59,510 --> 01:08:59,520
basically the statistical properties
 

2651
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,870
basically the statistical properties
at these output activations are the same

2652
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:02,880
at these output activations are the same
 

2653
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,189
at these output activations are the same
same as the statistic properties here

2654
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:05,199
same as the statistic properties here
 

2655
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:06,950
same as the statistic properties here
because basically the output activations

2656
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:06,960
because basically the output activations
 

2657
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,430
because basically the output activations
from this layer are the input

2658
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:09,440
from this layer are the input
 

2659
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,669
from this layer are the input
activations for the are the inputs for

2660
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:11,679
activations for the are the inputs for
 

2661
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:14,149
activations for the are the inputs for
the next layer. Right? Does that make

2662
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:14,159
the next layer. Right? Does that make
 

2663
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:16,390
the next layer. Right? Does that make
sense to everyone? Like what that's our

2664
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:16,400
sense to everyone? Like what that's our
 

2665
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,189
sense to everyone? Like what that's our
that's our rough rough goal. And does

2666
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:19,199
that's our rough rough goal. And does
 

2667
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:20,309
that's our rough rough goal. And does
everyone see why this is like a

2668
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:20,319
everyone see why this is like a
 

2669
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,870
everyone see why this is like a
reasonable thing to want?

2670
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:22,880
reasonable thing to want?
 

2671
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,070
reasonable thing to want?
Okay, good. So that brings me to talking

2672
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:26,080
Okay, good. So that brings me to talking
 

2673
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,669
Okay, good. So that brings me to talking
about uh Xavier or Glor uh

2674
01:09:29,669 --> 01:09:29,679
about uh Xavier or Glor uh
 

2675
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,510
about uh Xavier or Glor uh
initialization and this is

2676
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:31,520
initialization and this is
 

2677
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,269
initialization and this is
initialization for the weights of the

2678
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:33,279
initialization for the weights of the
 

2679
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:34,470
initialization for the weights of the
network. So the weights are basically

2680
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,480
network. So the weights are basically
 

2681
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,910
network. So the weights are basically
the parameters that are multiplying the

2682
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:35,920
the parameters that are multiplying the
 

2683
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,349
the parameters that are multiplying the
data. The biases are the things that are

2684
01:09:37,349 --> 01:09:37,359
data. The biases are the things that are
 

2685
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:41,269
data. The biases are the things that are
adding in.

2686
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:41,279

 

2687
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,510

So basically

2688
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:43,520
So basically
 

2689
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,349
So basically
what this is observing is that look your

2690
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:47,359
what this is observing is that look your
 

2691
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:48,789
what this is observing is that look your
neural networks are going to have

2692
01:09:48,789 --> 01:09:48,799
neural networks are going to have
 

2693
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:51,189
neural networks are going to have
different architecture

2694
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:51,199
different architecture
 

2695
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:53,430
different architecture
and the architecture of your neural

2696
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:53,440
and the architecture of your neural
 

2697
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,590
and the architecture of your neural
network is going to somehow in some

2698
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:55,600
network is going to somehow in some
 

2699
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,590
network is going to somehow in some
sense determine

2700
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:57,600
sense determine
 

2701
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,950
sense determine
or it's going not going to determine but

2702
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
or it's going not going to determine but
 

2703
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,149
or it's going not going to determine but
it's going to influence how big or small

2704
01:10:02,149 --> 01:10:02,159
it's going to influence how big or small
 

2705
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,390
it's going to influence how big or small
your different quantities

2706
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:04,400
your different quantities
 

2707
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,709
your different quantities
will actually get.

2708
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:06,719
will actually get.
 

2709
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,790
will actually get.
So for example, if I have some inputs,

2710
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:08,800
So for example, if I have some inputs,
 

2711
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,790
So for example, if I have some inputs,
let's say I have a fan in, I'm going to

2712
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:10,800
let's say I have a fan in, I'm going to
 

2713
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,229
let's say I have a fan in, I'm going to
call this fan in of D. And so I have

2714
01:10:14,229 --> 01:10:14,239
call this fan in of D. And so I have
 

2715
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,229
call this fan in of D. And so I have
this input, it gets multiplied by W1,

2716
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:16,239
this input, it gets multiplied by W1,
 

2717
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:19,590
this input, it gets multiplied by W1,
this by W2, this W, whatever W3. I add

2718
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:19,600
this by W2, this W, whatever W3. I add
 

2719
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,270
this by W2, this W, whatever W3. I add
them up, I add my bias term, it goes

2720
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:21,280
them up, I add my bias term, it goes
 

2721
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,470
them up, I add my bias term, it goes
into a nonlinearity, and it uh it comes

2722
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:24,480
into a nonlinearity, and it uh it comes
 

2723
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,630
into a nonlinearity, and it uh it comes
out.

2724
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:26,640
out.
 

2725
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,350
out.
Let's say I want to have that my input

2726
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:29,360
Let's say I want to have that my input
 

2727
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,430
Let's say I want to have that my input
to my nonlinearity which is where I want

2728
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:31,440
to my nonlinearity which is where I want
 

2729
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,030
to my nonlinearity which is where I want
which is where my you know I want to

2730
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:33,040
which is where my you know I want to
 

2731
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,470
which is where my you know I want to
make sure that that is standardized in a

2732
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:34,480
make sure that that is standardized in a
 

2733
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,229
make sure that that is standardized in a
way that it's going to actually be in

2734
01:10:36,229 --> 01:10:36,239
way that it's going to actually be in
 

2735
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:37,750
way that it's going to actually be in
the neighborhood of the interesting

2736
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:37,760
the neighborhood of the interesting
 

2737
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,990
the neighborhood of the interesting
stuff. So I want it to be approximately

2738
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:40,000
stuff. So I want it to be approximately
 

2739
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,149
stuff. So I want it to be approximately
zero mean. I want it to be approximately

2740
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:42,159
zero mean. I want it to be approximately
 

2741
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:44,390
zero mean. I want it to be approximately
unit variance.

2742
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:44,400
unit variance.
 

2743
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,790
unit variance.
And I'm assuming that say that my inputs

2744
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:46,800
And I'm assuming that say that my inputs
 

2745
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,350
And I'm assuming that say that my inputs
are all approximately zero mean and unit

2746
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:49,360
are all approximately zero mean and unit
 

2747
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,270
are all approximately zero mean and unit
variance because I've standardized them.

2748
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:51,280
variance because I've standardized them.
 

2749
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,910
variance because I've standardized them.
Right?

2750
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:53,920
Right?
 

2751
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,709
Right?
So now what can I do? What do I need to

2752
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:56,719
So now what can I do? What do I need to
 

2753
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:00,630
So now what can I do? What do I need to
do to kind of make sure that the stuff

2754
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:00,640
do to kind of make sure that the stuff
 

2755
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:05,350
do to kind of make sure that the stuff
here

2756
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:05,360

 

2757
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,430

is approximately

2758
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:07,440
is approximately
 

2759
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,270
is approximately
has the same statistical properties or

2760
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:09,280
has the same statistical properties or
 

2761
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,590
has the same statistical properties or
has the zero mean unit variance property

2762
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:11,600
has the zero mean unit variance property
 

2763
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,189
has the zero mean unit variance property
as these inputs here did.

2764
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:15,199
as these inputs here did.
 

2765
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,669
as these inputs here did.
So yeah, we have one minute. Why don't

2766
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:17,679
So yeah, we have one minute. Why don't
 

2767
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,590
So yeah, we have one minute. Why don't
you think about it before I just walk

2768
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:19,600
you think about it before I just walk
 

2769
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,510
you think about it before I just walk
through the answer?

2770
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:23,520

 

2771
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,270

Feel

2772
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:25,280
Feel
 

2773
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,149
Feel
free to talk just yeah

2774
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:28,159
free to talk just yeah
 

2775
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,790
free to talk just yeah
remember your probability linearity of

2776
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:30,800
remember your probability linearity of
 

2777
01:11:30,800 --> 01:12:19,270
remember your probability linearity of
expectation things like that

2778
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:19,280

 

2779
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:46,630

Galaxy

2780
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:46,640

 

2781
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,350

Okay.

2782
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:49,360
Okay.
 

2783
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,790
Okay.
So here, okay, anyone? So what is the

2784
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:52,800
So here, okay, anyone? So what is the
 

2785
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,390
So here, okay, anyone? So what is the
thought right here? If I have a bunch of

2786
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:54,400
thought right here? If I have a bunch of
 

2787
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,110
thought right here? If I have a bunch of
normal 01s coming in,

2788
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:57,120
normal 01s coming in,
 

2789
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,510
normal 01s coming in,
let's say if I call these

2790
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,520

 

2791
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,870

um what should I call them? I can call

2792
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:02,880
um what should I call them? I can call
 

2793
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,590
um what should I call them? I can call
them H1, H2,

2794
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:05,600
them H1, H2,
 

2795
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,070
them H1, H2,
H

2796
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:08,080
H
 

2797
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,550
H
D I guess.

2798
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:10,560
D I guess.
 

2799
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,189
D I guess.
Then I want to look at the variance.

2800
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:15,199

 

2801
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:20,630

I should add a page.

2802
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:20,640

 

2803
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,189

I want to look at the variance

2804
01:13:23,189 --> 01:13:23,199
I want to look at the variance
 

2805
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:28,470
I want to look at the variance
of

2806
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:28,480

 

2807
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,790

this thing, right?

2808
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:30,800
this thing, right?
 

2809
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,830
this thing, right?
Because

2810
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:33,840

 

2811
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,590

Let's say B is just zero. Let's just say

2812
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
Let's say B is just zero. Let's just say
 

2813
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,990
Let's say B is just zero. Let's just say
I choose to initialize the bias to zero

2814
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:38,000
I choose to initialize the bias to zero
 

2815
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,390
I choose to initialize the bias to zero
and kind of don't worry about the bias

2816
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:40,400
and kind of don't worry about the bias
 

2817
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,870
and kind of don't worry about the bias
in initialization because the bias

2818
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:42,880
in initialization because the bias
 

2819
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,510
in initialization because the bias
initialization is not as big a deal.

2820
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:45,520
initialization is not as big a deal.
 

2821
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,430
initialization is not as big a deal.
It's not going to cause me to blow up or

2822
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:47,440
It's not going to cause me to blow up or
 

2823
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,229
It's not going to cause me to blow up or
die out to zero.

2824
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:50,239
die out to zero.
 

2825
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:53,510
die out to zero.
But I look at this variance

2826
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:53,520
But I look at this variance
 

2827
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,030
But I look at this variance
or I want to look at this variance

2828
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:55,040
or I want to look at this variance
 

2829
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,870
or I want to look at this variance
because basically this variance is the

2830
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:56,880
because basically this variance is the
 

2831
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,310
because basically this variance is the
variance of what's going to show up

2832
01:13:58,310 --> 01:13:58,320
variance of what's going to show up
 

2833
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,030
variance of what's going to show up
here. Right? Now, if I add a bunch of

2834
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,040
here. Right? Now, if I add a bunch of
 

2835
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,709
here. Right? Now, if I add a bunch of
zero mean things, let's say all of these

2836
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:02,719
zero mean things, let's say all of these
 

2837
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,550
zero mean things, let's say all of these
are zero mean. What is going to be the

2838
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:04,560
are zero mean. What is going to be the
 

2839
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,470
are zero mean. What is going to be the
mean of the thing that shows up here?

2840
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:08,480
mean of the thing that shows up here?
 

2841
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,990
mean of the thing that shows up here?
They're all going to be zero, right?

2842
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:10,000
They're all going to be zero, right?
 

2843
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,310
They're all going to be zero, right?
Because these um

2844
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:14,320
Because these um
 

2845
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,990
Because these um
hi and wi are they're independent.

2846
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,000
hi and wi are they're independent.
 

2847
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,390
hi and wi are they're independent.
So, I can just think of their product as

2848
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,400
So, I can just think of their product as
 

2849
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,229
So, I can just think of their product as
the the product of the expectations is

2850
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:22,239
the the product of the expectations is
 

2851
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,310
the the product of the expectations is
the expectation of the product. And so

2852
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:24,320
the expectation of the product. And so
 

2853
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,430
the expectation of the product. And so
if my WIS are all zero mean, then even

2854
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:27,440
if my WIS are all zero mean, then even
 

2855
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,149
if my WIS are all zero mean, then even
if these are not zero mean, they are,

2856
01:14:30,149 --> 01:14:30,159
if these are not zero mean, they are,
 

2857
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,870
if these are not zero mean, they are,
but I would still get a zero mean thing

2858
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:32,880
but I would still get a zero mean thing
 

2859
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,270
but I would still get a zero mean thing
here.

2860
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:35,280
here.
 

2861
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,870
here.
And now I want to look at this variance

2862
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:36,880
And now I want to look at this variance
 

2863
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,390
And now I want to look at this variance
here. So what is this variance? Well, I

2864
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:40,400
here. So what is this variance? Well, I
 

2865
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,470
here. So what is this variance? Well, I
can think of this as the expected value

2866
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,480
can think of this as the expected value
 

2867
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,950
can think of this as the expected value
of

2868
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:44,960
of
 

2869
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,149
of
sigma wi hi

2870
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:48,159
sigma wi hi
 

2871
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,990
sigma wi hi
squared

2872
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:50,000
squared
 

2873
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:58,790
squared
minus the expected value of

2874
01:14:58,790 --> 01:14:58,800

 

2875
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,709

the expected value of the square minus

2876
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:00,719
the expected value of the square minus
 

2877
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:04,870
the expected value of the square minus
the square of the expected value.

2878
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:04,880
the square of the expected value.
 

2879
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,510
the square of the expected value.
Okay,

2880
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:07,520
Okay,
 

2881
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,590
Okay,
but I already know that the square of

2882
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:09,600
but I already know that the square of
 

2883
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,310
but I already know that the square of
this expected value

2884
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:12,320
this expected value
 

2885
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:20,149
this expected value
this thing is zero.

2886
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:20,159

 

2887
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:22,630

And now because

2888
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:22,640
And now because
 

2889
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,830
And now because
W and H are independent

2890
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:25,840
W and H are independent
 

2891
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,430
W and H are independent
and are zero mean, I can just write this

2892
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:29,440
and are zero mean, I can just write this
 

2893
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,990
and are zero mean, I can just write this
further

2894
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:32,000
further
 

2895
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,390
further
as the expected value of WI^ 2 times the

2896
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,400
as the expected value of WI^ 2 times the
 

2897
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:58,470
as the expected value of WI^ 2 times the
expected value of HI 2.

2898
01:15:58,470 --> 01:15:58,480

 

2899
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,630

Okay. And so with this now, basically if

2900
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:02,640
Okay. And so with this now, basically if
 

2901
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,990
Okay. And so with this now, basically if
I'm adding d of these things together,

2902
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,000
I'm adding d of these things together,
 

2903
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,630
I'm adding d of these things together,
what do I need to have each of these be

2904
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:08,640
what do I need to have each of these be
 

2905
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,990
what do I need to have each of these be
so that the output is one?

2906
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:12,000
so that the output is one?
 

2907
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,430
so that the output is one?
Right? Well, I want to have this guy

2908
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:15,440
Right? Well, I want to have this guy
 

2909
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,990
Right? Well, I want to have this guy
all be like one overd so that when I

2910
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,000
all be like one overd so that when I
 

2911
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,990
all be like one overd so that when I
multiply by one and I add d of them, I'm

2912
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:20,000
multiply by one and I add d of them, I'm
 

2913
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,709
multiply by one and I add d of them, I'm
going to get one out. Right? So if I

2914
01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:22,719
going to get one out. Right? So if I
 

2915
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:25,990
going to get one out. Right? So if I
want the variance here

2916
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,000
want the variance here
 

2917
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,630
want the variance here
to be one,

2918
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:28,640
to be one,
 

2919
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,590
to be one,
not here, here I want the variance here

2920
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:31,600
not here, here I want the variance here
 

2921
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,630
not here, here I want the variance here
to be one. I want these things to be

2922
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:34,640
to be one. I want these things to be
 

2923
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,669
to be one. I want these things to be
initialized essentially as a normal with

2924
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
initialized essentially as a normal with
 

2925
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:42,470
initialized essentially as a normal with
mean zero and variance one overd.

2926
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480

 

2927
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,390

The idea is that if you have more things

2928
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:44,400
The idea is that if you have more things
 

2929
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,709
The idea is that if you have more things
adding in that's going to add to your

2930
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:46,719
adding in that's going to add to your
 

2931
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,950
adding in that's going to add to your
variance. Make sure you the variance of

2932
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:48,960
variance. Make sure you the variance of
 

2933
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,470
variance. Make sure you the variance of
the individual things that are adding in

2934
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:50,480
the individual things that are adding in
 

2935
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,470
the individual things that are adding in
is appropriately small so that when they

2936
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:52,480
is appropriately small so that when they
 

2937
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,229
is appropriately small so that when they
add up together their variance is not

2938
01:16:54,229 --> 01:16:54,239
add up together their variance is not
 

2939
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,990
add up together their variance is not
too large.

2940
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:56,000
too large.
 

2941
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,350
too large.
Okay. So this is the key idea behind

2942
01:16:59,350 --> 01:16:59,360
Okay. So this is the key idea behind
 

2943
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,590
Okay. So this is the key idea behind
Xavier initialization that talks about

2944
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:01,600
Xavier initialization that talks about
 

2945
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,110
Xavier initialization that talks about
this dependence on the architecture of

2946
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:05,120
this dependence on the architecture of
 

2947
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,630
this dependence on the architecture of
the neural network and particularly the

2948
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:06,640
the neural network and particularly the
 

2949
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:11,189
the neural network and particularly the
fan in at every point. Okay.

2950
01:17:11,189 --> 01:17:11,199
fan in at every point. Okay.
 

2951
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:12,790
fan in at every point. Okay.
Now when you look at actual

2952
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:12,800
Now when you look at actual
 

2953
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,270
Now when you look at actual
implementations in Xavier

2954
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:15,280
implementations in Xavier
 

2955
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,510
implementations in Xavier
um there's sometimes a dependence on the

2956
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:17,520
um there's sometimes a dependence on the
 

2957
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,910
um there's sometimes a dependence on the
fan out and you can do different vision

2958
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:19,920
fan out and you can do different vision
 

2959
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,310
fan out and you can do different vision
variations but the key idea here is to

2960
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:22,320
variations but the key idea here is to
 

2961
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,470
variations but the key idea here is to
realize that what you're trying to do is

2962
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:24,480
realize that what you're trying to do is
 

2963
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,030
realize that what you're trying to do is
you're trying to make sure that things

2964
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,040
you're trying to make sure that things
 

2965
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,110
you're trying to make sure that things
aren't getting too big or too small

2966
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:29,120
aren't getting too big or too small
 

2967
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,750
aren't getting too big or too small
based on the particular architecture of

2968
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:31,760
based on the particular architecture of
 

2969
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,510
based on the particular architecture of
the network at every different point.

2970
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:33,520
the network at every different point.
 

2971
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,950
the network at every different point.
Okay, that's the the key thing that uh

2972
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:36,960
Okay, that's the the key thing that uh
 

2973
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,790
Okay, that's the the key thing that uh
you want to I want to say. The other

2974
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:38,800
you want to I want to say. The other
 

2975
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,110
you want to I want to say. The other
thing that I want to say is that it's

2976
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:41,120
thing that I want to say is that it's
 

2977
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,590
thing that I want to say is that it's
worth sometimes looking at the default

2978
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:43,600
worth sometimes looking at the default
 

2979
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,590
worth sometimes looking at the default
parameter settings because the default

2980
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:45,600
parameter settings because the default
 

2981
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,470
parameter settings because the default
parameter settings on the

2982
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:46,480
parameter settings on the
 

2983
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,310
parameter settings on the
initializations may or may not do

2984
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:48,320
initializations may or may not do
 

2985
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,470
initializations may or may not do
exactly what you want it to do. But

2986
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:50,480
exactly what you want it to do. But
 

2987
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,270
exactly what you want it to do. But
thinking about what do I want my values

2988
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:53,280
thinking about what do I want my values
 

2989
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,350
thinking about what do I want my values
to behave like or look like as they go

2990
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:55,360
to behave like or look like as they go
 

2991
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,270
to behave like or look like as they go
through um can is a good way of thinking

2992
01:17:59,270 --> 01:17:59,280
through um can is a good way of thinking
 

2993
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,750
through um can is a good way of thinking
about it. Sometimes you care also about

2994
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:01,760
about it. Sometimes you care also about
 

2995
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,550
about it. Sometimes you care also about
the fan out. So what is happening here?

2996
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
the fan out. So what is happening here?
 

2997
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,750
the fan out. So what is happening here?
we just assume that there's only one

2998
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:05,760
we just assume that there's only one
 

2999
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,270
we just assume that there's only one
thing but you might be going to

3000
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:07,280
thing but you might be going to
 

3001
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,030
thing but you might be going to
different places. So that's something to

3002
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:09,040
different places. So that's something to
 

3003
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,110
different places. So that's something to
to think about. Okay,

3004
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:13,120
to think about. Okay,
 

3005
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,229
to think about. Okay,
the last thing what I want to talk about

3006
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:16,239
the last thing what I want to talk about
 

3007
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:18,070
the last thing what I want to talk about
and if I have a few minutes I'll come

3008
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:18,080
and if I have a few minutes I'll come
 

3009
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,110
and if I have a few minutes I'll come
back to this Xavier initialization but I

3010
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:21,120
back to this Xavier initialization but I
 

3011
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,750
back to this Xavier initialization but I
want to talk about H initialization

3012
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:23,760
want to talk about H initialization
 

3013
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,990
want to talk about H initialization
which is a different which is a

3014
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,000
which is a different which is a
 

3015
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,990
which is a different which is a
different initialization

3016
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,000
different initialization
 

3017
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,630
different initialization
and what people noticed was that the

3018
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:30,640
and what people noticed was that the
 

3019
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,590
and what people noticed was that the
Xavier initialization does not work well

3020
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:33,600
Xavier initialization does not work well
 

3021
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,830
Xavier initialization does not work well
when the previous layer is a relu

3022
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:37,840
when the previous layer is a relu
 

3023
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,630
when the previous layer is a relu
and why is that the case.

3024
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:40,640
and why is that the case.
 

3025
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,630
and why is that the case.
Well, turns out when I look at a relu,

3026
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:42,640
Well, turns out when I look at a relu,
 

3027
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,750
Well, turns out when I look at a relu,
what does a relu look like?

3028
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:45,760
what does a relu look like?
 

3029
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,110
what does a relu look like?
A relu looks like a lot of zero for a

3030
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:49,120
A relu looks like a lot of zero for a
 

3031
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,630
A relu looks like a lot of zero for a
long time and then stuff starts

3032
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:50,640
long time and then stuff starts
 

3033
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,189
long time and then stuff starts
happening. Okay. And this corner

3034
01:18:53,189 --> 01:18:53,199
happening. Okay. And this corner
 

3035
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:54,950
happening. Okay. And this corner
essentially is around zero. So half of

3036
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:54,960
essentially is around zero. So half of
 

3037
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,030
essentially is around zero. So half of
the time

3038
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:57,040
the time
 

3039
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,830
the time
I'm going to have my ReLU output a zero

3040
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840
I'm going to have my ReLU output a zero
 

3041
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,390
I'm going to have my ReLU output a zero
and the other half of the time I'm going

3042
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:02,400
and the other half of the time I'm going
 

3043
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,870
and the other half of the time I'm going
to have you know the identity function

3044
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:04,880
to have you know the identity function
 

3045
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,110
to have you know the identity function
come out.

3046
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,120
come out.
 

3047
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,270
come out.
So maybe if I'm coming if I'm looking at

3048
01:19:09,270 --> 01:19:09,280
So maybe if I'm coming if I'm looking at
 

3049
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,990
So maybe if I'm coming if I'm looking at
things from a ReLU perspective, my true

3050
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:12,000
things from a ReLU perspective, my true
 

3051
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,669
things from a ReLU perspective, my true
fan in is not actually D, but it's only

3052
01:19:15,669 --> 01:19:15,679
fan in is not actually D, but it's only
 

3053
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,830
fan in is not actually D, but it's only
half of D because half of those have

3054
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:17,840
half of D because half of those have
 

3055
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,350
half of D because half of those have
been zeroed out by the previous ReLU.

3056
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:21,360
been zeroed out by the previous ReLU.
 

3057
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,149
been zeroed out by the previous ReLU.
Does everyone see that?

3058
01:19:24,149 --> 01:19:24,159
Does everyone see that?
 

3059
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,110
Does everyone see that?
And so maybe a better initialization is

3060
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:27,120
And so maybe a better initialization is
 

3061
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,790
And so maybe a better initialization is
to account for the fact that half of my

3062
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:28,800
to account for the fact that half of my
 

3063
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,470
to account for the fact that half of my
stuff is going to be zero and put a d

3064
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,480
stuff is going to be zero and put a d
 

3065
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,950
stuff is going to be zero and put a d
over two here

3066
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:34,960
over two here
 

3067
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,110
over two here
which looks as like so I'm writing this

3068
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:37,120
which looks as like so I'm writing this
 

3069
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,709
which looks as like so I'm writing this
this way so that it's clear where that

3070
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:38,719
this way so that it's clear where that
 

3071
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,070
this way so that it's clear where that
two is coming from. If you write it this

3072
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:40,080
two is coming from. If you write it this
 

3073
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,709
two is coming from. If you write it this
way it's a little bit harder to see.

3074
01:19:42,709 --> 01:19:42,719
way it's a little bit harder to see.
 

3075
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,750
way it's a little bit harder to see.
Okay but this is the h initialization

3076
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:45,760
Okay but this is the h initialization
 

3077
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,110
Okay but this is the h initialization
and it turns out that this actually

3078
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:47,120
and it turns out that this actually
 

3079
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,189
and it turns out that this actually
matters in it actually helps improve

3080
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:49,199
matters in it actually helps improve
 

3081
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:50,709
matters in it actually helps improve
performance to use the hood

3082
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:50,719
performance to use the hood
 

3083
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:51,990
performance to use the hood
initialization over the Xavier

3084
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:52,000
initialization over the Xavier
 

3085
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,030
initialization over the Xavier
initialization. And it was actually

3086
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,040
initialization. And it was actually
 

3087
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,669
initialization. And it was actually
developed because people noticed that

3088
01:19:55,669 --> 01:19:55,679
developed because people noticed that
 

3089
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,830
developed because people noticed that
things were not working uh for ReLU

3090
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:57,840
things were not working uh for ReLU
 

3091
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:02,870
things were not working uh for ReLU
networks. Okay.

3092
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:02,880

 

3093
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,630

And in light of this, I want to point

3094
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:04,640
And in light of this, I want to point
 

3095
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,950
And in light of this, I want to point
out something about the about the Xavier

3096
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:06,960
out something about the about the Xavier
 

3097
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,189
out something about the about the Xavier
initialization. So there's a little bit

3098
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:09,199
initialization. So there's a little bit
 

3099
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:11,990
initialization. So there's a little bit
of a

3100
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:12,000
of a
 

3101
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,630
of a
trickery or not fully rigorous thing

3102
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:14,640
trickery or not fully rigorous thing
 

3103
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,870
trickery or not fully rigorous thing
that I I've done is that I said that I

3104
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:16,880
that I I've done is that I said that I
 

3105
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,149
that I I've done is that I said that I
wanted to use like an inductive argument

3106
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:20,159
wanted to use like an inductive argument
 

3107
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,550
wanted to use like an inductive argument
to say that

3108
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:22,560
to say that
 

3109
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,070
to say that
oh you know if my input is standardized

3110
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:26,080
oh you know if my input is standardized
 

3111
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,590
oh you know if my input is standardized
here well I want to initialize so it's

3112
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:27,600
here well I want to initialize so it's
 

3113
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,189
here well I want to initialize so it's
good here if it's good here it'll be

3114
01:20:29,189 --> 01:20:29,199
good here if it's good here it'll be
 

3115
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:30,550
good here if it's good here it'll be
good here if it's good here it'll be

3116
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:30,560
good here if it's good here it'll be
 

3117
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,550
good here if it's good here it'll be
good here

3118
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:32,560
good here
 

3119
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,350
good here
but here we're actually looking

3120
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:35,360
but here we're actually looking
 

3121
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,270
but here we're actually looking
before the nonlinearity right I gave you

3122
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:37,280
before the nonlinearity right I gave you
 

3123
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,550
before the nonlinearity right I gave you
a guarant guarantee on what's happening

3124
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:38,560
a guarant guarantee on what's happening
 

3125
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,550
a guarant guarantee on what's happening
before the nonlinearity.

3126
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:40,560
before the nonlinearity.
 

3127
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,470
before the nonlinearity.
I'm not actually giving you a guarantee

3128
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,480
I'm not actually giving you a guarantee
 

3129
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,830
I'm not actually giving you a guarantee
on what's happening after the

3130
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:43,840
on what's happening after the
 

3131
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,430
on what's happening after the
nonlinearity.

3132
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:45,440
nonlinearity.
 

3133
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,070
nonlinearity.
Whereas if you look at the H

3134
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:48,080
Whereas if you look at the H
 

3135
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,630
Whereas if you look at the H
initialization, it's kind of kind of

3136
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:50,640
initialization, it's kind of kind of
 

3137
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,350
initialization, it's kind of kind of
taking into account the nonlinearity and

3138
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:53,360
taking into account the nonlinearity and
 

3139
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,350
taking into account the nonlinearity and
it's talking about if you do this well,

3140
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:55,360
it's talking about if you do this well,
 

3141
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,550
it's talking about if you do this well,
you know, half of the time you're going

3142
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:56,560
you know, half of the time you're going
 

3143
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,709
you know, half of the time you're going
to be zero, you know, other half of the

3144
01:20:58,709 --> 01:20:58,719
to be zero, you know, other half of the
 

3145
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,310
to be zero, you know, other half of the
time you're identity. So maybe you're

3146
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:00,320
time you're identity. So maybe you're
 

3147
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,550
time you're identity. So maybe you're
going to be approximately

3148
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:02,560
going to be approximately
 

3149
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,750
going to be approximately
u approximately good. So there's a

3150
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:05,760
u approximately good. So there's a
 

3151
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,830
u approximately good. So there's a
slight difference in in how these two

3152
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:07,840
slight difference in in how these two
 

3153
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,950
slight difference in in how these two
perspectives are looking at it and if

3154
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:08,960
perspectives are looking at it and if
 

3155
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,350
perspectives are looking at it and if
you in Xavier initialization

3156
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:11,360
you in Xavier initialization
 

3157
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,510
you in Xavier initialization
you might have to do other things to

3158
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
you might have to do other things to
 

3159
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,270
you might have to do other things to
sometimes make your data be normalized

3160
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,280
sometimes make your data be normalized
 

3161
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,950
sometimes make your data be normalized
or nice and when you talk about

3162
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:16,960
or nice and when you talk about
 

3163
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,310
or nice and when you talk about
constants I guess you'll be talking

3164
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:18,320
constants I guess you'll be talking
 

3165
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,390
constants I guess you'll be talking
about things like batch uh about

3166
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:20,400
about things like batch uh about
 

3167
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,110
about things like batch uh about
normalizations at every layer so that

3168
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:23,120
normalizations at every layer so that
 

3169
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:26,310
normalizations at every layer so that
you can uh you know make sure that

3170
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:26,320
you can uh you know make sure that
 

3171
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,990
you can uh you know make sure that
things are still being kind of be

3172
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:28,000
things are still being kind of be
 

3173
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,229
things are still being kind of be
behaving kind of reasonably.

3174
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:30,239
behaving kind of reasonably.
 

3175
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:32,790
behaving kind of reasonably.
Okay. Yes. Question. I've seen some

3176
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:32,800
Okay. Yes. Question. I've seen some
 

3177
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,350
Okay. Yes. Question. I've seen some
variations of these initialization

3178
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:35,360
variations of these initialization
 

3179
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,189
variations of these initialization
algorithms to like utilize the fan out.

3180
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:37,199
algorithms to like utilize the fan out.
 

3181
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:40,229
algorithms to like utilize the fan out.
So you normalize the backwards. Yes. You

3182
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:40,239
So you normalize the backwards. Yes. You
 

3183
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:42,070
So you normalize the backwards. Yes. You
ever need to do that?

3184
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:42,080
ever need to do that?
 

3185
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,950
ever need to do that?
>> So um the question is like you know when

3186
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:44,960
>> So um the question is like you know when
 

3187
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,550
>> So um the question is like you know when
you look at when you when you Google

3188
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:46,560
you look at when you when you Google
 

3189
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,870
you look at when you when you Google
Xavier initialization for example you

3190
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:48,880
Xavier initialization for example you
 

3191
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,669
Xavier initialization for example you
will often see something that looks at d

3192
01:21:51,669 --> 01:21:51,679
will often see something that looks at d
 

3193
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:53,910
will often see something that looks at d
what like instead of one overd fan in

3194
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:53,920
what like instead of one overd fan in
 

3195
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,189
what like instead of one overd fan in
it's one overd fan in plus one overd fan

3196
01:21:57,189 --> 01:21:57,199
it's one overd fan in plus one overd fan
 

3197
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,790
it's one overd fan in plus one overd fan
out. And the

3198
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:00,800
out. And the
 

3199
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,750
out. And the
the reason for that is that sometimes if

3200
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:03,760
the reason for that is that sometimes if
 

3201
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,030
the reason for that is that sometimes if
you're looking at what's happening on

3202
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,040
you're looking at what's happening on
 

3203
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:09,030
you're looking at what's happening on
the backward pass, you have uh you you

3204
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:09,040
the backward pass, you have uh you you
 

3205
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,709
the backward pass, you have uh you you
you also want to take into account

3206
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:10,719
you also want to take into account
 

3207
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,229
you also want to take into account
what's happening on the gradient. So the

3208
01:22:12,229 --> 01:22:12,239
what's happening on the gradient. So the
 

3209
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,510
what's happening on the gradient. So the
forward pass is looking at just the

3210
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:13,520
forward pass is looking at just the
 

3211
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,709
forward pass is looking at just the
values. What's happening on the backward

3212
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:14,719
values. What's happening on the backward
 

3213
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:17,430
values. What's happening on the backward
pass is the gradient.

3214
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:17,440
pass is the gradient.
 

3215
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,430
pass is the gradient.
The thing the reality is that sometimes

3216
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:19,440
The thing the reality is that sometimes
 

3217
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,669
The thing the reality is that sometimes
it just doesn't matter too much because

3218
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
it just doesn't matter too much because
 

3219
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:24,470
it just doesn't matter too much because
these numbers are all not that uh not

3220
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:24,480
these numbers are all not that uh not
 

3221
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,229
these numbers are all not that uh not
that bad.

3222
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:26,239
that bad.
 

3223
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,830
that bad.
The other thing is that if it works, it

3224
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:27,840
The other thing is that if it works, it
 

3225
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,870
The other thing is that if it works, it
works. So there is not as clean an

3226
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:30,880
works. So there is not as clean an
 

3227
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:35,430
works. So there is not as clean an
intuition. Um though one way of thinking

3228
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:35,440
intuition. Um though one way of thinking
 

3229
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,189
intuition. Um though one way of thinking
about it is that well on the forward

3230
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
about it is that well on the forward
 

3231
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:39,510
about it is that well on the forward
pass you want one over D fan in. On the

3232
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:39,520
pass you want one over D fan in. On the
 

3233
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,430
pass you want one over D fan in. On the
backward pass you want one over D fan

3234
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:41,440
backward pass you want one over D fan
 

3235
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,750
backward pass you want one over D fan
out. You choose the best of both worlds

3236
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:43,760
out. You choose the best of both worlds
 

3237
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,430
out. You choose the best of both worlds
and you choose one over D fan out plus

3238
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:45,440
and you choose one over D fan out plus
 

3239
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,229
and you choose one over D fan out plus
fan in as like a midway of making

3240
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:48,239
fan in as like a midway of making
 

3241
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,070
fan in as like a midway of making
everyone happy. And if it works

3242
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,080
everyone happy. And if it works
 

3243
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:53,510
everyone happy. And if it works
reasonably well, you're happy. So, uh,

3244
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:53,520
reasonably well, you're happy. So, uh,
 

3245
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,709
reasonably well, you're happy. So, uh,
sometimes you have to worry about it,

3246
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:54,719
sometimes you have to worry about it,
 

3247
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,470
sometimes you have to worry about it,
sometimes you don't. It kind of will

3248
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:56,480
sometimes you don't. It kind of will
 

3249
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,350
sometimes you don't. It kind of will
depend. That's the answer.

3250
01:22:59,350 --> 01:22:59,360
depend. That's the answer.
 

3251
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,669
depend. That's the answer.
Uh, last question, but we're actually at

3252
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:01,679
Uh, last question, but we're actually at
 

3253
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:05,910
Uh, last question, but we're actually at
time. So, uh, but go ahead.

3254
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:05,920
time. So, uh, but go ahead.
 

3255
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,910
time. So, uh, but go ahead.

3263
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,910
initializer of the final layer? That's a
really good question. So the finer layer

3264
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:15,920
really good question. So the finer layer
 

3265
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,990
really good question. So the finer layer
can actually be initialized slightly

3266
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:18,000
can actually be initialized slightly
 

3267
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,870
can actually be initialized slightly
differently because you don't have the

3268
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:20,880
differently because you don't have the
 

3269
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,590
differently because you don't have the
issue of the zeroing out of the uh of

3270
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:25,600
issue of the zeroing out of the uh of
 

3271
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,910
issue of the zeroing out of the uh of
the gradient. So if I just think about

3272
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:27,920
the gradient. So if I just think about
 

3273
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,750
the gradient. So if I just think about
this, let's say final linear layer

3274
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:31,760
this, let's say final linear layer
 

3275
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,510
this, let's say final linear layer
here,

3276
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:33,520
here,
 

3277
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,110
here,
because there's only one, you're only

3278
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:35,120
because there's only one, you're only
 

3279
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,669
because there's only one, you're only
one hop from the gradient. As long as

3280
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
one hop from the gradient. As long as
 

3281
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,149
one hop from the gradient. As long as
your inputs here are not zero, you could

3282
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:40,159
your inputs here are not zero, you could
 

3283
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,910
your inputs here are not zero, you could
initialize to this to zero and still be

3284
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:41,920
initialize to this to zero and still be
 

3285
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,669
initialize to this to zero and still be
fine.

3286
01:23:43,669 --> 01:23:43,679
fine.
 

3287
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,310
fine.
But that only is true for the last layer

3288
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
But that only is true for the last layer
 

3289
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,149
But that only is true for the last layer
and not true for everything else.

01:23:50,149 --> 01:23:50,159
and not true for everything else.
 

3291
