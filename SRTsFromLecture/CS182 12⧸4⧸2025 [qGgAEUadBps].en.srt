more for you to explain
 

127

to do that. So, make your poster in a
way that helps you talk. It's not about

And if you have some cool simulation or
 

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,670
And if you have some cool simulation or
some cool plot that looks really great

176

some cool plot that looks really great
 

177
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,189
some cool plot that looks really great
in color and you couldn't print it in

color, bring your laptop, right? Show it
on your laptop. That's also

we going to be graded on the incremental
 

241
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,910
we going to be graded on the incremental
improvement between peer reviews?

242
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
improvement between peer reviews?
 

243
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,750

reviews, right? So, what we care about
 

255
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,150
reviews, right? So, what we care about
the peer reviews is mostly how you

256
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
the peer reviews is mostly how you
 

257
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,150
the peer reviews is mostly how you
yourself did peer reviews as an

258
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
yourself did peer reviews as an
 

259
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,269
yourself did peer reviews as an
individuals because that's the

260
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
individuals because that's the
 

261
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,870
individuals because that's the
multiplicative factor on your project

262
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
multiplicative factor on your project
 

263
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,509
multiplicative factor on your project
grade. So, your report will be graded as

264
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
grade. So, your report will be graded as
 

265
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,070
grade. So, your report will be graded as
a group. that grade will be multiplied

266
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,080
a group. that grade will be multiplied
 

267
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,389
a group. that grade will be multiplied
by your individual grade as at doing a

268
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
by your individual grade as at doing a
 

269
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,750
by your individual grade as at doing a
peer review and that's going to be you

270
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
peer review and that's going to be you
 

271
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,150
peer review and that's going to be you
know so that will be your grade but when

know so that will be your grade but when
 

273
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,910
know so that will be your grade but when
I say the report that includes your part

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
I say the report that includes your part
 

275
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,310
I say the report that includes your part
your uh abilities at the poster session

the right thing should do as many
 

293
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,470
the right thing should do as many
improvements as early as possible

294
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
improvements as early as possible
 

295
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,030
improvements as early as possible
because uh it it's harder to do them

296
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
because uh it it's harder to do them
 

297
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,430
because uh it it's harder to do them
later.

298
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
later.
 

299
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,110

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,550
and so on. But we are telling you right
now it's no notes, no questions, no

322
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
now it's no notes, no questions, no
 

323
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,710
now it's no notes, no questions, no
clarifications. You and your pencil and

324
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
clarifications. You and your pencil and
 

325
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,990
clarifications. You and your pencil and
eraser will be come in. You'll be handed

326
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
eraser will be come in. You'll be handed
 

327
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,509
eraser will be come in. You'll be handed
an exam. There'll be room on there for

328
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
an exam. There'll be room on there for
 

329
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,949
an exam. There'll be room on there for
scratch scratch work. You turn that in.

330
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
scratch scratch work. You turn that in.
 

331
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,509
scratch scratch work. You turn that in.
That's the way it works. Okay. So,

332
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
That's the way it works. Okay. So,
 

333
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,470
That's the way it works. Okay. So,
um as we know you have a lot of stuff to

334
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
um as we know you have a lot of stuff to
 

335
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,790
um as we know you have a lot of stuff to
do next week um just from this class.

336
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
do next week um just from this class.
 

337
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,630
do next week um just from this class.
Um, however, we did want to point out

338
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
Um, however, we did want to point out
 

339
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,790
Um, however, we did want to point out
that there is a really nice EEK

340
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
that there is a really nice EEK
 

341
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,630
that there is a really nice EEK

Dailyaly from Nvidia was also very

364
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
Dailyaly from Nvidia was also very
 

365
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,150
Dailyaly from Nvidia was also very
interesting and if you get a chance you

366
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
interesting and if you get a chance you
 

367
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,350
interesting and if you get a chance you
might want to watch that.

368
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
might want to watch that.
 

369
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,990
might want to watch that.
Uh it's uh it was very interesting to

370
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
Uh it's uh it was very interesting to
 

371
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,269
Uh it's uh it was very interesting to
see the connections between

372
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
see the connections between
 

373
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,470
see the connections between
all of the improvements that are

374
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
all of the improvements that are
 

375
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,230
all of the improvements that are
happening at the hardware level in the

376
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
happening at the hardware level in the
 

377
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,670
happening at the hardware level in the
GPUs and in the racks that hold many

378
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
GPUs and in the racks that hold many
 

379
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,269
GPUs and in the racks that hold many
many GPUs and how that impacts how

380
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
many GPUs and how that impacts how
 

381
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,030
many GPUs and how that impacts how
that's driven by and impacts what's

382
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
that's driven by and impacts what's
 

383
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,949
that's driven by and impacts what's
happening in the architectural side.

384
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
happening in the architectural side.
 

385
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,470
happening in the architectural side.
That's the part of the course that's the

386
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
That's the part of the course that's the
 

387
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,910
That's the part of the course that's the
part of deep learning that we aren't

388
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
part of deep learning that we aren't
 

389
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,990
part of deep learning that we aren't
able to fully engage with for you

390
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
able to fully engage with for you
 

391
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,509
able to fully engage with for you
because we don't have any way for you to

392
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
because we don't have any way for you to
 

393
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,190
because we don't have any way for you to
exercise it um in you know using any

394
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
exercise it um in you know using any
 

395
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,949
exercise it um in you know using any
kind of significant compute but it's

396
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959
kind of significant compute but it's
 

397
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,550
kind of significant compute but it's
quite interesting and I think one of the

398
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
quite interesting and I think one of the
 

399
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,790
quite interesting and I think one of the
things that you'll enjoy uh if you watch

400
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
things that you'll enjoy uh if you watch
 

401
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,030
things that you'll enjoy uh if you watch
it is to see how different things you've

402
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,040
it is to see how different things you've
 

403
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,110
it is to see how different things you've
learned in the class help you understand

404
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
learned in the class help you understand
 

405
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,110
learned in the class help you understand
what's going on uh in that talk.

406
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
what's going on uh in that talk.
 

407
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,110
what's going on uh in that talk.
So and yeah just you know uh I happened

408
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
So and yeah just you know uh I happened
 

409
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,550
So and yeah just you know uh I happened
to be one of the people going out to

410
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
to be one of the people going out to
 

411
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,910
to be one of the people going out to
dinner with him uh yesterday uh after

412
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
dinner with him uh yesterday uh after
 

413
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,910
dinner with him uh yesterday uh after
his talk and it's very interesting in

414
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
his talk and it's very interesting in
 

415
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,069
his talk and it's very interesting in
the conversations to see how many of the

416
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
the conversations to see how many of the
 

417
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,629
the conversations to see how many of the
things that we've talked about how they

418
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
things that we've talked about how they
 

419
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,030
things that we've talked about how they
work inside Nvidia in terms of shaping

420
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
work inside Nvidia in terms of shaping
 

421
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,590
work inside Nvidia in terms of shaping
their work and their uh their their own

422
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
their work and their uh their their own
 

423
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,150
their work and their uh their their own
models as well as their their hardware.

424
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
models as well as their their hardware.
 

425
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,949
models as well as their their hardware.
So it's

426
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
So it's
 

427
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,509
So it's
it's very interesting for you to perhaps

428
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
it's very interesting for you to perhaps
 

429
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,829
it's very interesting for you to perhaps
check that talk out. Not required of

430
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
check that talk out. Not required of
 

431
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,470
check that talk out. Not required of
course. Um

432
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
course. Um
 

433
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,230
course. Um
so uh with that I want to continue on

434
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
so uh with that I want to continue on
 

435
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,590
so uh with that I want to continue on
the material the last set of material

436
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
the material the last set of material
 

437
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,269
the material the last set of material
that I want to cover in the we want to

438
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
that I want to cover in the we want to
 

439
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,350
that I want to cover in the we want to
cover in the class. So again pointing

440
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
cover in the class. So again pointing
 

441
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,230
cover in the class. So again pointing
out there's a in the prince textbook

442
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
out there's a in the prince textbook
 

443
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,710
out there's a in the prince textbook
chapter 18 talks about diffusion we are

444
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
chapter 18 talks about diffusion we are
 

445
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,389
chapter 18 talks about diffusion we are
following in the treatment that we're

446
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
following in the treatment that we're
 

447
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,150
following in the treatment that we're
doing in lecture uh this particular uh

448
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
doing in lecture uh this particular uh
 

449
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,710
doing in lecture uh this particular uh
archive uh paper that came out last year

450
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
archive uh paper that came out last year
 

451
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,870
archive uh paper that came out last year
that really is quite clear and you saw

452
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
that really is quite clear and you saw
 

453
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,910
that really is quite clear and you saw
in discussion uh something that

454
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
in discussion uh something that
 

455
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,509
in discussion uh something that
hopefully helped you understand what was

456
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
hopefully helped you understand what was
 

457
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,949
hopefully helped you understand what was
going on in a much simplified context.

458
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
going on in a much simplified context.
 

459
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,829
going on in a much simplified context.
So it's a really the discussion example

460
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
So it's a really the discussion example
 

461
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,069
So it's a really the discussion example
was let's just do everything in a purely

462
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
was let's just do everything in a purely
 

463
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,629
was let's just do everything in a purely
discrete world. We just thinking about

464
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
discrete world. We just thinking about
 

465
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,350
discrete world. We just thinking about
coin tosses and you saw in there what

466
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
coin tosses and you saw in there what
 

467
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,710
coin tosses and you saw in there what
was happening as you took an image and

468
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
was happening as you took an image and
 

469
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,790
was happening as you took an image and
made it noisier and noisier by flipping

470
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
made it noisier and noisier by flipping
 

471
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,150
made it noisier and noisier by flipping
the bits, you know, black and white

472
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
the bits, you know, black and white
 

473
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,829
the bits, you know, black and white
image and how you can then think about

474
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
image and how you can then think about
 

475
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,110
image and how you can then think about
what you want to predict. And it was we

476
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
what you want to predict. And it was we
 

477
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,470
what you want to predict. And it was we
really wanted you to see there is that

478
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
really wanted you to see there is that
 

479
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,710
really wanted you to see there is that
you can also think about it as not just

480
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
you can also think about it as not just
 

481
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,150
you can also think about it as not just
predicting the last thing you came from

482
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
predicting the last thing you came from
 

483
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,550
predicting the last thing you came from
but as predicting the original image.

484
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
but as predicting the original image.
 

485
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,509
but as predicting the original image.
You can see the connection between

486
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
You can see the connection between
 

487
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,710
You can see the connection between
predicting the original image and

488
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
predicting the original image and
 

489
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,069
predicting the original image and
predicting the last thing. We'll come

490
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
predicting the last thing. We'll come
 

491
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,829
predicting the last thing. We'll come
back to that today in the Gaussian

492
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:31,839
back to that today in the Gaussian
 

493
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,189
back to that today in the Gaussian
setting. So you can see the same ideas

494
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
setting. So you can see the same ideas
 

495
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,150
setting. So you can see the same ideas
here. Um in that you saw the use of KL

496
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,160
here. Um in that you saw the use of KL
 

497
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,670
here. Um in that you saw the use of KL
divergence as a natural loss that you

498
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680
divergence as a natural loss that you
 

499
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,750
divergence as a natural loss that you
want to minimize. If you want to think

500
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
want to minimize. If you want to think
 

501
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,069
want to minimize. If you want to think
about it, it's a useful heristic to

502
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
about it, it's a useful heristic to
 

503
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,110
about it, it's a useful heristic to
think let me think about Gaussians

504
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
think let me think about Gaussians
 

505
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,949
think let me think about Gaussians
first. Always think about Gaussians and

506
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
first. Always think about Gaussians and
 

507
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,710
first. Always think about Gaussians and
mean squared error like that's you're

508
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
mean squared error like that's you're
 

509
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,069
mean squared error like that's you're
anchored there. You've seen that in your

510
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
anchored there. You've seen that in your
 

511
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,430
anchored there. You've seen that in your
optimization classes. You saw that in

512
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
optimization classes. You saw that in
 

513
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,790
optimization classes. You saw that in
machine learning classes. You've seen we

514
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
machine learning classes. You've seen we
 

515
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,590
machine learning classes. You've seen we
use that for examples here. And then ask

516
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
use that for examples here. And then ask
 

517
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,189
use that for examples here. And then ask
I want something like squared error for

518
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:03,199
I want something like squared error for
 

519
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,269
I want something like squared error for
this other domain for which squared

520
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
this other domain for which squared
 

521
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,269
this other domain for which squared
error is not the right thing. And the

522
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
error is not the right thing. And the
 

523
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,389
error is not the right thing. And the
answer is usually KL divergence

524
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
answer is usually KL divergence
 

525
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,189
answer is usually KL divergence
as the kind of counterpart.

526
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
as the kind of counterpart.
 

527
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,069
as the kind of counterpart.
Um so and you saw that for example in

528
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
Um so and you saw that for example in
 

529
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,590
Um so and you saw that for example in
yeah that's what we you saw in the

530
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
yeah that's what we you saw in the
 

531
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,150
yeah that's what we you saw in the
discussion. Okay so let's uh begin uh

532
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
discussion. Okay so let's uh begin uh
 

533
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,230
discussion. Okay so let's uh begin uh
quickly recap where we were. So the idea

534
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,240
quickly recap where we were. So the idea
 

535
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,230
quickly recap where we were. So the idea
is we want to be able to generate

536
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
is we want to be able to generate
 

537
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,069
is we want to be able to generate
something like an image and the natural

538
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:32,079
something like an image and the natural
 

539
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,590
something like an image and the natural
approaches of trying to do it with a

540
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
approaches of trying to do it with a
 

541
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,990
approaches of trying to do it with a
single shot suffers issues like we

542
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
single shot suffers issues like we
 

543
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,750
single shot suffers issues like we
talked about with baes using this

544
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:37,760
talked about with baes using this
 

545
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,670
talked about with baes using this
classifier idea and going gradient

546
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
classifier idea and going gradient
 

547
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,670
classifier idea and going gradient
descent doesn't really work. So the

548
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
descent doesn't really work. So the
 

549
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,230
descent doesn't really work. So the
problem is that images are very thin in

550
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
problem is that images are very thin in
 

551
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,150
problem is that images are very thin in
the set of all images. The images you

552
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,160
the set of all images. The images you
 

553
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,749
the set of all images. The images you
care about are very very thin. So you

554
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:49,759
care about are very very thin. So you
 

555
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,829
care about are very very thin. So you
want to like use make them noisier to

556
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
want to like use make them noisier to
 

557
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,990
want to like use make them noisier to
see to learn how to actually move around

558
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
see to learn how to actually move around
 

559
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,509
see to learn how to actually move around
this large space because if you just

560
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
this large space because if you just
 

561
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,030
this large space because if you just
look at natural images you can't learn

562
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
look at natural images you can't learn
 

563
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,389
look at natural images you can't learn
how to navigate in this larger space. So

564
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
how to navigate in this larger space. So
 

565
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,550
how to navigate in this larger space. So
we said that was the insight from the VA

566
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
we said that was the insight from the VA
 

567
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,710
we said that was the insight from the VA
story and we said well why don't we just

568
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
story and we said well why don't we just
 

569
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,749
story and we said well why don't we just
as an idea look at all levels of noisy

570
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
as an idea look at all levels of noisy
 

571
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,389
as an idea look at all levels of noisy
images because as we make noise images

572
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
images because as we make noise images
 

573
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,230
images because as we make noise images
increasingly noisy will eventually fill

574
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
increasingly noisy will eventually fill
 

575
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,910
increasingly noisy will eventually fill
up the entire space that we want to

576
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
up the entire space that we want to
 

577
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,590
up the entire space that we want to
build a navigate in. This is a

578
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
build a navigate in. This is a
 

579
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,550
build a navigate in. This is a
perspective that one could take.

580
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
perspective that one could take.
 

581
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,749
perspective that one could take.
And the perspective was so somehow

582
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
And the perspective was so somehow
 

583
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,910
And the perspective was so somehow
during training we're going to train

584
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
during training we're going to train
 

585
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,430
during training we're going to train
this thing with increasingly noisy

586
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
this thing with increasingly noisy
 

587
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,310
this thing with increasingly noisy
images. But what we want to do is to be

588
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
images. But what we want to do is to be
 

589
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,990
images. But what we want to do is to be
able to start at noise and generate an

590
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,000
able to start at noise and generate an
 

591
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,829
able to start at noise and generate an
image somehow. That's our goal and we'll

592
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
image somehow. That's our goal and we'll
 

593
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,990
image somehow. That's our goal and we'll
take many steps. And the whole point was

594
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
take many steps. And the whole point was
 

595
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,870
take many steps. And the whole point was
to figure out how to do this.

596
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
to figure out how to do this.
 

597
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,790
to figure out how to do this.
So

598
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
So
 

599
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,150
So
remember last time we connected this to

600
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
remember last time we connected this to
 

601
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,310
remember last time we connected this to
the idea of diffusion to the name of if

602
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,320
the idea of diffusion to the name of if
 

603
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,629
the idea of diffusion to the name of if
you thought about the process of

604
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:48,639
you thought about the process of
 

605
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,749
you thought about the process of
diffusion as there's a tiny amount of

606
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
diffusion as there's a tiny amount of
 

607
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,069
diffusion as there's a tiny amount of
red dye injected into a glass and you

608
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
red dye injected into a glass and you
 

609
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,990
red dye injected into a glass and you
watch it diffuse into the entire glass

610
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
watch it diffuse into the entire glass
 

611
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,509
watch it diffuse into the entire glass
and the idea is this is natural images.

612
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
and the idea is this is natural images.
 

613
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,189
and the idea is this is natural images.
The diffusion out is the making them

614
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
The diffusion out is the making them
 

615
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,189
The diffusion out is the making them
noisier and noisier. And the reverse

616
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
noisier and noisier. And the reverse
 

617
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,549
noisier and noisier. And the reverse
process going to run that movie in

618
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
process going to run that movie in
 

619
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,949
process going to run that movie in
reverse to take a particular piece of

620
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
reverse to take a particular piece of
 

621
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,590
reverse to take a particular piece of
dye that we find out here and then

622
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
dye that we find out here and then
 

623
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,110
dye that we find out here and then
follow it back in some distributional

624
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,120
follow it back in some distributional
 

625
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,110
follow it back in some distributional
sense back to where it was on the

626
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
sense back to where it was on the
 

627
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,990
sense back to where it was on the
original set of images. That was the

628
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,000
original set of images. That was the
 

629
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,789
original set of images. That was the
want to run a diffusion in reverse.

630
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799

 

631
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,710

So we said okay this is the set the

632
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
So we said okay this is the set the
 

633
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,390
So we said okay this is the set the
setting that we have. Any questions on

634
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
setting that we have. Any questions on
 

635
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,549
setting that we have. Any questions on
the setting?

636
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
the setting?
 

637
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,510
the setting?
Okay, setting is clear. Now, we

638
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
Okay, setting is clear. Now, we
 

639
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,270
Okay, setting is clear. Now, we
mentioned and today I wanted to hit both

640
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
mentioned and today I wanted to hit both
 

641
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,950
mentioned and today I wanted to hit both
of these that there's two different

642
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:36,960
of these that there's two different
 

643
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,110
of these that there's two different
approaches to do the backward path. The

644
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
approaches to do the backward path. The
 

645
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,230
approaches to do the backward path. The
one we're going to start with and the

646
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
one we're going to start with and the
 

647
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,590
one we're going to start with and the
one that you really need to understand

648
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
one that you really need to understand
 

649
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,270
one that you really need to understand
quite well is the natural one of having

650
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
quite well is the natural one of having
 

651
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,029
quite well is the natural one of having
randomness on the backward path. We're

652
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
randomness on the backward path. We're
 

653
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,390
randomness on the backward path. We're
then going to talk about how you can

654
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
then going to talk about how you can
 

655
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,750
then going to talk about how you can
even do it without randomness on the

656
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
even do it without randomness on the
 

657
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,950
even do it without randomness on the
backward path. But that's a little bit

658
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
backward path. But that's a little bit
 

659
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,029
backward path. But that's a little bit
more intellectually

660
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
more intellectually
 

661
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,789
more intellectually
uh there's a bit of a leaps involved

662
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
uh there's a bit of a leaps involved
 

663
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,909
uh there's a bit of a leaps involved
intellectually to do that.

664
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919
intellectually to do that.
 

665
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,950
intellectually to do that.
So we want to do this. We want to

666
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:00,960
So we want to do this. We want to
 

667
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,029
So we want to do this. We want to
simulate the process going backward. Now

668
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:03,039
simulate the process going backward. Now
 

669
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,950
simulate the process going backward. Now
this is important.

670
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
this is important.
 

671
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,510
this is important.
We don't expect when we simulate the

672
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
We don't expect when we simulate the
 

673
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,430
We don't expect when we simulate the
process going backward, we will end up

674
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
process going backward, we will end up
 

675
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,470
process going backward, we will end up
at the same place we did going forward.

676
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
at the same place we did going forward.
 

677
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,630
at the same place we did going forward.
This is because we're simulating a

678
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
This is because we're simulating a
 

679
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,470
This is because we're simulating a
random process going backward and so

680
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
random process going backward and so
 

681
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,510
random process going backward and so
there's going to be randomness in it.

682
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
there's going to be randomness in it.
 

683
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,510
there's going to be randomness in it.
So we reminded you of this using a

684
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
So we reminded you of this using a
 

685
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,430
So we reminded you of this using a
markup chain to help anchor your

686
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
markup chain to help anchor your
 

687
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,070
markup chain to help anchor your
intuition. The example from discussion

688
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
intuition. The example from discussion
 

689
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,710
intuition. The example from discussion
is another example like that. So that

690
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
is another example like that. So that
 

691
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,630
is another example like that. So that
was also a kind of markoff chain right

692
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
was also a kind of markoff chain right
 

693
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,630
was also a kind of markoff chain right
for every pixel where every pixel was

694
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
for every pixel where every pixel was
 

695
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,950
for every pixel where every pixel was
being flipped. A two-state markoff chain

696
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
being flipped. A two-state markoff chain
 

697
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,630
being flipped. A two-state markoff chain
if you want to think of it that way.

698
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
if you want to think of it that way.
 

699
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,630
if you want to think of it that way.
Um

700
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
Um
 

701
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,950
Um
okay so next we said okay

702
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960

 

703
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,590

we're going to add Gaussian noise in the

704
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
we're going to add Gaussian noise in the
 

705
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,750
we're going to add Gaussian noise in the
way that we go forward. That's how we're

706
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
way that we go forward. That's how we're
 

707
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,669
way that we go forward. That's how we're
going to make things noisier by adding

708
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
going to make things noisier by adding
 

709
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,029
going to make things noisier by adding
straight up adding Gaussian noise

710
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
straight up adding Gaussian noise
 

711
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,669
straight up adding Gaussian noise
independent every time.

712
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
independent every time.
 

713
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,830
independent every time.
And we want to understand what does the

714
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
And we want to understand what does the
 

715
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,110
And we want to understand what does the
backward distribution look like. Okay?

716
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
backward distribution look like. Okay?
 

717
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,310
backward distribution look like. Okay?
Because that's we need to be able to

718
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
Because that's we need to be able to
 

719
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,870
Because that's we need to be able to
walk on the backward distribution.

720
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:06,880
walk on the backward distribution.
 

721
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,590
walk on the backward distribution.
And the question was we really really

722
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:09,600
And the question was we really really
 

723
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,470
And the question was we really really
wish it were a Gaussian. Why? Because we

724
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
wish it were a Gaussian. Why? Because we
 

725
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,990
wish it were a Gaussian. Why? Because we
like Gaussians. We know how to sample

726
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
like Gaussians. We know how to sample
 

727
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,870
like Gaussians. We know how to sample
from them. And the question is is it?

728
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
from them. And the question is is it?
 

729
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,630
from them. And the question is is it?
And we asserted. Today I'm going to walk

730
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,640
And we asserted. Today I'm going to walk
 

731
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,070
And we asserted. Today I'm going to walk
you through an argument for it and the

732
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
you through an argument for it and the
 

733
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,789
you through an argument for it and the
homework makes you do it explicitly in a

734
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:24,799
homework makes you do it explicitly in a
 

735
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,990
homework makes you do it explicitly in a
different setting than the one I'm going

736
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
different setting than the one I'm going
 

737
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,710
different setting than the one I'm going
to do. Um

738
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
to do. Um
 

739
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,870
to do. Um
so

740
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
so
 

741
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,990
so
it turns out that if the whatever the

742
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
it turns out that if the whatever the
 

743
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,510
it turns out that if the whatever the
underlying distribution is that

744
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
underlying distribution is that
 

745
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,590
underlying distribution is that
generated X0 so there's some P of X0

746
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
generated X0 so there's some P of X0
 

747
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,870
generated X0 so there's some P of X0
which is unknown to us we only have

748
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
which is unknown to us we only have
 

749
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,070
which is unknown to us we only have
samples from it but if it's sufficiently

750
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080
samples from it but if it's sufficiently
 

751
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,270
samples from it but if it's sufficiently
smooth if the amount of noise we add is

752
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
smooth if the amount of noise we add is
 

753
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,390
smooth if the amount of noise we add is
small enough that it turns out that the

754
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
small enough that it turns out that the
 

755
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,830
small enough that it turns out that the
conditional probability going in the

756
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
conditional probability going in the
 

757
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,070
conditional probability going in the
opposite direction is approximately

758
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
opposite direction is approximately
 

759
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,310
opposite direction is approximately
Gaussian

760
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:54,320
Gaussian
 

761
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,870
Gaussian
in that there's a mean term which

762
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
in that there's a mean term which
 

763
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,950
in that there's a mean term which
depends on where you are in the future.

764
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
depends on where you are in the future.
 

765
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,710
depends on where you are in the future.
But the noise term going backwards is

766
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:04,720
But the noise term going backwards is
 

767
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,070
But the noise term going backwards is
just sigma squ as the one noise going in

768
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
just sigma squ as the one noise going in
 

769
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,549
just sigma squ as the one noise going in
the forward direction. And it's

770
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
the forward direction. And it's
 

771
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,590
the forward direction. And it's
gaussium. Okay. So this I'm going to uh

772
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
gaussium. Okay. So this I'm going to uh
 

773
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,029
gaussium. Okay. So this I'm going to uh
come back to and show you a kind of a

774
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:19,039
come back to and show you a kind of a
 

775
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,430
come back to and show you a kind of a
handwavy argument from I'll copy it from

776
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440
handwavy argument from I'll copy it from
 

777
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,350
handwavy argument from I'll copy it from
the paper uh and kind of walk you

778
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,360
the paper uh and kind of walk you
 

779
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,950
the paper uh and kind of walk you
through the steps of it that asserts why

780
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
through the steps of it that asserts why
 

781
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,870
through the steps of it that asserts why
this approximation can hold. The paper

782
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:26,880
this approximation can hold. The paper
 

783
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,310
this approximation can hold. The paper
itself in the appendix has a more uh

784
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
itself in the appendix has a more uh
 

785
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,149
itself in the appendix has a more uh
kind of cleaned up rigorous version of

786
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:32,159
kind of cleaned up rigorous version of
 

787
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,789
kind of cleaned up rigorous version of
that argument and the homework makes you

788
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
that argument and the homework makes you
 

789
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,950
that argument and the homework makes you
do it in a special case which is

790
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
do it in a special case which is
 

791
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,909
do it in a special case which is
interesting of a Gaussian. Okay. To see

792
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
interesting of a Gaussian. Okay. To see
 

793
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,870
interesting of a Gaussian. Okay. To see
what's what's happening there

794
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880
what's what's happening there
 

795
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,029
what's what's happening there
because the at some level the fact that

796
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039
because the at some level the fact that
 

797
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,549
because the at some level the fact that
it's Gaussian this argument will kind of

798
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
it's Gaussian this argument will kind of
 

799
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,549
it's Gaussian this argument will kind of
convince you of approximately but the

800
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
convince you of approximately but the
 

801
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,310
convince you of approximately but the
fact that this variance is actually the

802
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
fact that this variance is actually the
 

803
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,470
fact that this variance is actually the
same you might think wait does that

804
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:52,480
same you might think wait does that
 

805
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,029
same you might think wait does that
really very does that really hold and

806
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
really very does that really hold and
 

807
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,110
really very does that really hold and
the the homework will hopefully help you

808
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
the the homework will hopefully help you
 

809
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,149
the the homework will hopefully help you
understand that better.

810
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159
understand that better.
 

811
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,070
understand that better.
Okay. So

812
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080

 

813
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,830

I will I don't want I'll talk about this

814
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
I will I don't want I'll talk about this
 

815
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,029
I will I don't want I'll talk about this
later, but one thing that's very helpful

816
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
later, but one thing that's very helpful
 

817
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,950
later, but one thing that's very helpful
whenever you have something that's going

818
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
whenever you have something that's going
 

819
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,630
whenever you have something that's going
to depend on something being small

820
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:12,640
to depend on something being small
 

821
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,789
to depend on something being small
enough, you're going to in your mind,

822
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,799
enough, you're going to in your mind,
 

823
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,390
enough, you're going to in your mind,
you say maybe I'm going to think about

824
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
you say maybe I'm going to think about
 

825
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,789
you say maybe I'm going to think about
this as some limit of something going to

826
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799
this as some limit of something going to
 

827
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,390
this as some limit of something going to
zero. And in this setting, it's natural

828
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
zero. And in this setting, it's natural
 

829
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,270
zero. And in this setting, it's natural
to take a continuous time perspective

830
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,280
to take a continuous time perspective
 

831
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,669
to take a continuous time perspective
where you're evolving something from

832
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679
where you're evolving something from
 

833
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,830
where you're evolving something from
time zero to time one. and you make the

834
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:31,840
time zero to time one. and you make the
 

835
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,630
time zero to time one. and you make the
time steps get smaller and smaller as a

836
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
time steps get smaller and smaller as a
 

837
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,710
time steps get smaller and smaller as a
way of kind of thinking about this. So

838
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
way of kind of thinking about this. So
 

839
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,870
way of kind of thinking about this. So
we take a continuous time perspective.

840
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:38,880
we take a continuous time perspective.
 

841
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,470
we take a continuous time perspective.
We're just going to think of it instead

842
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,480
We're just going to think of it instead
 

843
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,789
We're just going to think of it instead
of as x of 1 x of 2 x of 3 as x of zero

844
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799
of as x of 1 x of 2 x of 3 as x of zero
 

845
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,669
of as x of 1 x of 2 x of 3 as x of zero
x of delta t x of 2 delta t x of 3 delta

846
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
x of delta t x of 2 delta t x of 3 delta
 

847
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,470
x of delta t x of 2 delta t x of 3 delta
t all the way up to x of 1. And we're

848
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
t all the way up to x of 1. And we're
 

849
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,909
t all the way up to x of 1. And we're
going to think of the noise we add at

850
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
going to think of the noise we add at
 

851
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,270
going to think of the noise we add at
every step as being some new sigma squ

852
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
every step as being some new sigma squ
 

853
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,470
every step as being some new sigma squ
time delta t. So sigma square is is

854
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,480
time delta t. So sigma square is is
 

855
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,830
time delta t. So sigma square is is
think of sigma square as being a very

856
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
think of sigma square as being a very
 

857
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,149
think of sigma square as being a very
big number and think of delta t as being

858
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
big number and think of delta t as being
 

859
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,710
big number and think of delta t as being
a very tiny number such that the product

860
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
a very tiny number such that the product
 

861
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,630
a very tiny number such that the product
of this very big number and this very

862
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
of this very big number and this very
 

863
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,149
of this very big number and this very
tiny number is itself tiny.

864
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
tiny number is itself tiny.
 

865
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,950
tiny number is itself tiny.
Okay, that's the way to think of it.

866
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
Okay, that's the way to think of it.
 

867
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,630
Okay, that's the way to think of it.
So intuition

868
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,640

 

869
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,909

big

870
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919

 

871
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:28,470

tiny

872
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480

 

873
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,630

very small

874
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,640

 

875
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,310

very small amounts of noise we're adding

876
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
very small amounts of noise we're adding
 

877
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,830
very small amounts of noise we're adding
at every step.

878
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:37,840

 

879
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,390

Okay, so if we knew that

880
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,400
Okay, so if we knew that
 

881
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,909
Okay, so if we knew that
this distribution has some mean and a

882
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:45,919
this distribution has some mean and a
 

883
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,909
this distribution has some mean and a
known variance, the mean is a thing we

884
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:47,919
known variance, the mean is a thing we
 

885
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,470
known variance, the mean is a thing we
have to learn from the data. So we'll

886
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:50,480
have to learn from the data. So we'll
 

887
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,830
have to learn from the data. So we'll
talk about how we learn from data in a

888
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
talk about how we learn from data in a
 

889
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,430
talk about how we learn from data in a
moment but just for now think that we've

890
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,440
moment but just for now think that we've
 

891
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,909
moment but just for now think that we've
learned it from the data. So this is the

892
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
learned it from the data. So this is the
 

893
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,909
learned it from the data. So this is the
thing that our neural net is doing. Our

894
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:57,919
thing that our neural net is doing. Our
 

895
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,950
thing that our neural net is doing. Our
neural net is has some parameters theta

896
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
neural net is has some parameters theta
 

897
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,710
neural net is has some parameters theta
they're being learned and they are

898
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:02,720
they're being learned and they are
 

899
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,590
they're being learned and they are
telling us what this mean is.

900
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:05,600
telling us what this mean is.
 

901
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,029
telling us what this mean is.
Okay. Now we've done this in the forward

902
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:09,039
Okay. Now we've done this in the forward
 

903
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,390
Okay. Now we've done this in the forward
by looking at the forward diffusion.

904
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
by looking at the forward diffusion.
 

905
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,710
by looking at the forward diffusion.
Somehow we've learned what this is. We

906
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:12,720
Somehow we've learned what this is. We
 

907
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,110
Somehow we've learned what this is. We
have to use this to do generation. How

908
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,120
have to use this to do generation. How
 

909
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,909
have to use this to do generation. How
can we use this to do generation? Well,

910
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:17,919
can we use this to do generation? Well,
 

911
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,710
can we use this to do generation? Well,
the idea is

912
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,720
the idea is
 

913
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,990
the idea is
we have a way now because we have a an

914
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
we have a way now because we have a an
 

915
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,310
we have a way now because we have a an
explicit expression in terms of a

916
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
explicit expression in terms of a
 

917
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,350
explicit expression in terms of a
density for how to go backward one step

918
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
density for how to go backward one step
 

919
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,149
density for how to go backward one step
namely sample from this Gaussian. So we

920
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:32,159
namely sample from this Gaussian. So we
 

921
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,870
namely sample from this Gaussian. So we
just run this process. We just evolve

922
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:34,880
just run this process. We just evolve
 

923
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,029
just run this process. We just evolve
this process. So what do we do?

924
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039

 

925
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,270

How do you evolve this process? Let me

926
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,280
How do you evolve this process? Let me
 

927
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,789
How do you evolve this process? Let me
just scroll down a little bit so they

928
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
just scroll down a little bit so they
 

929
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,149
just scroll down a little bit so they
both are visible.

930
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:48,159

 

931
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,149

you take you generate your first one. So

932
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:50,159
you take you generate your first one. So
 

933
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,149
you take you generate your first one. So
I should write that first.

934
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159

 

935
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:03,430

So first

936
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440

 

937
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,470

draw

938
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480

x hat not zero sorry one the last one as

you want to think of it is it's
 

953
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,549
you want to think of it is it's
insignificant compared to how big sigma

954
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
insignificant compared to how big sigma
 

955
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,630
insignificant compared to how big sigma
square is. So we can just draw from

956
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
square is. So we can just draw from
 

957
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,110
square is. So we can just draw from
normal zero sigma square to as the

958
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,120
normal zero sigma square to as the
 

959
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,190
normal zero sigma square to as the
ending point. This is the counterpart of

960
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
ending point. This is the counterpart of
 

961
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,470
ending point. This is the counterpart of
drawing a uniform uniformly in the glass

962
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:40,480
drawing a uniform uniformly in the glass
 

963
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,310
drawing a uniform uniformly in the glass
a position uniformly in the glass of

964
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:42,320
a position uniformly in the glass of
 

965
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,430
a position uniformly in the glass of
water. Okay, that's what this is. And

966
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,440
water. Okay, that's what this is. And
 

967
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,070
water. Okay, that's what this is. And
now we want to go backwards. So we have

968
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,080
now we want to go backwards. So we have
 

969
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,149
now we want to go backwards. So we have
it as a Gaussian. So explicitly what you

970
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
it as a Gaussian. So explicitly what you
 

971
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,070
it as a Gaussian. So explicitly what you
do is you just say I run my learn

972
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
do is you just say I run my learn
 

973
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,190
do is you just say I run my learn
network on this x hat t

974
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
network on this x hat t
 

975
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,310
network on this x hat t
and then I add gaussian noise to it.

976
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,320
and then I add gaussian noise to it.
 

977
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,310
and then I add gaussian noise to it.
Right? That's how you get a gaussian

978
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
Right? That's how you get a gaussian
 

979
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,190
Right? That's how you get a gaussian
with a known mean. You draw you you take

980
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
with a known mean. You draw you you take
 

981
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,870
with a known mean. You draw you you take
the mean and you draw a zero mean

982
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
the mean and you draw a zero mean
 

983
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,149
the mean and you draw a zero mean
gaussian with the variance you want. And

984
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
gaussian with the variance you want. And
 

985
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,590
gaussian with the variance you want. And
now I've moved back one step.

986
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
now I've moved back one step.
 

987
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,870
now I've moved back one step.
Now I take the thing that's moved back

988
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880
Now I take the thing that's moved back
 

989
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,149
Now I take the thing that's moved back
one step. I recmp compute a new mean

990
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
one step. I recmp compute a new mean
 

991
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,149
one step. I recmp compute a new mean
that tells me a particular direction and

992
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:22,159
that tells me a particular direction and
 

993
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,590
that tells me a particular direction and
distance to move. I move that much. I go

994
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:25,600
distance to move. I move that much. I go
 

995
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,430
distance to move. I move that much. I go
I go to that position specifically jump

996
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440
I go to that position specifically jump
 

997
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,029
I go to that position specifically jump
to that position and then I add noise to

998
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
to that position and then I add noise to
 

999
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,950
to that position and then I add noise to
it and I keep doing this process over

it and I keep doing this process over
 

1001
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,870

Okay. Any questions on how what this

1027

it sigma squared q but it doesn't matter

1035
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,430

right so you'll see some sigma squared
 

1037

the markoff chain going backward. It

1108
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,000
the markoff chain going backward. It
 

1109
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,149
the markoff chain going backward. It
becomes a time varying markoff chain

1110
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:48,159
becomes a time varying markoff chain
 

1111
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,310
becomes a time varying markoff chain
that has randomness still in it.

1112
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,320
that has randomness still in it.
 

1113
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,310
that has randomness still in it.
So that's why we're adding noise.

1114
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:54,320
So that's why we're adding noise.
 

1115
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,430
So that's why we're adding noise.
>> Yeah.

1116
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:57,440

 

1117
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,870

>> So I've not talked about how we train

1118
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,880
>> So I've not talked about how we train
 

1119
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,630
>> So I've not talked about how we train
mu. I will talk about training mu in a

1120
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
mu. I will talk about training mu in a
 

1121
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,149
mu. I will talk about training mu in a
moment because right now I'm just saying

1122
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:02,159
moment because right now I'm just saying
 

1123
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,310
moment because right now I'm just saying
that somehow from data we're going to

1124
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,320
that somehow from data we're going to
 

1125
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,230
that somehow from data we're going to
learn what this uh mu is. Okay we'll in

1126
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,240
learn what this uh mu is. Okay we'll in
 

1127
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,549
learn what this uh mu is. Okay we'll in
a moment we'll talk about it but uh

1128
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:10,559
a moment we'll talk about it but uh
 

1129
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,630
a moment we'll talk about it but uh
let's just leave it for now. It'll turn

1130
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:12,640
let's just leave it for now. It'll turn
 

1131
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,389
let's just leave it for now. It'll turn
out the loss we'll use is just in this

1132
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399
out the loss we'll use is just in this
 

1133
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,430
out the loss we'll use is just in this
particular case is just going to be

1134
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
particular case is just going to be
 

1135
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,230
particular case is just going to be
squared error. Okay. But uh here we're

1136
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
squared error. Okay. But uh here we're
 

1137
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,830
squared error. Okay. But uh here we're
just putting that aside. We have

1138
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,840
just putting that aside. We have
 

1139
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,230
just putting that aside. We have
so from an intuitive point of view it's

1140
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,240
so from an intuitive point of view it's
 

1141
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,350
so from an intuitive point of view it's
like

1142
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,360

 

1143
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,430

learning the mean of a Gaussian

1144
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,440
learning the mean of a Gaussian
 

1145
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,870
learning the mean of a Gaussian
where you have uh some input Z

1146
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
where you have uh some input Z
 

1147
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,070
where you have uh some input Z
and then you get to observe versions of

1148
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
and then you get to observe versions of
 

1149
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,389
and then you get to observe versions of
samples from that Gaussian. That's a

1150
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:44,399
samples from that Gaussian. That's a
 

1151
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,630
samples from that Gaussian. That's a
regression problem. That's like the

1152
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
regression problem. That's like the
 

1153
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,149
regression problem. That's like the
prototypical remember we talked about

1154
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
prototypical remember we talked about
 

1155
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,149
prototypical remember we talked about
the map MLE versions of le squares at

1156
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
the map MLE versions of le squares at
 

1157
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,430
the map MLE versions of le squares at
the very beginning one of the first

1158
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:53,440
the very beginning one of the first
 

1159
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,710
the very beginning one of the first
homeworks it's just that

1160
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:56,720
homeworks it's just that
 

1161
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,470
homeworks it's just that
so we know how to do that that's just

1162
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
so we know how to do that that's just
 

1163
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,070
so we know how to do that that's just
regression but we can come back we'll

1164
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
regression but we can come back we'll
 

1165
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,669
regression but we can come back we'll
come back to it in a moment

1166
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:03,679
come back to it in a moment
 

1167
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,269
come back to it in a moment
so any qu other questions on this

1168
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:05,279
so any qu other questions on this
 

1169
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,430
so any qu other questions on this
generation process how the generation

1170
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,440
generation process how the generation
 

1171
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,430
generation process how the generation
works

1172
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,440
works
 

1173
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,389
works
okay so now this we talked about this

1174
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:12,399
okay so now this we talked about this
 

1175
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,350
okay so now this we talked about this
last time this is the way that we're

1176
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360
last time this is the way that we're
 

1177
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,789
last time this is the way that we're
going to do the generation let's go back

1178
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
going to do the generation let's go back
 

1179
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,590
going to do the generation let's go back
and revisit this claim. Okay, the claim

1180
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:17,600
and revisit this claim. Okay, the claim
 

1181
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,190
and revisit this claim. Okay, the claim
was that the backward thing is Gaussian.

1182
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,200
was that the backward thing is Gaussian.
 

1183
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,350
was that the backward thing is Gaussian.
Let's try to see why that might be true.

1184
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,360
Let's try to see why that might be true.
 

1185
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,430
Let's try to see why that might be true.
So here I'm just quoting the claim from

1186
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
So here I'm just quoting the claim from
 

1187
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,070
So here I'm just quoting the claim from
the paper. And this is a little bit of

1188
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,080
the paper. And this is a little bit of
 

1189
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,430
the paper. And this is a little bit of
the notation here to say let's assume

1190
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
the notation here to say let's assume
 

1191
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,510
the notation here to say let's assume
that we have some density that's

1192
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,520
that we have some density that's
 

1193
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,269
that we have some density that's
sufficiently smooth because we're going

1194
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:35,279
sufficiently smooth because we're going
 

1195
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,070
sufficiently smooth because we're going
to hand wave here some things. So enough

1196
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
to hand wave here some things. So enough
 

1197
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,750
to hand wave here some things. So enough
smoothness so that tailor expansions and

1198
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:39,760
smoothness so that tailor expansions and
 

1199
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,549
smoothness so that tailor expansions and
the like will all work. And let's look

1200
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:42,559
the like will all work. And let's look
 

1201
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,430
the like will all work. And let's look
at the joint distribution for one step.

1202
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
at the joint distribution for one step.
 

1203
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,789
at the joint distribution for one step.
And now

1204
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:50,799

 

1205
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,230

so this is just describing what we just

1206
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,240
so this is just describing what we just
 

1207
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,029
so this is just describing what we just
did. Okay. So here we take the thing we

1208
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,039
did. Okay. So here we take the thing we
 

1209
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,470
did. Okay. So here we take the thing we
add noise. That's the way we go forward.

1210
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:58,480
add noise. That's the way we go forward.
 

1211
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,909
add noise. That's the way we go forward.
Then as long as delta t is small enough,

1212
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:01,919
Then as long as delta t is small enough,
 

1213
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,389
Then as long as delta t is small enough,
there's going to be a mean

1214
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
there's going to be a mean
 

1215
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,950
there's going to be a mean
and a variance such that the

1216
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
and a variance such that the
 

1217
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,830
and a variance such that the
distribution conditional of xt minus

1218
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
distribution conditional of xt minus
 

1219
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,029
distribution conditional of xt minus
delta t given that xt is something is

1220
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:13,039
delta t given that xt is something is
 

1221
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,389
delta t given that xt is something is
gaussian. That's what this notation

1222
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
gaussian. That's what this notation
 

1223
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,230
gaussian. That's what this notation
means. Right? I would have written it

1224
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,240
means. Right? I would have written it
 

1225
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,950
means. Right? I would have written it
without this thing here. Right? This

1226
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:18,960
without this thing here. Right? This
 

1227
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,990
without this thing here. Right? This
probability is a gaussian. But

1228
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
probability is a gaussian. But
 

1229
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,830
probability is a gaussian. But
this just saying gaussian what's

1230
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:23,840
this just saying gaussian what's
 

1231
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,750
this just saying gaussian what's
gaussian? This is gaussian. What's its

1232
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:25,760
gaussian? This is gaussian. What's its
 

1233
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,190
gaussian? This is gaussian. What's its
mean? This is its mean. What's it

1234
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,200
mean? This is its mean. What's it
 

1235
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,990
mean? This is its mean. What's it
variance? This is the variance.

1236
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,000
variance? This is the variance.
 

1237
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,750
variance? This is the variance.
That's the claim.

1238
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:33,760

 

1239
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,110

So if you think about it, um how would

1240
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,120
So if you think about it, um how would
 

1241
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,950
So if you think about it, um how would
you go about trying to argue this or

1242
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:38,960
you go about trying to argue this or
 

1243
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,310
you go about trying to argue this or
convince yourself intuitively that

1244
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
convince yourself intuitively that
 

1245
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,230
convince yourself intuitively that
something like this might be true? Well,

1246
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
something like this might be true? Well,
 

1247
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,350
something like this might be true? Well,
there's definitely a conditional

1248
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,360
there's definitely a conditional
 

1249
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,630
there's definitely a conditional
probability here. So you have to use

1250
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
probability here. So you have to use
 

1251
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,870
probability here. So you have to use
baze rule. Okay, so there's going to be

1252
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:46,880
baze rule. Okay, so there's going to be
 

1253
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,549
baze rule. Okay, so there's going to be
a baze rule. Then we're going to have to

1254
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:50,559
a baze rule. Then we're going to have to
 

1255
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,110
a baze rule. Then we're going to have to
drop some terms appropriately.

1256
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,120
drop some terms appropriately.
 

1257
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,990
drop some terms appropriately.
And one way to think bay rule ends up

1258
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,000
And one way to think bay rule ends up
 

1259
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,710
And one way to think bay rule ends up
with ratios. And when you have ratios,

1260
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:58,720
with ratios. And when you have ratios,
 

1261
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,230
with ratios. And when you have ratios,
it's kind of tricky to think about

1262
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:00,240
it's kind of tricky to think about
 

1263
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,029
it's kind of tricky to think about
what's going on. So you take logs to get

1264
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:03,039
what's going on. So you take logs to get
 

1265
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,510
what's going on. So you take logs to get
rid of the ratio parts.

1266
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:05,520
rid of the ratio parts.
 

1267
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,310
rid of the ratio parts.
Okay, now you have to now drop terms

1268
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
Okay, now you have to now drop terms
 

1269
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,149
Okay, now you have to now drop terms
that are going to zero as delta t goes

1270
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:10,159
that are going to zero as delta t goes
 

1271
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,710
that are going to zero as delta t goes
to zero because those are the terms that

1272
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:12,720
to zero because those are the terms that
 

1273
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,350
to zero because those are the terms that
are not going to matter. And make sure

1274
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:15,360
are not going to matter. And make sure
 

1275
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,389
are not going to matter. And make sure
you can keep track of this variance.

1276
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:18,399
you can keep track of this variance.
 

1277
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,909
you can keep track of this variance.
Okay, so you want to keep track of this

1278
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919
Okay, so you want to keep track of this
 

1279
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,269
Okay, so you want to keep track of this
variance properly.

1280
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:23,279
variance properly.
 

1281
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,190
variance properly.
That's the that's the um style of what

1282
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,200
That's the that's the um style of what
 

1283
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,669
That's the that's the um style of what
we're going to do. So first baze rule.

1284
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:29,679
we're going to do. So first baze rule.
 

1285
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,389
we're going to do. So first baze rule.
Okay, this is just classic baze rule. We

1286
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
Okay, this is just classic baze rule. We
 

1287
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,669
Okay, this is just classic baze rule. We
just say conditional probability is the

1288
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:35,679
just say conditional probability is the
 

1289
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,750
just say conditional probability is the
reverse direction which we know this we

1290
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:37,760
reverse direction which we know this we
 

1291
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,950
reverse direction which we know this we
know this is the thing we know it's

1292
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:38,960
know this is the thing we know it's
 

1293
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,789
know this is the thing we know it's
grading noise. So this is something we

1294
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:40,799
grading noise. So this is something we
 

1295
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,710
grading noise. So this is something we
completely understand

1296
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
completely understand
 

1297
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,269
completely understand
um times this marginal and divided by

1298
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
um times this marginal and divided by
 

1299
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,750
um times this marginal and divided by
this thing.

1300
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:49,760
this thing.
 

1301
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,909
this thing.
Okay,

1302
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:51,919
Okay,
 

1303
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,310
Okay,
next what are we going to do? We'll take

1304
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,320
next what are we going to do? We'll take
 

1305
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:01,269
next what are we going to do? We'll take
logs. Okay, so let's see.

1306
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:01,279

 

1307
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,990

Now I have this term here that is this

1308
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
Now I have this term here that is this
 

1309
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,310
Now I have this term here that is this
minus sign. We're going to argue we can

1310
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:06,320
minus sign. We're going to argue we can
 

1311
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,149
minus sign. We're going to argue we can
drop it.

1312
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:08,159
drop it.
 

1313
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,990
drop it.
What I mean by dropping it is that we're

1314
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,000
What I mean by dropping it is that we're
 

1315
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,230
What I mean by dropping it is that we're
going to assume it's there, but it's not

1316
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:12,240
going to assume it's there, but it's not
 

1317
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,149
going to assume it's there, but it's not
going to matter.

1318
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:14,159
going to matter.
 

1319
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,430
going to matter.
Why do we think it's not going to

1320
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:15,440
Why do we think it's not going to
 

1321
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,470
Why do we think it's not going to
matter? Because what we're trying to

1322
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
matter? Because what we're trying to
 

1323
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,310
matter? Because what we're trying to
understand is the distribution for this

1324
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,320
understand is the distribution for this
 

1325
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,750
understand is the distribution for this
quantity here

1326
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
quantity here
 

1327
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,310
quantity here
in BA's rule. What this division is

1328
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,320
in BA's rule. What this division is
 

1329
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,310
in BA's rule. What this division is
doing is it's normalizing the

1330
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,320
doing is it's normalizing the
 

1331
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,590
doing is it's normalizing the
probabilities.

1332
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:33,600

 

1333
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,110

Everyone see that? It's just trying to

1334
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,120
Everyone see that? It's just trying to
 

1335
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,950
Everyone see that? It's just trying to
make sure the probabilities. It has no

1336
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:36,960
make sure the probabilities. It has no
 

1337
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,389
make sure the probabilities. It has no
dependence on the actual value of where

1338
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:40,399
dependence on the actual value of where
 

1339
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,750
dependence on the actual value of where
you're where you want to evaluate this

1340
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
you're where you want to evaluate this
 

1341
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,789
you're where you want to evaluate this
density. It's a normalizer.

1342
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:44,799
density. It's a normalizer.
 

1343
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,509
density. It's a normalizer.
Everyone see that? So what there's no

1344
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:47,519
Everyone see that? So what there's no
 

1345
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,870
Everyone see that? So what there's no
dependence on the thing we want to

1346
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:48,880
dependence on the thing we want to
 

1347
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,990
dependence on the thing we want to
understand in this term.

1348
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,000
understand in this term.
 

1349
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,070
understand in this term.
So we're just going to say we'll just do

1350
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,080
So we're just going to say we'll just do
 

1351
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,789
So we're just going to say we'll just do
normalization at the end and we'll make

1352
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:56,799
normalization at the end and we'll make
 

1353
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:57,990
normalization at the end and we'll make
it work. We just want to track what's

1354
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,000
it work. We just want to track what's
 

1355
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,389
it work. We just want to track what's
happening without the normalizer.

1356
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:00,399
happening without the normalizer.
 

1357
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,590
happening without the normalizer.
So we're going to drop it because

1358
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:01,600
So we're going to drop it because
 

1359
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,990
So we're going to drop it because
temporarily it's there in our minds but

1360
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,000
temporarily it's there in our minds but
 

1361
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,269
temporarily it's there in our minds but
we're not going to keep track of how

1362
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:05,279
we're not going to keep track of how
 

1363
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,950
we're not going to keep track of how
it's behaving because this is just going

1364
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:06,960
it's behaving because this is just going
 

1365
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,549
it's behaving because this is just going
to be taken up by we'll do normalizing

1366
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:08,559
to be taken up by we'll do normalizing
 

1367
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,950
to be taken up by we'll do normalizing
at the end.

1368
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:10,960
at the end.
 

1369
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,870
at the end.
Okay.

1370
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:12,880
Okay.
 

1371
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,149
Okay.
So now

1372
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:16,159
So now
 

1373
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,430
So now
what do we know? This term we understand

1374
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:19,440
what do we know? This term we understand
 

1375
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,909
what do we know? This term we understand
perfectly,

1376
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:21,919
perfectly,
 

1377
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,509
perfectly,
right? Because this is a Gaussian that

1378
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:23,519
right? Because this is a Gaussian that
 

1379
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,149
right? Because this is a Gaussian that
we know. So this is not a term we have

1380
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:26,159
we know. So this is not a term we have
 

1381
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,149
we know. So this is not a term we have
to do any work on except to take the log

1382
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:28,159
to do any work on except to take the log
 

1383
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,590
to do any work on except to take the log
of its density.

1384
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:31,600

 

1385
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,190

This is the term we need to now get a

1386
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,200
This is the term we need to now get a
 

1387
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,950
This is the term we need to now get a
handle on. Everyone with me?

1388
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:36,960
handle on. Everyone with me?
 

1389
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,669
handle on. Everyone with me?
Okay. So for this term what we're going

1390
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:39,679
Okay. So for this term what we're going
 

1391
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,269
Okay. So for this term what we're going
to do is we're going to say well I'm

1392
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:43,279
to do is we're going to say well I'm
 

1393
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,750
to do is we're going to say well I'm
assuming sufficient smoothness

1394
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:45,760
assuming sufficient smoothness
 

1395
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,470
assuming sufficient smoothness
and I'm assuming delta t is very small.

1396
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,480
and I'm assuming delta t is very small.
 

1397
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,310
and I'm assuming delta t is very small.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to

1398
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:50,320
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 

1399
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,789
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
tailor expand

1400
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:52,799
tailor expand
 

1401
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,870
tailor expand
this guy

1402
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:54,880
this guy
 

1403
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,909
this guy
around pt.

1404
00:33:59,909 --> 00:33:59,919

 

1405
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,430

Okay, I'll expand it around PT

1406
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,440
Okay, I'll expand it around PT
 

1407
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,110
Okay, I'll expand it around PT
which is the probability, you know, of

1408
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
which is the probability, you know, of
 

1409
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,509
which is the probability, you know, of
what's happening at time t. I'll say

1410
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:07,519
what's happening at time t. I'll say
 

1411
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,389
what's happening at time t. I'll say
it's basically the same except there's

1412
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,399
it's basically the same except there's
 

1413
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,470
it's basically the same except there's
be a correction term that I have to do

1414
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:12,480
be a correction term that I have to do
 

1415
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,990
be a correction term that I have to do
that's coming from the tailor expansion.

1416
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,000
that's coming from the tailor expansion.
 

1417
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,310
that's coming from the tailor expansion.
So remember from your tailor expansion

1418
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,320
So remember from your tailor expansion
 

1419
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,869
So remember from your tailor expansion
course a while back you learned this

1420
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:18,879
course a while back you learned this
 

1421
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,349
course a while back you learned this
that you can actually think of this as

1422
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:21,359
that you can actually think of this as
 

1423
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,149
that you can actually think of this as
being exact with the right argument in

1424
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:24,159
being exact with the right argument in
 

1425
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,550
being exact with the right argument in
here. Right? Things are sufficiently

1426
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:26,560
here. Right? Things are sufficiently
 

1427
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,470
here. Right? Things are sufficiently
smooth once you take this derivative.

1428
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,480
smooth once you take this derivative.
 

1429
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,829
smooth once you take this derivative.
you can actually evaluate it at the

1430
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:29,839
you can actually evaluate it at the
 

1431
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,389
you can actually evaluate it at the
right place and it'll be exact,

1432
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
right place and it'll be exact,
 

1433
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,069
right place and it'll be exact,
right? But you or you can think of it as

1434
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
right? But you or you can think of it as
 

1435
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,190
right? But you or you can think of it as
a bunch of higher order terms. We're

1436
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,200
a bunch of higher order terms. We're
 

1437
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,149
a bunch of higher order terms. We're
going to drop a bunch of them anyway.

1438
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:36,159
going to drop a bunch of them anyway.
 

1439
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,069
going to drop a bunch of them anyway.
We're gonna drop it all anyway.

1440
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:40,079

 

1441
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,669

Okay.

1442
00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:41,679
Okay.
 

1443
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,109
Okay.
So now once we do that

1444
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:45,119
So now once we do that
 

1445
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,190
So now once we do that
we have this term

1446
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,200
we have this term
 

1447
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,109
we have this term
this term

1448
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:51,119
this term
 

1449
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,750
this term
and we have this guy which is something

1450
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:53,760
and we have this guy which is something
 

1451
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,750
and we have this guy which is something
that's order delta t

1452
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:57,760

 

1453
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,310

plus there's normalization. So now you

1454
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:00,320
plus there's normalization. So now you
 

1455
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,349
plus there's normalization. So now you
can say wait what's going to happen?

1456
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359
can say wait what's going to happen?
 

1457
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,630
can say wait what's going to happen?
We're going to be taking the limit of

1458
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
We're going to be taking the limit of
 

1459
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,069
We're going to be taking the limit of
delta t going to zero.

1460
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
delta t going to zero.
 

1461
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,630
delta t going to zero.
Okay, so if any of these other terms are

1462
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:12,640
Okay, so if any of these other terms are
 

1463
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,750
Okay, so if any of these other terms are
not going to zero as delta t is going to

1464
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:15,760
not going to zero as delta t is going to
 

1465
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,950
not going to zero as delta t is going to
zero, then this is not going to affect

1466
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:18,960
zero, then this is not going to affect
 

1467
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,710
zero, then this is not going to affect
the normalization.

1468
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:20,720
the normalization.
 

1469
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,670
the normalization.
So we can drop this term.

1470
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
So we can drop this term.
 

1471
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,390
So we can drop this term.
Okay, this is what we will end up doing.

1472
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,400
Okay, this is what we will end up doing.
 

1473
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,310
Okay, this is what we will end up doing.
Okay, so

1474
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,320
Okay, so
 

1475
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,950
Okay, so
now let's just evaluate these guys. This

1476
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:32,960
now let's just evaluate these guys. This
 

1477
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,109
now let's just evaluate these guys. This
is just here.

1478
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:35,119
is just here.
 

1479
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,270
is just here.
This is a Gaussian. So

1480
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,280
This is a Gaussian. So
 

1481
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,190
This is a Gaussian. So
what's its density? Well, it's X.

1482
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:43,200
what's its density? Well, it's X.
 

1483
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,030
what's its density? Well, it's X.
There's a constant. A Gaussian density

1484
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,040
There's a constant. A Gaussian density
 

1485
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,950
There's a constant. A Gaussian density
has a constant in front. That's a part

1486
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:46,960
has a constant in front. That's a part
 

1487
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,790
has a constant in front. That's a part
of the normalizer. So don't worry about

1488
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:48,800
of the normalizer. So don't worry about
 

1489
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,430
of the normalizer. So don't worry about
it. Then there's an X minus squared.

1490
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:53,440
it. Then there's an X minus squared.
 

1491
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,430
it. Then there's an X minus squared.
Denominator is the uh term the variance,

1492
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,440
Denominator is the uh term the variance,
 

1493
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,390
Denominator is the uh term the variance,
right? So here is the denominator here

1494
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,400
right? So here is the denominator here
 

1495
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,550
right? So here is the denominator here
variance. And here's the squared part.

1496
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:04,560
variance. And here's the squared part.
 

1497
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,710
variance. And here's the squared part.
So once you see this, you're like,

1498
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:06,720
So once you see this, you're like,
 

1499
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,390
So once you see this, you're like,
"Yeah, I don't really worry about delta

1500
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:08,400
"Yeah, I don't really worry about delta
 

1501
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,270
"Yeah, I don't really worry about delta
t terms, right? Order delta t terms

1502
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280
t terms, right? Order delta t terms
 

1503
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,109
t terms, right? Order delta t terms
because I'm dividing by delta t here,

1504
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:15,119
because I'm dividing by delta t here,
 

1505
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,069
because I'm dividing by delta t here,
right? So this is getting big. These

1506
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:18,079
right? So this is getting big. These
 

1507
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,030
right? So this is getting big. These
terms are getting big here,

1508
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
terms are getting big here,
 

1509
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,829
terms are getting big here,
right? And so something that's very

1510
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:23,839
right? And so something that's very
 

1511
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,150
right? And so something that's very
small is not going to affect this is the

1512
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
small is not going to affect this is the
 

1513
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,670
small is not going to affect this is the
intuition.

1514
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:27,680
intuition.
 

1515
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,349
intuition.
So I have this and I have this and now I

1516
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:29,359
So I have this and I have this and now I
 

1517
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,349
So I have this and I have this and now I
can now that I know why I can kind of

1518
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:31,359
can now that I know why I can kind of
 

1519
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,349
can now that I know why I can kind of
tentatively handwavy drop it.

1520
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
tentatively handwavy drop it.
 

1521
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,230
tentatively handwavy drop it.
So now I'm going to tailor expand this

1522
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:38,240
So now I'm going to tailor expand this
 

1523
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,230
So now I'm going to tailor expand this
again

1524
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,240
again
 

1525
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,829
again
except we did it before around t the

1526
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
except we did it before around t the
 

1527
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,829
except we did it before around t the
variation in these densities with time

1528
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:45,839
variation in these densities with time
 

1529
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,030
variation in these densities with time
saying there's some small these are

1530
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,040
saying there's some small these are
 

1531
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,349
saying there's some small these are
moving smoothly the densities so small

1532
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:49,359
moving smoothly the densities so small
 

1533
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,470
moving smoothly the densities so small
change now we're going to do it around

1534
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:52,480
change now we're going to do it around
 

1535
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,430
change now we're going to do it around
position xt

1536
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,440
position xt
 

1537
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,630
position xt
okay we're going to tailor expand around

1538
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:56,640
okay we're going to tailor expand around
 

1539
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,710
okay we're going to tailor expand around
the position xt

1540
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720

 

1541
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,230

so when you do that what do we have

1542
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,240
so when you do that what do we have
 

1543
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,670
so when you do that what do we have
Okay,

1544
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:07,680

 

1545
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,790

when you around expand it around XT, you

1546
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:10,800
when you around expand it around XT, you
 

1547
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,270
when you around expand it around XT, you
get something that's log the constant

1548
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:13,280
get something that's log the constant
 

1549
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,790
get something that's log the constant
term, right? Log P of XT. Everyone good

1550
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:16,800
term, right? Log P of XT. Everyone good
 

1551
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,950
term, right? Log P of XT. Everyone good
with this?

1552
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960

 

1553
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,870

So

1554
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:22,880
So
 

1555
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,470
So
that term doesn't depend on the thing we

1556
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:24,480
that term doesn't depend on the thing we
 

1557
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,829
that term doesn't depend on the thing we
want, which is the thing we're trying to

1558
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:25,839
want, which is the thing we're trying to
 

1559
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,349
want, which is the thing we're trying to
comput the density of. So it's just

1560
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:27,359
comput the density of. So it's just
 

1561
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,069
comput the density of. So it's just
going to be part of the normalizing.

1562
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:30,079
going to be part of the normalizing.
 

1563
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,910
going to be part of the normalizing.
Okay, so this is going to get dropped

1564
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:31,920
Okay, so this is going to get dropped
 

1565
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,750
Okay, so this is going to get dropped
because of normalization.

1566
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:33,760
because of normalization.
 

1567
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,150
because of normalization.
And then we have the first order term

1568
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,160
And then we have the first order term
 

1569
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,310
And then we have the first order term
that we care about. What's the first

1570
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:38,320
that we care about. What's the first
 

1571
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,550
that we care about. What's the first
order term? It's the gradient

1572
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:42,560
order term? It's the gradient
 

1573
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,910
order term? It's the gradient
with respect to x. Remember these are

1574
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
with respect to x. Remember these are
 

1575
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,910
with respect to x. Remember these are
all vectors. The gradient with respect

1576
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:45,920
all vectors. The gradient with respect
 

1577
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,550
all vectors. The gradient with respect
to x of this log term

1578
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:48,560
to x of this log term
 

1579
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,750
to x of this log term
inner product with how far you moved.

1580
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
inner product with how far you moved.
 

1581
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,910
inner product with how far you moved.
Remember we're centered at xt. We want

1582
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:55,920
Remember we're centered at xt. We want
 

1583
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,430
Remember we're centered at xt. We want
to evaluate what's happening here. So

1584
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
to evaluate what's happening here. So
 

1585
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,470
to evaluate what's happening here. So
this is the amount we've deviated. And

1586
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:00,480
this is the amount we've deviated. And
 

1587
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,150
this is the amount we've deviated. And
what's going to change is it's going to

1588
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,160
what's going to change is it's going to
 

1589
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,190
what's going to change is it's going to
change with the inner product with the

1590
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,200
change with the inner product with the
 

1591
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,790
change with the inner product with the
gradient.

1592
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:04,800
gradient.
 

1593
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,990
gradient.
This is our tailor expanding of things

1594
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:08,000
This is our tailor expanding of things
 

1595
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,790
This is our tailor expanding of things
perspective

1596
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:10,800
perspective
 

1597
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,990
perspective
and then there'll be higher order terms

1598
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,000
and then there'll be higher order terms
 

1599
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,390
and then there'll be higher order terms
that we're going to not worry about.

1600
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:18,400
that we're going to not worry about.
 

1601
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,950
that we're going to not worry about.
Okay. So once we have it in this form we

1602
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:22,960
Okay. So once we have it in this form we
 

1603
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,150
Okay. So once we have it in this form we
say okay these are the two terms we're

1604
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,160
say okay these are the two terms we're
 

1605
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,710
say okay these are the two terms we're
going to work keep around.

1606
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:28,720

 

1607
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,589

I'm gonna bring this thing inside this

1608
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:31,599
I'm gonna bring this thing inside this
 

1609
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,069
I'm gonna bring this thing inside this
parenthesis basically.

1610
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
parenthesis basically.
 

1611
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,349
parenthesis basically.
So how do I bring it inside the

1612
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:35,359
So how do I bring it inside the
 

1613
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,950
So how do I bring it inside the
parenthesis? I just divide whatever I'm

1614
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:36,960
parenthesis? I just divide whatever I'm
 

1615
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,030
parenthesis? I just divide whatever I'm
dividing by I stick over here. So up

1616
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,040
dividing by I stick over here. So up
 

1617
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,870
dividing by I stick over here. So up
here I had a plus inner product.

1618
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,880
here I had a plus inner product.
 

1619
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,870
here I had a plus inner product.
Now I have a minus this thing inner

1620
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:46,880
Now I have a minus this thing inner
 

1621
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,550
Now I have a minus this thing inner
product.

1622
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:48,560
product.
 

1623
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,710
product.
And now you can see the end in sight

1624
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720
And now you can see the end in sight
 

1625
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,390
And now you can see the end in sight
because you have only a few tricks you

1626
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:52,400
because you have only a few tricks you
 

1627
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,150
because you have only a few tricks you
use and you see oh one of my standard

1628
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,160
use and you see oh one of my standard
 

1629
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,470
use and you see oh one of my standard
tricks is now going to work. I have

1630
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:56,480
tricks is now going to work. I have
 

1631
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,750
tricks is now going to work. I have
something which looks like a norm

1632
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:57,760
something which looks like a norm
 

1633
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,270
something which looks like a norm
squared

1634
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,280
squared
 

1635
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,829
squared
and I have an inner product term which

1636
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:01,839
and I have an inner product term which
 

1637
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,510
and I have an inner product term which
has as one of the things in the inner

1638
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,520
has as one of the things in the inner
 

1639
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,270
has as one of the things in the inner
product the thing whose norm I'm

1640
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,280
product the thing whose norm I'm
 

1641
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,510
product the thing whose norm I'm
squaring.

1642
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,520
squaring.
 

1643
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,150
squaring.
So you go oh this is the classic when I

1644
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,160
So you go oh this is the classic when I
 

1645
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,470
So you go oh this is the classic when I
work with Gaussians complete the square

1646
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:12,480
work with Gaussians complete the square
 

1647
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,069
work with Gaussians complete the square
situation.

1648
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:14,079
situation.
 

1649
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,030
situation.
Okay whenever you're working with a

1650
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,040
Okay whenever you're working with a
 

1651
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,790
Okay whenever you're working with a
Gaussian density you think maybe I need

1652
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:16,800
Gaussian density you think maybe I need
 

1653
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,349
Gaussian density you think maybe I need
to complete the square.

1654
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:19,359
to complete the square.
 

1655
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,950
to complete the square.
So one simply does that trick.

1656
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:22,960
So one simply does that trick.
 

1657
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,109
So one simply does that trick.
You complete the square and you say

1658
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:27,119
You complete the square and you say
 

1659
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,470
You complete the square and you say
I will take this expression

1660
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,480
I will take this expression
 

1661
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,670
I will take this expression
and

1662
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:33,680

 

1663
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,950

there's a thing I'm inner producting

1664
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:34,960
there's a thing I'm inner producting
 

1665
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,109
there's a thing I'm inner producting
with

1666
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:37,119
with
 

1667
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,430
with
this I think of this as the cross term.

1668
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:39,440
this I think of this as the cross term.
 

1669
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,109
this I think of this as the cross term.
This is the square term and there's

1670
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:41,119
This is the square term and there's
 

1671
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,030
This is the square term and there's
another term that's like the the

1672
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,040
another term that's like the the
 

1673
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,430
another term that's like the the
crossing thing squared but that has no

1674
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:45,440
crossing thing squared but that has no
 

1675
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,950
crossing thing squared but that has no
dependence on this this thing that I

1676
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:46,960
dependence on this this thing that I
 

1677
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,630
dependence on this this thing that I
care about.

1678
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:48,640
care about.
 

1679
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,470
care about.
So it's just another constant as far as

1680
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:50,480
So it's just another constant as far as
 

1681
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,310
So it's just another constant as far as
I'm concerned.

1682
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
I'm concerned.
 

1683
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,069
I'm concerned.
Okay.

1684
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:54,079
Okay.
 

1685
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,109
Okay.
So now I have something which looks

1686
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:57,119
So now I have something which looks
 

1687
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,710
So now I have something which looks
exactly

1688
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:58,720
exactly
 

1689
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,710
exactly
like the

1690
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,720
like the
 

1691
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,990
like the
log of the density of a Gaussian

1692
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,000
log of the density of a Gaussian
 

1693
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,390
log of the density of a Gaussian
except it has a mean now.

1694
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:08,400

 

1695
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,069

And what's that mean? That mean

1696
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:12,079
And what's that mean? That mean
 

1697
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,230
And what's that mean? That mean
that mean is something that is XT.

1698
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,240
that mean is something that is XT.
 

1699
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,310
that mean is something that is XT.
Namely remember you're moving very tiny

1700
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:18,320
Namely remember you're moving very tiny
 

1701
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,510
Namely remember you're moving very tiny
bits. So you're going to where do you

1702
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:19,520
bits. So you're going to where do you
 

1703
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,910
bits. So you're going to where do you
expect to be roughly where you are

1704
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:21,920
expect to be roughly where you are
 

1705
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,589
expect to be roughly where you are
except a change a small change a delta t

1706
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:25,599
except a change a small change a delta t
 

1707
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,430
except a change a small change a delta t
change

1708
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:27,440
change
 

1709
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,390
change
right in this direction.

1710
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,400

 

1711
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,589

And so this argument

1712
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:35,599
And so this argument
 

1713
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,630
And so this argument
tells you that great I now have a mean

1714
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
tells you that great I now have a mean
 

1715
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,550
tells you that great I now have a mean
that I want and I also have a variance

1716
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:46,560

 

1717
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,310

and the variance is the same variance I

1718
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:48,320
and the variance is the same variance I
 

1719
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,230
and the variance is the same variance I
started with. Nothing around this in

1720
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,240
started with. Nothing around this in
 

1721
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,829
started with. Nothing around this in
this path of computation changed what

1722
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:51,839
this path of computation changed what
 

1723
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,069
this path of computation changed what
that variance was.

1724
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:54,079
that variance was.
 

1725
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,190
that variance was.
Okay. So this is a little bit handwavy

1726
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,200
Okay. So this is a little bit handwavy
 

1727
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,349
Okay. So this is a little bit handwavy
like all these dropping of terms is not

1728
00:40:59,349 --> 00:40:59,359
like all these dropping of terms is not
 

1729
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,190
like all these dropping of terms is not
exactly justified. The appendix argues

1730
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,200
exactly justified. The appendix argues
 

1731
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,750
exactly justified. The appendix argues
in the paper argues why this is okay uh

1732
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:05,760
in the paper argues why this is okay uh
 

1733
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,230
in the paper argues why this is okay uh
to drop why all these are actually legal

1734
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:08,240
to drop why all these are actually legal
 

1735
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,910
to drop why all these are actually legal
uh maneuvers to drop. Um but this gives

1736
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
uh maneuvers to drop. Um but this gives
 

1737
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,230
uh maneuvers to drop. Um but this gives
you a sense of why this is true. So it

1738
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,240
you a sense of why this is true. So it
 

1739
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,510
you a sense of why this is true. So it
says that basically if you're in a part

1740
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
says that basically if you're in a part
 

1741
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,030
says that basically if you're in a part
intuition is if you're in a density

1742
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,040
intuition is if you're in a density
 

1743
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,630
intuition is if you're in a density
that's pretty flat here that's what

1744
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:20,640
that's pretty flat here that's what
 

1745
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,630
that's pretty flat here that's what
sufficient smooth means sufficiently

1746
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:22,640
sufficient smooth means sufficiently
 

1747
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,109
sufficient smooth means sufficiently
flat here and then you convolve with a

1748
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:25,119
flat here and then you convolve with a
 

1749
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,069
flat here and then you convolve with a
Gaussian here it's still going to be

1750
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:28,079
Gaussian here it's still going to be
 

1751
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,870
Gaussian here it's still going to be
sufficiently flat. Convolving convolving

1752
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:30,880
sufficiently flat. Convolving convolving
 

1753
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,630
sufficiently flat. Convolving convolving
the Gaussian smooths things. So it was

1754
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:32,640
the Gaussian smooths things. So it was
 

1755
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,230
the Gaussian smooths things. So it was
flat to begin with. That's sufficiently

1756
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,240
flat to begin with. That's sufficiently
 

1757
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,750
flat to begin with. That's sufficiently
smooth. Convolve the Gaussian. It's

1758
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:35,760
smooth. Convolve the Gaussian. It's
 

1759
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,670
smooth. Convolve the Gaussian. It's
still pretty much the same. That's how

1760
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:37,680
still pretty much the same. That's how
 

1761
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,430
still pretty much the same. That's how
what led us make this step of moving

1762
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,440
what led us make this step of moving
 

1763
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,309
what led us make this step of moving
from PT to PT minus delta as roughly the

1764
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:42,319
from PT to PT minus delta as roughly the
 

1765
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,630
from PT to PT minus delta as roughly the
same. Okay. And what do you expect to

1766
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:46,640
same. Okay. And what do you expect to
 

1767
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,069
same. Okay. And what do you expect to
have happened? You expect to have

1768
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:48,079
have happened? You expect to have
 

1769
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,950
have happened? You expect to have
happened is that even looking backwards,

1770
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:50,960
happened is that even looking backwards,
 

1771
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,270
happened is that even looking backwards,
it's you moved in this in this flat

1772
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,280
it's you moved in this in this flat
 

1773
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,950
it's you moved in this in this flat
spot. So even looking backwards, it's

1774
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:54,960
spot. So even looking backwards, it's
 

1775
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,109
spot. So even looking backwards, it's
like a Gaussian. Same Gaussian smoothing

1776
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
like a Gaussian. Same Gaussian smoothing
 

1777
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,790
like a Gaussian. Same Gaussian smoothing
going in the reverse direction. That's

1778
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:58,800
going in the reverse direction. That's
 

1779
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,510
going in the reverse direction. That's
the kind of the rough intuition behind

1780
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:01,520
the kind of the rough intuition behind
 

1781
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,790
the kind of the rough intuition behind
this proof of what's happening. You

1782
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:04,800
this proof of what's happening. You
 

1783
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,710
this proof of what's happening. You
needed to do the calculations to track

1784
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:06,720
needed to do the calculations to track
 

1785
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,069
needed to do the calculations to track
that the mean was actually doing

1786
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
that the mean was actually doing
 

1787
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,390
that the mean was actually doing
something, right? This intuition doesn't

1788
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:10,400
something, right? This intuition doesn't
 

1789
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,750
something, right? This intuition doesn't
tell you what direction the mean's going

1790
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:11,760
tell you what direction the mean's going
 

1791
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,150
tell you what direction the mean's going
to go. And what this tells you is the

1792
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,160
to go. And what this tells you is the
 

1793
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,670
to go. And what this tells you is the
mean's deviation has to do with the

1794
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:17,680
mean's deviation has to do with the
 

1795
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,150
mean's deviation has to do with the
gradient of the log probability. This is

1796
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,160
gradient of the log probability. This is
 

1797
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,710
gradient of the log probability. This is
called the score.

1798
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:22,720
called the score.
 

1799
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,950
called the score.
Okay, this thing is called score.

1800
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:26,960

 

1801
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,950

So if you read papers you talk about

1802
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
So if you read papers you talk about
 

1803
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,950
So if you read papers you talk about
diffusion as score matching and stuff

1804
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:30,960
diffusion as score matching and stuff
 

1805
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,589
diffusion as score matching and stuff
like this that's fancy way of saying

1806
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:33,599
like this that's fancy way of saying
 

1807
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,910
like this that's fancy way of saying
learning that term

1808
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:37,920

 

1809
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:48,390

this thing

1810
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:48,400

 

1811
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,109

>> yeah questions

1812
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
>> yeah questions
 

1813
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,390
>> yeah questions
>> conflicting

1814
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:54,400

 

1815
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,870

so I

1816
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880

 

1817
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:05,030

est

1818
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:05,040

 

1819
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:14,790

you added noise going backwards and then

1820
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:14,800

 

1821
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,829

you had the logability

1822
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:17,839
you had the logability
 

1823
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,230
you had the logability
then you say

1824
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:22,240

 

1825
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,710

that term is being subtracted

1826
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:24,720
that term is being subtracted
 

1827
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,710
that term is being subtracted
I guess I'm just a bit lost in

1828
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:26,720
I guess I'm just a bit lost in
 

1829
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,670
I guess I'm just a bit lost in
clarification.

1830
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:27,680
clarification.
 

1831
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,550
clarification.
>> Sure. So let me uh clarify this first

1832
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:30,560
>> Sure. So let me uh clarify this first
 

1833
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,829
>> Sure. So let me uh clarify this first
clarification is that in our particular

1834
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
clarification is that in our particular
 

1835
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,790
clarification is that in our particular
definition of this mut right we it's a

1836
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:36,800
definition of this mut right we it's a
 

1837
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,309
definition of this mut right we it's a
mean of it's a mean of something that we

1838
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:38,319
mean of it's a mean of something that we
 

1839
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,510
mean of it's a mean of something that we
learn this the the step going backward

1840
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,520
learn this the the step going backward
 

1841
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,510
learn this the the step going backward
to do the the reverse diffusion that we

1842
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:43,520
to do the the reverse diffusion that we
 

1843
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,230
to do the the reverse diffusion that we
do the degeneration is just to use that

1844
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,240
do the degeneration is just to use that
 

1845
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,150
do the degeneration is just to use that
mean. There's no subtractions here. It's

1846
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,160
mean. There's no subtractions here. It's
 

1847
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,069
mean. There's no subtractions here. It's
just using that mean and then we add

1848
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
just using that mean and then we add
 

1849
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,309
just using that mean and then we add
noise. The reason we add noise is to so

1850
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:54,319
noise. The reason we add noise is to so
 

1851
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,829
noise. The reason we add noise is to so
because we want to simulate we want to

1852
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:55,839
because we want to simulate we want to
 

1853
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,829
because we want to simulate we want to
draw from this density.

1854
00:43:59,829 --> 00:43:59,839

 

1855
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,109

We want to pick we want to draw

1856
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
We want to pick we want to draw
 

1857
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,710
We want to pick we want to draw
basically all we want to do is to sample

1858
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:02,720
basically all we want to do is to sample
 

1859
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,630
basically all we want to do is to sample
from this density. We do that in two

1860
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:04,640
from this density. We do that in two
 

1861
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,870
from this density. We do that in two
steps for any Gaussian. We take the mean

1862
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:06,880
steps for any Gaussian. We take the mean
 

1863
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,270
steps for any Gaussian. We take the mean
and we sample from a zero mean Gaussian.

1864
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:09,280
and we sample from a zero mean Gaussian.
 

1865
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,309
and we sample from a zero mean Gaussian.
That's all we're doing here. There's

1866
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:10,319
That's all we're doing here. There's
 

1867
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,069
That's all we're doing here. There's
nothing particularly fancy and there's

1868
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:12,079
nothing particularly fancy and there's
 

1869
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,790
nothing particularly fancy and there's
no subtractions happening here.

1870
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:14,800
no subtractions happening here.
 

1871
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,390
no subtractions happening here.
Um

1872
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:16,400
Um
 

1873
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,510
Um
here this Gaussian density is just we

1874
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:19,520
here this Gaussian density is just we
 

1875
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,190
here this Gaussian density is just we
said that the conditional density of the

1876
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:23,200
said that the conditional density of the
 

1877
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,670
said that the conditional density of the
next forward step in the diffusion given

1878
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:25,680
next forward step in the diffusion given
 

1879
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,069
next forward step in the diffusion given
where you were before is a Gaussian

1880
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:28,079
where you were before is a Gaussian
 

1881
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,030
where you were before is a Gaussian
centered here with a variance that we

1882
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,040
centered here with a variance that we
 

1883
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,470
centered here with a variance that we
said. So this is just writing that out.

1884
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:34,480
said. So this is just writing that out.
 

1885
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,390
said. So this is just writing that out.
Gaussian centered here this variance.

1886
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,400
Gaussian centered here this variance.
 

1887
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,750
Gaussian centered here this variance.
We'll come back to this thinking about

1888
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:39,760
We'll come back to this thinking about
 

1889
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,109
We'll come back to this thinking about
subtraction in a It'll play a very

1890
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:41,119
subtraction in a It'll play a very
 

1891
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,550
subtraction in a It'll play a very
important role in a moment, but it's not

1892
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:42,560
important role in a moment, but it's not
 

1893
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,990
important role in a moment, but it's not
not yet.

not yet.
 

1895
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,190
not yet.
>> Yeah.

1896
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:51,200

 

1897
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,910

>> Uh, sure. But that's not Yeah, that but

>> Uh, sure. But that's not Yeah, that but
 

1899
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,390
>> Uh, sure. But that's not Yeah, that but
that's not it's true, but that doesn't

1900
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,400
that's not it's true, but that doesn't
 

1901
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,390
that's not it's true, but that doesn't
matter.

1902
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,400
matter.
 

1903
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,510
matter.
>> Yeah,

1904
00:44:59,510 --> 00:44:59,520
>> Yeah,
 

1905
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,230
>> Yeah,
>> I have two questions. So, first, can you

1906
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,240
>> I have two questions. So, first, can you
 

1907
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,030
>> I have two questions. So, first, can you
explain like why exactly can drop the

1908
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,040
explain like why exactly can drop the
 

1909
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,309
explain like why exactly can drop the
normalization again? Ah the reason we

1910
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:08,319
normalization again? Ah the reason we
 

1911
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,910
normalization again? Ah the reason we
can drop when I said we're dropping the

1912
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:09,920
can drop when I said we're dropping the
 

1913
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,910
can drop when I said we're dropping the
normalization is just that we're

1914
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:11,920
normalization is just that we're
 

1915
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,829
normalization is just that we're
remembering it's there but we're not

1916
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:13,839
remembering it's there but we're not
 

1917
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,190
remembering it's there but we're not
going to write it down. So everything

1918
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:15,200
going to write it down. So everything
 

1919
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,190
going to write it down. So everything
here is plus normalization plus at the

1920
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,200
here is plus normalization plus at the
 

1921
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,390
here is plus normalization plus at the
end whatever we get we'll have to

1922
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:18,400
end whatever we get we'll have to
 

1923
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,069
end whatever we get we'll have to
normalize it.

1924
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:20,079
normalize it.
 

1925
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,910
normalize it.
>> Okay. It doesn't have a dependence on

00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:21,920
>> Okay. It doesn't have a dependence on
 

1927
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,349
>> Okay. It doesn't have a dependence on
the thing where that we're trying to

1928
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359
the thing where that we're trying to
 

1929
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,230
the thing where that we're trying to
calculate the density of

1930
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:26,240
calculate the density of
 

1931
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,550
calculate the density of
is a normalizer. So we don't we're not

1932
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:30,560
is a normalizer. So we don't we're not
 

1933
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,870
is a normalizer. So we don't we're not
dropping it. We're just deferring it.

1934
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:34,880
dropping it. We're just deferring it.
 

1935
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,109
dropping it. We're just deferring it.
And then at the end what we get is

1936
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:37,119
And then at the end what we get is
 

1937
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,950
And then at the end what we get is
something that says, "Oh, I got

1938
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:38,960
something that says, "Oh, I got
 

1939
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,150
something that says, "Oh, I got
something that looks

1940
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:42,160
something that looks
 

1941
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,430
something that looks
like a Gaussian."

1942
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:45,440
like a Gaussian."
 

1943
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,910
like a Gaussian."
And this is big

1944
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:47,920
And this is big
 

1945
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,150
And this is big
in some places

1946
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
in some places
 

1947
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,069
in some places
plus stuff that's order delta t.

1948
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:54,079
plus stuff that's order delta t.
 

1949
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,750
plus stuff that's order delta t.
So there's no way that's going to affect

1950
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,760
So there's no way that's going to affect
 

1951
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,670
So there's no way that's going to affect
the normalizer.

1952
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:57,680
the normalizer.
 

1953
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,790
the normalizer.
It's too small.

1954
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:00,800
It's too small.
 

1955
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,390
It's too small.
Okay,

1956
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:02,400
Okay,
 

1957
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,390
Okay,
that's that's why we can then say okay,

1958
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:04,400
that's that's why we can then say okay,
 

1959
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,829
that's that's why we can then say okay,
it just normalizes to a Gaussian. All

1960
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:05,839
it just normalizes to a Gaussian. All
 

1961
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,510
it just normalizes to a Gaussian. All
the stuff I dropped that was order delta

1962
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:07,520
the stuff I dropped that was order delta
 

1963
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,790
the stuff I dropped that was order delta
t that those were I was actually

1964
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:08,800
t that those were I was actually
 

1965
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,670
t that those were I was actually
dropping those didn't matter in the

1966
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,680
dropping those didn't matter in the
 

1967
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,030
dropping those didn't matter in the
thing that I was deferring the

1968
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:13,040
thing that I was deferring the
 

1969
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,829
thing that I was deferring the
normalizer.

1970
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:15,839
normalizer.
 

1971
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,990
normalizer.
>> Okay. Yeah. Question.

1972
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,000
>> Okay. Yeah. Question.
 

1973
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,309
>> Okay. Yeah. Question.
>> I'm not sure I understood when you were

1974

talking about the convolving.

talking about the convolving.
 

1977
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,349
talking about the convolving.
Where does that come in this picture? Uh

1978
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:27,359
Where does that come in this picture? Uh
 

1979
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,190
Where does that come in this picture? Uh
so that was an intuition designed to

1980
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,200
so that was an intuition designed to
 

1981
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,950
so that was an intuition designed to
help people try to connect some of the

1982
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:30,960
help people try to connect some of the
 

1983
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,430
help people try to connect some of the
mathematical moves to intuitions. Um if

1984
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:33,440
mathematical moves to intuitions. Um if
 

1985
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,710
mathematical moves to intuitions. Um if
you're comfortable with the mathematical

1986
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:34,720
you're comfortable with the mathematical
 

1987
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,470
you're comfortable with the mathematical
moves argued under sufficient

1988
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:36,480
moves argued under sufficient
 

1989
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,030
moves argued under sufficient
smoothness, you don't need that. So all

1990
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
smoothness, you don't need that. So all
 

1991
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,030
smoothness, you don't need that. So all
I was saying is that when we're arguing

1992
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,040
I was saying is that when we're arguing
 

1993
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,510
I was saying is that when we're arguing
for sufficient smoothness like we're

1994
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:43,520
for sufficient smoothness like we're
 

1995
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,030
for sufficient smoothness like we're
saying all this works with sufficient

1996
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
saying all this works with sufficient
 

1997
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,790
saying all this works with sufficient
smoothness of these probability

1998
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:46,800
smoothness of these probability
 

1999
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,630
smoothness of these probability
distributions

2000
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:48,640
distributions
 

2001
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,589
distributions
that's then I was saying why is it that

2002
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:51,599
that's then I was saying why is it that
 

2003
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,910
that's then I was saying why is it that
it's reasonable that

2004
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:57,920

 

2005
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,829

This

2006
00:46:59,829 --> 00:46:59,839
This
 

2007
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,150
This
this particular thing ended up being

2008
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,160
this particular thing ended up being
 

2009
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,670
this particular thing ended up being
replaced with

2011
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,349

uh yeah ended up being replaced with

2012
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:09,359
uh yeah ended up being replaced with
 

2013
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,390
uh yeah ended up being replaced with
this guy is because these are very

2014

this guy is because these are very
 

2015
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,390
this guy is because these are very

smooth and the only difference between
 

2017
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,349
smooth and the only difference between
PT minus delta t and pt is that it was

2018
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:17,359
PT minus delta t and pt is that it was
 

2019
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,069
PT minus delta t and pt is that it was
convolved with a very tiny Gaussian. So

2020
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:20,079
convolved with a very tiny Gaussian. So
 

2021
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,750
convolved with a very tiny Gaussian. So
smoothing with a very tiny Gaussian

2022
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:21,760
smoothing with a very tiny Gaussian
 

2023
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,270
smoothing with a very tiny Gaussian
basically didn't change that density

2024
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:23,280
basically didn't change that density
 

2025
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,790
basically didn't change that density
because it was already very flat here.

2026
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:26,800
because it was already very flat here.
 

2027
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,430
because it was already very flat here.

things aren't changing that much. You

2036
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:36,560
things aren't changing that much. You
 

2037
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,829
things aren't changing that much. You
can neglect almost everything. But if

2038
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:37,839
can neglect almost everything. But if
 

2039
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,510
can neglect almost everything. But if
you just did that, you would get the

2040
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:39,520
you just did that, you would get the
 

2041
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,470
you just did that, you would get the
mean being zero. And that's wrong. So

2042
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:42,480
mean being zero. And that's wrong. So
 

2043
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,750
mean being zero. And that's wrong. So
you have to track it a little bit

00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:43,760
you have to track it a little bit
 

2045
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,990
you have to track it a little bit
carefully to get the mean. And the mean

2046
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:46,000
carefully to get the mean. And the mean
 

2047
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,829
carefully to get the mean. And the mean
is almost

2048
00:47:47,829 --> 00:47:47,839
is almost
 

2049
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,069
is almost
just staying here except there is the

2050
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:50,079
just staying here except there is the
 

2051
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,390
just staying here except there is the
score multiplied by delta t term in the

2052
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,400
score multiplied by delta t term in the
 

2053
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,990
score multiplied by delta t term in the
mean. So the delta t that matters is a

2054
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,000
mean. So the delta t that matters is a
 

2055
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,190
mean. So the delta t that matters is a
small movement in the score direction um

2056
00:47:59,190 --> 00:47:59,200
small movement in the score direction um
 

2057
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,630
small movement in the score direction um
in the mean but not otherwise modulating

2058
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
in the mean but not otherwise modulating
 

2059
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,470
in the mean but not otherwise modulating
the density. That's the whole point of

2060
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:04,480
the density. That's the whole point of
 

2061
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,670
the density. That's the whole point of
the argument. So this is like a a kind

2062
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
the argument. So this is like a a kind
 

2063
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,309
the argument. So this is like a a kind
of this is this

2064
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:10,319
of this is this
 

2065
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,470
of this is this
half handwavy math that you can use to

2066
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:14,480
half handwavy math that you can use to
 

2067
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,309
half handwavy math that you can use to
understand what might be happening but

2068
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:16,319
understand what might be happening but
 

2069
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,470
understand what might be happening but
for math points of view. So this is very

2070
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:18,480
for math points of view. So this is very
 

2071
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,990
for math points of view. So this is very
useful for someone in deep learning to

2072
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,000
useful for someone in deep learning to
 

2073
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,430
useful for someone in deep learning to
be able to do because it lets you get

2074
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:23,440
be able to do because it lets you get
 

2075
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,990
be able to do because it lets you get
some guidance of what might be happening

2076
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,000
some guidance of what might be happening
 

2077
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,990
some guidance of what might be happening
at that point. There's two choices of

2078
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:28,000
at that point. There's two choices of
 

2079
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,270
at that point. There's two choices of
what to do. Choice one says let me try

2080
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:31,280
what to do. Choice one says let me try
 

2081
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,910
what to do. Choice one says let me try
to make all these arguments rigorous.

2082
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:33,920
to make all these arguments rigorous.
 

2083
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,309
to make all these arguments rigorous.
Okay, important choice. People do this.

2084
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:36,319
Okay, important choice. People do this.
 

2085
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,230
Okay, important choice. People do this.
Second choice. I now have enough stuff

2086
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:38,240
Second choice. I now have enough stuff
 

2087
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,030
Second choice. I now have enough stuff
to write code. Let me code it up and see

2088
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,040
to write code. Let me code it up and see
 

2089
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,670
to write code. Let me code it up and see
if it works,

2090
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
if it works,
 

2091
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,030
if it works,
right? And then if it works, you're

2092
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:45,040
right? And then if it works, you're
 

2093
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,390
right? And then if it works, you're
like, great, now it's worth making it

2094
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:46,400
like, great, now it's worth making it
 

2095
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,870
like, great, now it's worth making it
rigorous or not, right? But if it

2096
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:48,880
rigorous or not, right? But if it
 

2097
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,069
rigorous or not, right? But if it
doesn't work, you're like, oh, I have to

2098
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:50,079
doesn't work, you're like, oh, I have to
 

2099
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,710
doesn't work, you're like, oh, I have to
fix something. So this is like it's it's

2100
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:52,720
fix something. So this is like it's it's
 

2101
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,549
fix something. So this is like it's it's
a skill to be able to figure out like,

2102
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:54,559
a skill to be able to figure out like,
 

2103
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,910
a skill to be able to figure out like,
okay, is this even reasonable?

2104
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:57,920
okay, is this even reasonable?
 

2105
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,510
okay, is this even reasonable?
Okay, I'll take a couple more questions.

2106
00:48:59,510 --> 00:48:59,520
Okay, I'll take a couple more questions.
 

2107
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,790
Okay, I'll take a couple more questions.
I want to move on because I want to get

2108
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:00,800
I want to move on because I want to get
 

2109
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,150
I want to move on because I want to get
you to see understand how you can work

2110
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:02,160
you to see understand how you can work
 

2111
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,630
you to see understand how you can work
deterministically too. Yes.

2112
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:04,640
deterministically too. Yes.
 

2113
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,030
deterministically too. Yes.
>> Do you mind elaborating one more time on

2114
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:07,040
>> Do you mind elaborating one more time on
 

2115
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,430
>> Do you mind elaborating one more time on
this

2116
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:09,440
this
 

2117
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,190
this
very

2118
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:13,200

 

2119
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,950

>> this one? Okay. Yeah. I'll talk about

2120
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:14,960
>> this one? Okay. Yeah. I'll talk about
 

2121
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,470
>> this one? Okay. Yeah. I'll talk about
this one. This guy, this is the one I

2122
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:18,480
this one. This guy, this is the one I
 

2123
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,710
this one. This guy, this is the one I
was just describing in words. So, this

2124
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:20,720
was just describing in words. So, this
 

2125
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,589
was just describing in words. So, this
is saying that I have a term here that I

2126
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:23,599
is saying that I have a term here that I
 

2127
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,829
is saying that I have a term here that I
don't really like. Okay. Um, I would

2128
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:27,839
don't really like. Okay. Um, I would
 

2129
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,630
don't really like. Okay. Um, I would
much prefer this to just be uh PT and

2130
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:32,640
much prefer this to just be uh PT and
 

2131
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,150
much prefer this to just be uh PT and
not PT minus delta t. You could kind of

2132
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:36,160
not PT minus delta t. You could kind of
 

2133
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,069
not PT minus delta t. You could kind of
follow the argument through just keeping

2134
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:38,079
follow the argument through just keeping
 

2135
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,750
follow the argument through just keeping
it pt minus delta t like it's it's okay.

2136
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:41,760
it pt minus delta t like it's it's okay.
 

2137
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,589
it pt minus delta t like it's it's okay.
What would happen? This this has let me

2138
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:43,599
What would happen? This this has let me
 

2139
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,630
What would happen? This this has let me
change this into this. So first

2140
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:46,640
change this into this. So first
 

2141
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,790
change this into this. So first
understand the import of it and then we

2142
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:48,800
understand the import of it and then we
 

2143
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,109
understand the import of it and then we
talk about why it's a valid move. So if

2144
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:51,119
talk about why it's a valid move. So if
 

2145
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,710
talk about why it's a valid move. So if
you think about this, if I kept a pt

2146
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:52,720
you think about this, if I kept a pt
 

2147
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,950
you think about this, if I kept a pt
minus delta t here, what would happen? I

2148
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:54,960
minus delta t here, what would happen? I
 

2149
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:01,430
minus delta t here, what would happen? I
would keep a pt minus delta t here

2150
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:01,440

 

2151
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,190

and then I would have to tailor expand

2152
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,200
and then I would have to tailor expand
 

2153
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,750
and then I would have to tailor expand
pt minus delta t in this way and I would

2154
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:09,760
pt minus delta t in this way and I would
 

2155
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,990
pt minus delta t in this way and I would
get uh log pt minus delta t still of xt

2156
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,000
get uh log pt minus delta t still of xt
 

2157
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,750
get uh log pt minus delta t still of xt
here and I'd get a gradient of the log

2158
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:19,760
here and I'd get a gradient of the log
 

2159
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,710
here and I'd get a gradient of the log
of pt minus delta t here

2160
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:22,720
of pt minus delta t here
 

2161
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,349
of pt minus delta t here
still of xt

2162
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:25,359
still of xt
 

2163
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,230
still of xt
And this would still be the same. Do you

2164
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:28,240
And this would still be the same. Do you
 

2165
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,950
And this would still be the same. Do you
see that? So if I didn't do that step, I

2166
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:30,960
see that? So if I didn't do that step, I
 

2167
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,349
see that? So if I didn't do that step, I
could still drop this term because

2168
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:33,359
could still drop this term because
 

2169
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,349
could still drop this term because
although it has a delta t dependence, it

2170
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:35,359
although it has a delta t dependence, it
 

2171
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,190
although it has a delta t dependence, it
doesn't have an xt minus delta t

2172
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:37,200
doesn't have an xt minus delta t
 

2173
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,349
doesn't have an xt minus delta t
dependence. The thing whose density I'm

2174
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:39,359
dependence. The thing whose density I'm
 

2175
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,430
dependence. The thing whose density I'm
calculating. So this is dropping it in

2176
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:41,440
calculating. So this is dropping it in
 

2177
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,829
calculating. So this is dropping it in
terms of normalization is still valid.

2178
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:43,839
terms of normalization is still valid.
 

2179
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,510
terms of normalization is still valid.
And this tailor expansion having a delta

2180
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520
And this tailor expansion having a delta
 

2181
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,710
And this tailor expansion having a delta
t kind of terms on top of it is also

2182
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:50,720
t kind of terms on top of it is also
 

2183
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,630
t kind of terms on top of it is also
still valid.

2184
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:52,640
still valid.
 

2185
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,150
still valid.
So from that point of view it would just

2186
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:56,160
So from that point of view it would just
 

2187
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,030
So from that point of view it would just
change this expression

2188
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,040
change this expression
 

2189
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,950
change this expression
to be instead of the score at P of PT

2190
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
to be instead of the score at P of PT
 

2191
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,750
to be instead of the score at P of PT
the score of PT minus delta T which from

2192
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:05,760
the score of PT minus delta T which from
 

2193
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,030
the score of PT minus delta T which from
our point of view since this is the

2194
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
our point of view since this is the
 

2195
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,470
our point of view since this is the
thing we're learning anyway we don't

2196
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:08,480
thing we're learning anyway we don't
 

2197
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,549
thing we're learning anyway we don't
really care about. So first the import

2198
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:10,559
really care about. So first the import
 

2199
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,430
really care about. So first the import
is it didn't much matter but I wanted to

2200
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:13,440
is it didn't much matter but I wanted to
 

2201
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,069
is it didn't much matter but I wanted to
copy the derivation in the paper in case

2202
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:16,079
copy the derivation in the paper in case
 

2203
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,430
copy the derivation in the paper in case
you wanted to go back and read it in the

2204
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:17,440
you wanted to go back and read it in the
 

2205
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,309
you wanted to go back and read it in the
paper. That's the first thing. Second

2206
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:20,319
paper. That's the first thing. Second
 

2207
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,870
paper. That's the first thing. Second
thing is why was it a valid move and why

2208
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:22,880
thing is why was it a valid move and why
 

2209
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,710
thing is why was it a valid move and why
did you maybe want to do it is you maybe

2210
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:24,720
did you maybe want to do it is you maybe
 

2211
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,150
did you maybe want to do it is you maybe
wanted to get rid of all the delta t

2212
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:26,160
wanted to get rid of all the delta t
 

2213
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,270
wanted to get rid of all the delta t
dependence and make sure none of it's

2214
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280
dependence and make sure none of it's
 

2215
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,829
dependence and make sure none of it's
going to bite you

2216
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:29,839
going to bite you
 

2217
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,750
going to bite you
and that from that move's point of view

2218
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:31,760
and that from that move's point of view
 

2219
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,710
and that from that move's point of view
it was just saying that okay what is the

2220
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:34,720
it was just saying that okay what is the
 

2221
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,030
it was just saying that okay what is the
difference between pt minus delta t and

2222
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:37,040
difference between pt minus delta t and
 

2223
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,190
difference between pt minus delta t and
pt and the answer is something of order

2224
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:39,200
pt and the answer is something of order
 

2225
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,390
pt and the answer is something of order
delta t if pt is sufficiently smooth

2226
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:42,400
delta t if pt is sufficiently smooth
 

2227
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,430
delta t if pt is sufficiently smooth
sufficiently smooth in what in time why

2228
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
sufficiently smooth in what in time why
 

2229
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,030
sufficiently smooth in what in time why
should it be sufficiently smooth in time

2230
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:47,040
should it be sufficiently smooth in time
 

2231
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,549
should it be sufficiently smooth in time
because I'm convolving with a very small

2232
00:51:48,549 --> 00:51:48,559
because I'm convolving with a very small
 

2233
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,069
because I'm convolving with a very small
thing I'm doing a very little bit of

2234
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
thing I'm doing a very little bit of
 

2235
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,910
thing I'm doing a very little bit of
smoothing of this density. So, it's

2236
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:51,920
smoothing of this density. So, it's
 

2237
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,670
smoothing of this density. So, it's
probably smooth. Again, this is hand

2238
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:53,680
probably smooth. Again, this is hand
 

2239
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,349
probably smooth. Again, this is hand
wavy, but it's the ar it's the style of

2240
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:55,359
wavy, but it's the ar it's the style of
 

2241
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,790
wavy, but it's the ar it's the style of
the argument.

2242
00:51:58,790 --> 00:51:58,800

 

2243
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,549

>> Did that answer your question?

2244
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:00,559
>> Did that answer your question?
 

2245
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,150
>> Did that answer your question?
>> Yeah. I guess like we think about it

2246
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
>> Yeah. I guess like we think about it
 

2247
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,630
>> Yeah. I guess like we think about it
almost

2248
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:06,640

 

2249
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,150

like t

2250
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,160
like t
 

2251
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,589
like t
or x plus a little tiny x right in this

2252
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:13,599
or x plus a little tiny x right in this
 

2253
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,390
or x plus a little tiny x right in this
case it's like we're

2254
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:16,400
case it's like we're
 

2255
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,030
case it's like we're
instead of adding a little delta x delta

2256
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:19,040
instead of adding a little delta x delta
 

2257
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,910
instead of adding a little delta x delta
t minus delta t plus delta t exactly

2258
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:21,920
t minus delta t plus delta t exactly
 

2259
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,990
t minus delta t plus delta t exactly
yeah it's exactly this in a way this is

2260
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:24,000
yeah it's exactly this in a way this is
 

2261
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,309
yeah it's exactly this in a way this is
easier because delta t is a scalar I

2262
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:26,319
easier because delta t is a scalar I
 

2263
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,309
easier because delta t is a scalar I
mean scaler and x is a vector but it's

2264
00:52:28,309 --> 00:52:28,319
mean scaler and x is a vector but it's
 

2265
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,710
mean scaler and x is a vector but it's
the same

2266
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:30,720

 

2267
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,309

Okay. Um, last question then I want to

2268
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:32,319
Okay. Um, last question then I want to
 

2269
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,109
Okay. Um, last question then I want to
move on. Yeah.

2270
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:33,119
move on. Yeah.
 

2271
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,190
move on. Yeah.
>> Um, just from like a historical

2272
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,200
>> Um, just from like a historical
 

2273
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,270
>> Um, just from like a historical
perspective, was this like a known

2274
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,280
perspective, was this like a known
 

2275
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,430
perspective, was this like a known
result and then they made the models

2276
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:39,440
result and then they made the models
 

2277
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,109

based off this result or did they like
 

2279
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,710
based off this result or did they like

00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:44,720
derive this result while they were it?
 

2281
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,309
derive this result while they were it?
>> Oh, I will come back to this.

2282
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:46,319
>> Oh, I will come back to this.
 

2283
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:46,950
>> Oh, I will come back to this.
>> Okay,

2284
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:46,960
>> Okay,

00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,390
>> Okay,

>> let me let me let me first teach you
 

2287
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,510
>> let me let me let me first teach you
more and then I'll come back to this

2288
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:49,520
more and then I'll come back to this
 

2289
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,470
more and then I'll come back to this
historical perspective. I have a little

2290
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:50,480
historical perspective. I have a little
 

2291
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,230
historical perspective. I have a little
bit of historical perspective later, but

2292
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:52,240
bit of historical perspective later, but
 

2293
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,990
bit of historical perspective later, but
let me let me not dwell on the

2294
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,000
let me let me not dwell on the
 

2295
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,069
let me let me not dwell on the
historical perspective right now. Let me

2296
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079
historical perspective right now. Let me
 

2297
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,430
historical perspective right now. Let me
keep going. First I just want to make

2298
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:57,440
keep going. First I just want to make
 

2299
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,990
keep going. First I just want to make
sure that I can um talk about the

2300
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,000
sure that I can um talk about the
 

2301
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,430
sure that I can um talk about the
training side to this too. So you can

2302
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,440
training side to this too. So you can
 

2303
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,430
training side to this too. So you can
see the whole DDPM picture and then I

2304
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:03,440
see the whole DDPM picture and then I
 

2305
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,150
see the whole DDPM picture and then I
can uh show you how one can do something

2306
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:06,160
can uh show you how one can do something
 

2307
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,230
can uh show you how one can do something
very cool.

2308
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:08,240
very cool.
 

2309
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,870
very cool.
So now we have this idea that we want to

2310
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:10,880
So now we have this idea that we want to
 

2311
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,309
So now we have this idea that we want to
learn this mean. How do we train it?

2312
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:14,319
learn this mean. How do we train it?
 

2313
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,069
learn this mean. How do we train it?
So the way we train it and you saw this

2314
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:16,079
So the way we train it and you saw this
 

2315
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,470
So the way we train it and you saw this
in discussion already in the discrete

2316
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:18,480
in discussion already in the discrete
 

2317
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,870
in discussion already in the discrete
setting is you say I'm going to be doing

2318
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:20,880
setting is you say I'm going to be doing
 

2319
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,349
setting is you say I'm going to be doing
SGD type things. So I'm going to pick a

2320
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:23,359
SGD type things. So I'm going to pick a
 

2321
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,829
SGD type things. So I'm going to pick a
random image. You always think of it as

2322
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:25,839
random image. You always think of it as
 

2323
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,910
random image. You always think of it as
a vector, right? Some random vector for

2324
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:27,920
a vector, right? Some random vector for
 

2325
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,710
a vector, right? Some random vector for
my training set. I'll pick a random time

2326
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:30,720
my training set. I'll pick a random time
 

2327
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,510
my training set. I'll pick a random time
from 0 to one in continuous time. And

2328
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:33,520
from 0 to one in continuous time. And
 

2329
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,230
from 0 to one in continuous time. And
then I'll construct a pair Xt minus

2330
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:36,240
then I'll construct a pair Xt minus
 

2331
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,030
then I'll construct a pair Xt minus
delta t and xt.

2332
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:39,040
delta t and xt.
 

2333
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,309
delta t and xt.
Right? Because I want to learn the

2334
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,319
Right? Because I want to learn the
 

2335
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,829
Right? Because I want to learn the
conditional mean from here to here.

2336
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:43,839
conditional mean from here to here.
 

2337
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:45,910
conditional mean from here to here.
Right? I know these I think of these two

2338
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:45,920
Right? I know these I think of these two
 

2339
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,390
Right? I know these I think of these two
things as being approximately jointly

2340
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:48,400
things as being approximately jointly
 

2341
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,150
things as being approximately jointly
Gaussian

2342
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:50,160
Gaussian
 

2343
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,990
Gaussian
uh in their distribution. Right? Going

2344
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,000
uh in their distribution. Right? Going
 

2345
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,750
uh in their distribution. Right? Going
backward.

2346
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:53,760
backward.
 

2347
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,630
backward.
So how do I get this? Well, I can

2348
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:56,640
So how do I get this? Well, I can
 

2349
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,910
So how do I get this? Well, I can
definitely do this. I can just take X0

2350
00:53:59,910 --> 00:53:59,920
definitely do this. I can just take X0
 

2351
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,990
definitely do this. I can just take X0
and add noise to it.

2352
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,000
and add noise to it.
 

2353
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,069
and add noise to it.
And then having done that, I can add a

2354
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:06,079
And then having done that, I can add a
 

2355
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,030
And then having done that, I can add a
little bit more noise to get XT. So I

2356
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,040
little bit more noise to get XT. So I
 

2357
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,270
little bit more noise to get XT. So I
can generate these these pairs very

2358
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:11,280
can generate these these pairs very
 

2359
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,190
can generate these these pairs very
easily.

2360
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:13,200
easily.
 

2361
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,270
easily.
Everyone with me? This is the

2362
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,280
Everyone with me? This is the
 

2363
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,390
Everyone with me? This is the
counterpart of what you saw in

2364
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:16,400
counterpart of what you saw in
 

2365
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,150
counterpart of what you saw in
discussion of saying that if you wanted

2366
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:18,160
discussion of saying that if you wanted
 

2367
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,790
discussion of saying that if you wanted
to get a pair for your pixels with bit

2368
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:20,800
to get a pair for your pixels with bit
 

2369
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,270
to get a pair for your pixels with bit
flipping is you just choose a different

2370
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,280
flipping is you just choose a different
 

2371
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,430
flipping is you just choose a different
probability of flipping and then do a

2372
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:25,440
probability of flipping and then do a
 

2373
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,910
probability of flipping and then do a
tiny flip from there. Right? That's we

2374
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:27,920
tiny flip from there. Right? That's we
 

2375
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,349
tiny flip from there. Right? That's we
saw in discussion. Same thing here.

2376
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:31,359
saw in discussion. Same thing here.
 

2377
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,910
saw in discussion. Same thing here.
And now I want to basically predict

2378
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:33,920
And now I want to basically predict
 

2379
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,190
And now I want to basically predict
this. This is my target

2380
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:37,200
this. This is my target
 

2381
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,510
this. This is my target
and this is my input

2382
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:41,520

 

2383
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,589

and I want to predict it and I believe

2384
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:43,599
and I want to predict it and I believe
 

2385
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,190
and I want to predict it and I believe
it to be Gaussian. So what's the loss

2386
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,200
it to be Gaussian. So what's the loss
 

2387
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,190
it to be Gaussian. So what's the loss
you use for predicting a Gaussian

2388
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:47,200
you use for predicting a Gaussian
 

2389
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,910
you use for predicting a Gaussian
squared loss,

2390
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:49,920
squared loss,
 

2391
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,109
squared loss,
right? Because you know I know the

2392
00:54:51,109 --> 00:54:51,119
right? Because you know I know the
 

2393
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,630
right? Because you know I know the
Gaussian I also know its variance is

2394
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:52,640
Gaussian I also know its variance is
 

2395
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,589
Gaussian I also know its variance is
isotropic sigma square identity.

2396
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:55,599
isotropic sigma square identity.
 

2397
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,790
isotropic sigma square identity.
So great

2398
00:54:58,790 --> 00:54:58,800
So great
 

2399
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,030
So great
isotropic Gaussian

2400
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:01,040
isotropic Gaussian
 

2401
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,910
isotropic Gaussian
is straight up squared loss. So I just

2402
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:03,920
is straight up squared loss. So I just
 

2403
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,870
is straight up squared loss. So I just
do this with squared loss and that's how

2404
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:06,880
do this with squared loss and that's how
 

2405
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,870
do this with squared loss and that's how
I train. Of course this is not how you

2406
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:08,880
I train. Of course this is not how you
 

2407
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,390
I train. Of course this is not how you
actually train and I'll talk about that

2408
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:10,400
actually train and I'll talk about that
 

2409
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,790
actually train and I'll talk about that
in a moment but this conceptually gives

2410
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:12,800
in a moment but this conceptually gives
 

2411
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,750
in a moment but this conceptually gives
you a way to train.

2412
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:17,760

 

2413
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,670

So here is all that written out in code

2414
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:19,680
So here is all that written out in code
 

2415
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,630
So here is all that written out in code
from figure from the paper. This

2416
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:22,640
from figure from the paper. This

from figure from the paper. This
algorithm is in the code in the in the

00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:25,280
algorithm is in the code in the in the
 

2419
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,870

paper described this way. It's like the

2420
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:26,880
paper described this way. It's like the
 

2421
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,430
paper described this way. It's like the
same thing. sample, pick a time from

2422
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:29,440
same thing. sample, pick a time from

They use for the neural net um f theta
and it takes two arguments. It has to

2430
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:42,559
and it takes two arguments. It has to
 

2431
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,030
and it takes two arguments. It has to
know what time it is.

2432
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:45,040
know what time it is.
 

2433
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,789
know what time it is.
Okay, so it knows the time

2434
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:48,799
Okay, so it knows the time
 

2435
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,870
Okay, so it knows the time

Thank you.
That's just me

that bug.
So this is how DDPM works. But now we

2476
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:57,280
So this is how DDPM works. But now we
 

2477
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,990
So this is how DDPM works. But now we
can think about this a little bit more.

2478
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:00,000
can think about this a little bit more.
 

2479
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,190
can think about this a little bit more.
So let's think about it a little bit

2480
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,200
So let's think about it a little bit
 

2481
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,789
So let's think about it a little bit
more.

2482
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:04,799

 

2483
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,510

In all of this, the thing we wanted was

2484
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:07,520
In all of this, the thing we wanted was
 

2485
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,349
In all of this, the thing we wanted was
the mean,

2486
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:09,359
the mean,
 

2487
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,309
the mean,
right? So this mu t that we were

2488
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:12,319
right? So this mu t that we were
 

2489
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:16,630
right? So this mu t that we were
learning is supposed to be this mean.

2490
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:16,640
learning is supposed to be this mean.
 

2491
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,589
learning is supposed to be this mean.
Everyone good with this?

2492
00:57:19,589 --> 00:57:19,599
Everyone good with this?
 

2493
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,349
Everyone good with this?
So now let's think about what this mean

2494
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:21,359
So now let's think about what this mean
 

2495
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,349
So now let's think about what this mean
is.

2496
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:23,359
is.
 

2497
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,789
is.
And this is coming to the question about

2498
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:24,799
And this is coming to the question about
 

2499
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:27,190
And this is coming to the question about
subtractions. So I want to get I'm going

2500
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,200
subtractions. So I want to get I'm going
 

2501
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,150
subtractions. So I want to get I'm going
to talk about this question that was

2502
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:28,160
to talk about this question that was
 

2503
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,150
to talk about this question that was
asked earlier about subtractions. So

2504
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:32,160
asked earlier about subtractions. So
 

2505
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,349
asked earlier about subtractions. So
I can think about

2506
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:35,359
I can think about
 

2507
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:39,910
I can think about
XT minus delta t as being xt minus delta

2508
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:39,920
XT minus delta t as being xt minus delta
 

2509
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,789
XT minus delta t as being xt minus delta
t minus xt.

2510
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:42,799
t minus xt.
 

2511
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,270
t minus xt.
This is condition on xt. So I can write

2512
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,280
This is condition on xt. So I can write
 

2513
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,109
This is condition on xt. So I can write
this as equaling this plus this.

2514
00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:49,119
this as equaling this plus this.
 

2515
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,390
this as equaling this plus this.
It's like a nonmove. It's just a and now

2516
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:52,400
It's like a nonmove. It's just a and now
 

2517
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,870
It's like a nonmove. It's just a and now
you can see that the thing I have xt

2518
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:54,880
you can see that the thing I have xt
 

2519
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,349
you can see that the thing I have xt
already. The thing I don't know is the

2520
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:57,359
already. The thing I don't know is the
 

2521
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,349
already. The thing I don't know is the
noise. This is the negative of the

2522
00:57:59,349 --> 00:57:59,359
noise. This is the negative of the
 

2523
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,069
noise. This is the negative of the
noise.

2524
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:02,079
noise.
 

2525
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:07,190
noise.
Okay.

2526
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,200

 

2527
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,950

And so this is where you might see the

2528
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:08,960
And so this is where you might see the
 

2529
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,190
And so this is where you might see the
perspective if you read other works on

2530
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:11,200
perspective if you read other works on
 

2531
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,670
perspective if you read other works on
diffusion um talking about what you're

2532
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,680
diffusion um talking about what you're
 

2533
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,589
diffusion um talking about what you're
trying to learn is how to predict the

2534
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:15,599
trying to learn is how to predict the
 

2535
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,870
trying to learn is how to predict the
noise to d noiseise.

2536
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:18,880
noise to d noiseise.
 

2537
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,510
noise to d noiseise.
Okay, this is where that comes from. It

2538
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:21,520
Okay, this is where that comes from. It
 

2539
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,589
Okay, this is where that comes from. It
says I can think of this as being

2540
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:25,599
says I can think of this as being
 

2541
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,870
says I can think of this as being
mu minus xt is just the expected

2542
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:28,880
mu minus xt is just the expected
 

2543
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,589
mu minus xt is just the expected
negative noise.

2544
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:31,599
negative noise.
 

2545
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,150
negative noise.
But there's a key thing here.

2546
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:34,160
But there's a key thing here.
 

2547
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,430
But there's a key thing here.
What you want mutus XT to be is the

2548
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:37,440
What you want mutus XT to be is the
 

2549
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,109
What you want mutus XT to be is the
expected negative noise, not the actual

2550
00:58:41,109 --> 00:58:41,119
expected negative noise, not the actual
 

2551
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,750
expected negative noise, not the actual
negative noise.

2552
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:45,760

 

2553
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,710

Okay, there's a little difference.

2554
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:48,720
Okay, there's a little difference.
 

2555
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,309
Okay, there's a little difference.
You can think, well, what difference is

2556
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:50,319
You can think, well, what difference is
 

2557
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,470
You can think, well, what difference is
there? I love the actual negative noise.

2558
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:52,480
there? I love the actual negative noise.
 

2559
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,990
there? I love the actual negative noise.
The only thing I can get ever is the

2560
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:54,000
The only thing I can get ever is the
 

2561
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,109
The only thing I can get ever is the
expectation. So, I'm getting the

2562
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:55,119
expectation. So, I'm getting the
 

2563
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,990
expectation. So, I'm getting the
expectation. But for the purposes of

2564
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
expectation. But for the purposes of
 

2565
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,510
expectation. But for the purposes of
doing the generation, it was the

2566
00:58:59,510 --> 00:58:59,520
doing the generation, it was the
 

2567
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,670
doing the generation, it was the
expectation. That's how we had to keep

2568
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:01,680
expectation. That's how we had to keep
 

2569
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,950
expectation. That's how we had to keep
adding the noise because all we had was

2570
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
adding the noise because all we had was
 

2571
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,630
adding the noise because all we had was
the expectation to run the reverse

2572
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:04,640
the expectation to run the reverse
 

2573
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,270
the expectation to run the reverse
process. In the homework, we will have

2574
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:07,280
process. In the homework, we will have
 

2575
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,670
process. In the homework, we will have
you run

2576
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:09,680
you run
 

2577
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,870
you run
manually by hand. What happens if you

2578
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:12,880
manually by hand. What happens if you
 

2579
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,190
manually by hand. What happens if you
don't do that? Don't add noise. And you

2580
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:15,200
don't do that? Don't add noise. And you
 

2581
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,270
don't do that? Don't add noise. And you
will see what happens. If you don't add

2582
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:17,280
will see what happens. If you don't add
 

2583
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,349
will see what happens. If you don't add
the noise, you will collapse. It will

2584
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:19,359
the noise, you will collapse. It will
 

2585
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,750
the noise, you will collapse. It will
not generate something nice. It'll just

2586
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:21,760
not generate something nice. It'll just
 

2587
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,109
not generate something nice. It'll just
pull in to zero.

2588
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:25,119
pull in to zero.
 

2589
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,870
pull in to zero.
Okay.

2590
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:26,880
Okay.
 

2591
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,150
Okay.
So, that's the first thing you can do.

2592
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:28,160
So, that's the first thing you can do.
 

2593
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,910
So, that's the first thing you can do.
Yeah.

2594
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:29,920
Yeah.
 

2595
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,990
Yeah.
Does the randomness or is it just

2596
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,000
Does the randomness or is it just
 

2597
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,630
Does the randomness or is it just
function?

2598
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:34,640
function?
 

2599
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,109
function?
>> Oh, f theta is a neural net is a is is

2600
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,119
>> Oh, f theta is a neural net is a is is
 

2601
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,549
>> Oh, f theta is a neural net is a is is
you can think of it as a deep neural net

2602
00:59:38,549 --> 00:59:38,559
you can think of it as a deep neural net
 

2603
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,829
you can think of it as a deep neural net
with no randomness.

2604
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:41,839
with no randomness.
 

2605
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,230
with no randomness.
>> Yeah. F if this literally f okay let me

2606
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:44,240
>> Yeah. F if this literally f okay let me
 

2607
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,789
>> Yeah. F if this literally f okay let me
I'll write that out point write on

2608
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:46,799
I'll write that out point write on
 

2609
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:50,069
I'll write that out point write on
annotate the note accordingly. This is

2610
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:50,079
annotate the note accordingly. This is
 

2611
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:59,349
annotate the note accordingly. This is
just

2612
00:59:59,349 --> 00:59:59,359

 

2613
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,230

this is what they call it in the paper.

2614
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:02,240
this is what they call it in the paper.
 

2615
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,510
this is what they call it in the paper.
The paper goes back and forth between

2616
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:03,520
The paper goes back and forth between
 

2617
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,589
The paper goes back and forth between
calling mut and calling it f theta. Call

2618
01:00:05,589 --> 01:00:05,599
calling mut and calling it f theta. Call
 

2619
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,030
calling mut and calling it f theta. Call
it f theta when you want to remind you

2620
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:07,040
it f theta when you want to remind you
 

2621
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,470
it f theta when you want to remind you
that there's parameters associated with

2622
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:08,480
that there's parameters associated with
 

2623
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,990
that there's parameters associated with
it.

2624
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:10,000
it.
 

2625
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,109
it.
Okay, that's just all it is. It's

2626
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:11,119
Okay, that's just all it is. It's
 

2627
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,829
Okay, that's just all it is. It's
literally just mut.

2628
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:13,839
literally just mut.
 

2629
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:17,670
literally just mut.
Okay. So now

2630
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:17,680

 

2631
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,829

now comes the so if you remember in

2632
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:19,839
now comes the so if you remember in
 

2633
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,710
now comes the so if you remember in
discussion the last thing in discussion

2634
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:22,720
discussion the last thing in discussion
 

2635
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,470
discussion the last thing in discussion
was telling you so what is it you're

2636
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:24,480
was telling you so what is it you're
 

2637
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,789
was telling you so what is it you're
trying to predict and if you read the

2638
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:26,799
trying to predict and if you read the
 

2639
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,150
trying to predict and if you read the
solution we post the solutions

2640
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,160
solution we post the solutions
 

2641
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,270
solution we post the solutions
discussion I don't know if we posted the

2642
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,280
discussion I don't know if we posted the
 

2643
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,870
discussion I don't know if we posted the
solution discussion yet if we haven't we

2644
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:30,880
solution discussion yet if we haven't we
 

2645
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,309
solution discussion yet if we haven't we
should we'll post it soon um what that

2646
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
should we'll post it soon um what that
 

2647
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,829
should we'll post it soon um what that
kale divergence of what you're trying to

2648
01:00:35,829 --> 01:00:35,839
kale divergence of what you're trying to
 

2649
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,990
kale divergence of what you're trying to
predict can also be interpreted as

2650
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:38,000
predict can also be interpreted as
 

2651
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,349
predict can also be interpreted as
actually predicting the original image

2652
01:00:41,349 --> 01:00:41,359
actually predicting the original image
 

2653
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,750
actually predicting the original image
right in discussion and so

2654
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:43,760
right in discussion and so
 

2655
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,750
right in discussion and so
that interpretation isn't visible here.

2656
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:45,760
that interpretation isn't visible here.
 

2657
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,510
that interpretation isn't visible here.
I want to get you that interpretation

2658
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
I want to get you that interpretation
 

2659
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,829
I want to get you that interpretation
here because that's useful for actually

2660
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:49,839
here because that's useful for actually
 

2661
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,150
here because that's useful for actually
training.

2662
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:52,160
training.
 

2663
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,430
training.
So the thing is that we did all of this

2664
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:55,440
So the thing is that we did all of this
 

2665
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,069
So the thing is that we did all of this
and we added a bunch of noise but all

2666
01:00:58,069 --> 01:00:58,079
and we added a bunch of noise but all
 

2667
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,230
and we added a bunch of noise but all
the noise in this picture that we added

2668
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
the noise in this picture that we added
 

2669
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,630
the noise in this picture that we added
was iid. We added a bunch of iid noise.

2670
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:04,640
was iid. We added a bunch of iid noise.
 

2671
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,309
was iid. We added a bunch of iid noise.
And you can think of it as okay I'm

2672
01:01:08,309 --> 01:01:08,319
And you can think of it as okay I'm
 

2673
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:12,549
And you can think of it as okay I'm
asking you to predict the expected

2674
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:12,559
asking you to predict the expected
 

2675
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,710
asking you to predict the expected
uh expected last term of the ID noise

2676
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:16,720
uh expected last term of the ID noise
 

2677
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,069
uh expected last term of the ID noise
but all you have is where you ended up

2678
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,079
but all you have is where you ended up
 

2679
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,710
but all you have is where you ended up
okay does everyone see that like and

2680
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:24,720
okay does everyone see that like and
 

2681
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,829
okay does everyone see that like and
you're asked to predict the expected

2682
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:27,839
you're asked to predict the expected
 

2683
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:31,190
you're asked to predict the expected
last noise term that got you here but

2684
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
last noise term that got you here but
 

2685
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,510
last noise term that got you here but
the last noise term was the same

2686
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:33,520
the last noise term was the same
 

2687
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,109
the last noise term was the same
distribution as all the other noise

2688
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:35,119
distribution as all the other noise
 

2689
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,069
distribution as all the other noise
terms. So, this answer has to be the

2690
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:38,079
terms. So, this answer has to be the
 

2691
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:39,750
terms. So, this answer has to be the
same answer. If you ask me to predict

2692
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:39,760
same answer. If you ask me to predict
 

2693
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,230
same answer. If you ask me to predict
the third noise term or the 17th, it

2694
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,240
the third noise term or the 17th, it
 

2695
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,670
the third noise term or the 17th, it
doesn't matter which one you ask me to

2696
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:45,680
doesn't matter which one you ask me to
 

2697
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,789
doesn't matter which one you ask me to
predict. They're all identically

2698
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:46,799
predict. They're all identically
 

2699
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,950
predict. They're all identically
distributed and they all just added up

2700
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:48,960
distributed and they all just added up
 

2701
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,589
distributed and they all just added up
to get me where I am. I have no way of

2702
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:51,599
to get me where I am. I have no way of
 

2703
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:52,950
to get me where I am. I have no way of
disentangling them. Does everyone see

2704
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:52,960
disentangling them. Does everyone see
 

2705
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,829
disentangling them. Does everyone see
that as the intuition? So, how can we

2706
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:55,839
that as the intuition? So, how can we
 

2707
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,829
that as the intuition? So, how can we
turn that intuition into something

2708
01:01:57,829 --> 01:01:57,839
turn that intuition into something
 

2709
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,510
turn that intuition into something
mathematical that we can take advantage

2710
01:01:59,510 --> 01:01:59,520
mathematical that we can take advantage
 

2711
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,230
mathematical that we can take advantage
of during training?

2712
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:02,240
of during training?
 

2713
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,990
of during training?
And so it says, okay,

2714
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,000
And so it says, okay,
 

2715
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,470
And so it says, okay,
let me look at all the noise. Here's all

2716
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:08,480
let me look at all the noise. Here's all
 

2717
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,430
let me look at all the noise. Here's all
the noise.

2718
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
the noise.
 

2719
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,910
the noise.
The expectation for the last noise term

2720
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:13,920
The expectation for the last noise term
 

2721
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,990
The expectation for the last noise term
is just how many noise terms were there,

2722
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:18,000
is just how many noise terms were there,
 

2723
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,829
is just how many noise terms were there,
right? One over that of the prediction

2724
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:21,839
right? One over that of the prediction
 

2725
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,630
right? One over that of the prediction
of the entire noise term because all the

2726
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:24,640
of the entire noise term because all the
 

2727
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,390
of the entire noise term because all the
noise terms are identical from my point

2728
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:26,400
noise terms are identical from my point
 

2729
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,950
noise terms are identical from my point
of view. I'm only observing XD.

2730
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:28,960
of view. I'm only observing XD.
 

2731
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,630
of view. I'm only observing XD.
asking me to predict any one of them is

2732
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:30,640
asking me to predict any one of them is
 

2733
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,470
asking me to predict any one of them is
the same. So I might as well predict

2734
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:32,480
the same. So I might as well predict
 

2735
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,549
the same. So I might as well predict
their entire sum and divide by the

2736
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:34,559
their entire sum and divide by the
 

2737
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,670
their entire sum and divide by the
number of them. It's the same thing in

2738
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680
number of them. It's the same thing in
 

2739
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,670
number of them. It's the same thing in
terms of expectations.

2740
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:39,680
terms of expectations.
 

2741
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:44,470
terms of expectations.
Okay. And that's what this is saying.

2742
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:44,480

 

2743
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,630

Okay. Now what's nice about this? What's

2744
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:48,640
Okay. Now what's nice about this? What's
 

2745
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,109
Okay. Now what's nice about this? What's
nice about this is you can think about

2746
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
nice about this is you can think about
 

2747
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,430
nice about this is you can think about
this as predicting learning. Remember

2748
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:53,440
this as predicting learning. Remember
 

2749
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,829
this as predicting learning. Remember
every time you see an expectation as the

2750
01:02:55,829 --> 01:02:55,839
every time you see an expectation as the
 

2751
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,589
every time you see an expectation as the
thing you're trying to target from the

2752
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:57,599
thing you're trying to target from the
 

2753
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,230
thing you're trying to target from the
point of view of machine learning

2754
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:00,240
point of view of machine learning
 

2755
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,109
point of view of machine learning
this guy is going to be the target this

2756
01:03:03,109 --> 01:03:03,119
this guy is going to be the target this
 

2757
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,789
this guy is going to be the target this
is going to be the input and because

2758
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:04,799
is going to be the input and because
 

2759
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,870
is going to be the input and because
everything is Gaussian squared loss is

2760
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:06,880
everything is Gaussian squared loss is
 

2761
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,109
everything is Gaussian squared loss is
going to be your loss

2762
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:09,119
going to be your loss
 

2763
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,270
going to be your loss
okay so this says great I can just

2764
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:13,280
okay so this says great I can just
 

2765
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,270
okay so this says great I can just
predict xn not so here's a little

2766
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:15,280
predict xn not so here's a little
 

2767
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,710
predict xn not so here's a little
picture again of this symmetry

2768
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,720
picture again of this symmetry
 

2769
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,069
picture again of this symmetry
um that from from the from the paper

2770
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:22,079
um that from from the from the paper
 

2771
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,910
um that from from the from the paper
just you You wandered somehow and got

2772
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:23,920
just you You wandered somehow and got
 

2773
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,430
just you You wandered somehow and got
here, but you have no all you know is

2774
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
here, but you have no all you know is
 

2775
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,870
here, but you have no all you know is
that you moved this entire direction.

2776
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,880
that you moved this entire direction.
 

2777
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,390
that you moved this entire direction.
So this perspective lets you do the

2778
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,400
So this perspective lets you do the
 

2779
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,309
So this perspective lets you do the
training for mu here as though you're

2780
01:03:36,309 --> 01:03:36,319
training for mu here as though you're
 

2781
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:39,270
training for mu here as though you're
predicting the original image or

2782
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:39,280
predicting the original image or
 

2783
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,150
predicting the original image or
alternatively the net noise from the

2784
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,160
alternatively the net noise from the
 

2785
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:47,349
alternatively the net noise from the
original image to where I am now.

2786
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:47,359

 

2787
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:51,190

So this particular idea

2788
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:51,200
So this particular idea
 

2789
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,029
So this particular idea
again you can like think of it this way

2790
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:53,039
again you can like think of it this way
 

2791
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,990
again you can like think of it this way
the this particular idea actually makes

2792
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:56,000
the this particular idea actually makes
 

2793
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,589
the this particular idea actually makes
training work much better.

2794
01:03:59,589 --> 01:03:59,599
training work much better.
 

2795
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,510
training work much better.
It's mathematically equivalent but makes

2796
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:01,520
It's mathematically equivalent but makes
 

2797
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,150
It's mathematically equivalent but makes
training work much better. Why? Because

2798
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:04,160
training work much better. Why? Because
 

2799
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,309
training work much better. Why? Because
now your target, if you think about this

2800
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:06,319
now your target, if you think about this
 

2801
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:09,670
now your target, if you think about this
thing as being predict xnot, your target

2802
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:09,680
thing as being predict xnot, your target
 

2803
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,710
thing as being predict xnot, your target
is actually an image.

2804
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:12,720
is actually an image.
 

2805
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,270
is actually an image.
And you've made conets and units and

2806
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:15,280
And you've made conets and units and
 

2807
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,870
And you've made conets and units and
stuff like this that are designed to

2808
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:16,880
stuff like this that are designed to
 

2809
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,630
stuff like this that are designed to
have the inductive bias of making things

2810
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:18,640
have the inductive bias of making things
 

2811
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,670
have the inductive bias of making things
that are like images as opposed to

2812
01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:21,680
that are like images as opposed to
 

2813
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,069
that are like images as opposed to
making noise.

2814
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:24,079
making noise.
 

2815
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,390
making noise.
Do you see that? So by having your

2816
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:26,400
Do you see that? So by having your
 

2817
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,150
Do you see that? So by having your
prediction target be something that

2818
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:28,160
prediction target be something that
 

2819
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,190
prediction target be something that
looks like an image is nice from this

2820
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:31,200
looks like an image is nice from this
 

2821
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,069
looks like an image is nice from this
mechanical point of view. you built all

2822
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:34,079
mechanical point of view. you built all
 

2823
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,750
mechanical point of view. you built all
this machinery for working with images

2824
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:35,760
this machinery for working with images
 

2825
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,829
this machinery for working with images
and generating images and things like

2826
01:04:37,829 --> 01:04:37,839
and generating images and things like
 

2827
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,430
and generating images and things like
that.

2828
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:39,440
that.
 

2829
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,829
that.
So that's one perspective and another

2830
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:41,839
So that's one perspective and another
 

2831
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,549
So that's one perspective and another
more mathematical perspective is that

2832
01:04:44,549 --> 01:04:44,559
more mathematical perspective is that
 

2833
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:48,470
more mathematical perspective is that
there's this this net noise you can

2834
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:48,480
there's this this net noise you can
 

2835
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,829
there's this this net noise you can
think of as having less variance in it

2836
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:51,839
think of as having less variance in it
 

2837
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:55,829
think of as having less variance in it
than one term scaled up because there's

2838
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:55,839
than one term scaled up because there's
 

2839
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,309
than one term scaled up because there's
lots of noise added together. So it's a

2840
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:58,319
lots of noise added together. So it's a
 

2841
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,109
lots of noise added together. So it's a
little bit more stable than

2842
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:01,119
little bit more stable than
 

2843
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,710
little bit more stable than
just one noise. That turns out to be

2844
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:02,720
just one noise. That turns out to be
 

2845
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,990
just one noise. That turns out to be
mathematically you can work that out

2846
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,000
mathematically you can work that out
 

2847
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,470
mathematically you can work that out
mathemat as a another way of thinking

2848
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,480
mathemat as a another way of thinking
 

2849
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,150
mathemat as a another way of thinking
about what's happening. Intuitively it's

2850
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:08,160
about what's happening. Intuitively it's
 

2851
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,430
about what's happening. Intuitively it's
much easier to think of it is now I can

2852
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
much easier to think of it is now I can
 

2853
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,589
much easier to think of it is now I can
predict an image as opposed to having to

2854
01:05:11,589 --> 01:05:11,599
predict an image as opposed to having to
 

2855
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,510
predict an image as opposed to having to
predict a noise.

2856
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:15,520

 

2857
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,349

Okay. So what that does is this now

2858
01:05:19,349 --> 01:05:19,359
Okay. So what that does is this now
 

2859
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,109
Okay. So what that does is this now
connects you. So if you go and read any

2860
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
connects you. So if you go and read any
 

2861
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,390
connects you. So if you go and read any
of the uh blogs or papers about

2862
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:24,400
of the uh blogs or papers about
 

2863
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,029
of the uh blogs or papers about
diffusion models, this should help you

2864
01:05:27,029 --> 01:05:27,039
diffusion models, this should help you
 

2865
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,630
diffusion models, this should help you
understand what they're doing. There's

2866
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:28,640
understand what they're doing. There's
 

2867
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,069
understand what they're doing. There's
going to be some differences in what

2868
01:05:30,069 --> 01:05:30,079
going to be some differences in what
 

2869
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:32,069
going to be some differences in what
they do. Most of them are going to

2870
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:32,079
they do. Most of them are going to
 

2871
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,990
they do. Most of them are going to
follow the original style

2872
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:36,000
follow the original style
 

2873
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,069
follow the original style
which is um this style

2874
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:40,079
which is um this style
 

2875
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,670
which is um this style
which is what you have to do in practice

2876
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:41,680
which is what you have to do in practice
 

2877
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,510
which is what you have to do in practice
for implementation because you can't let

2878
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
for implementation because you can't let
 

2879
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,069
for implementation because you can't let
things variances get bigger and bigger.

2880
01:05:46,069 --> 01:05:46,079
things variances get bigger and bigger.
 

2881
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,910
things variances get bigger and bigger.
But conceptually

2882
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:47,920
But conceptually
 

2883
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,309
But conceptually
it's easier to understand this as an

2884
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:50,319
it's easier to understand this as an
 

2885
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:51,910
it's easier to understand this as an
approximation to what we just talked

2886
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:51,920
approximation to what we just talked
 

2887
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,150
approximation to what we just talked
about than to understand this directly

2888
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:56,160
about than to understand this directly
 

2889
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,870
about than to understand this directly
which is what so historically this

2890
01:05:58,870 --> 01:05:58,880
which is what so historically this
 

2891
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,190
which is what so historically this
development of this way of understanding

2892
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,200
development of this way of understanding
 

2893
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,029
development of this way of understanding
came much after the original development

2894
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:05,039
came much after the original development
 

2895
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,750
came much after the original development
of how they analyzed this thing. This is

2896
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:07,760
of how they analyzed this thing. This is
 

2897
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,029
of how they analyzed this thing. This is
a much cleaner crisper getting at the

2898
01:06:11,029 --> 01:06:11,039
a much cleaner crisper getting at the
 

2899
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,549
a much cleaner crisper getting at the
essence of what's actually happening

2900
01:06:12,549 --> 01:06:12,559
essence of what's actually happening
 

2901
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,390
essence of what's actually happening
picture than the picture in the original

2902
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:14,400
picture than the picture in the original
 

2903
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,870
picture than the picture in the original
papers.

2904
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,880

 

2905
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:23,430

which is why we're following it.

2906
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:23,440

 

2907
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,549

So,

2908
01:06:28,549 --> 01:06:28,559

 

2909
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,150

any questions on DDPM?

2910
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:32,160
any questions on DDPM?
 

2911
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,829
any questions on DDPM?
You kind of should understand roughly

2912
01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:33,839
You kind of should understand roughly
 

2913
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,190
You kind of should understand roughly
what's happening here. Now, I want to go

2914
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:37,200
what's happening here. Now, I want to go
 

2915
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,670
what's happening here. Now, I want to go
to what seems a bit mysterious. Yeah, go

2916
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:39,680
to what seems a bit mysterious. Yeah, go
 

2917
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,510
to what seems a bit mysterious. Yeah, go
ahead. So it seems like what the kind of

2918
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:43,520
ahead. So it seems like what the kind of
 

2919
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,029
ahead. So it seems like what the kind of
the flow of the argument that we've had

2920
01:06:45,029 --> 01:06:45,039
the flow of the argument that we've had
 

2921
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,190
the flow of the argument that we've had
so far from what I understand is like

2922
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:47,200
so far from what I understand is like
 

2923
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,870
so far from what I understand is like
we're learning some sort of stocastic

2924
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:48,880
we're learning some sort of stocastic
 

2925
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,349
we're learning some sort of stocastic
process which when you run it forward

01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:51,359
process which when you run it forward
 

2927
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:54,870
process which when you run it forward
maps from any sample to the manifold of

I feel like I'm confused about. One of

2962
01:07:25,109 --> 01:07:25,119
I feel like I'm confused about. One of
 

2963
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,630
I feel like I'm confused about. One of
them is you had mentioned that it's

2964
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:26,640
them is you had mentioned that it's
 

2965
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,309
them is you had mentioned that it's
necessary for that to be stocastic like

2966
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:28,319
necessary for that to be stocastic like
 

2967
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,710
necessary for that to be stocastic like
for it to have some noise because to me

2968
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:30,720
for it to have some noise because to me
 

2969
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,990
for it to have some noise because to me
like if I was thinking about this nally

2970
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:32,000
like if I was thinking about this nally
 

2971
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,750
like if I was thinking about this nally
I'd be like why not just learn that

2972
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:33,760
I'd be like why not just learn that
 

2973
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,670
I'd be like why not just learn that
directly? Why learn as a stocastic

2974
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:35,680
directly? Why learn as a stocastic
 

2975
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,309
directly? Why learn as a stocastic
process? Yes. And second

2976
01:07:38,309 --> 01:07:38,319
process? Yes. And second
 

2977
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,870
process? Yes. And second
I guess kind of like related to that is

2978
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880
I guess kind of like related to that is
 

2979
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,270
I guess kind of like related to that is
um actually let's just start there. I

2980
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:43,280
um actually let's just start there. I
 

2981
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:43,910
um actually let's just start there. I
don't have it.

2982
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:43,920
don't have it.
 

2983
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,829
don't have it.
>> Yeah. So that's actually the exact point

2984
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:45,839
>> Yeah. So that's actually the exact point
 

2985
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:46,710
>> Yeah. So that's actually the exact point
I want to get to.

2986
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:46,720
I want to get to.
 

2987
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,029
I want to get to.
>> Okay.

2988
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:47,039
>> Okay.
 

2989
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,430
>> Okay.
>> Is to say that you know the intuition

2990
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
>> Is to say that you know the intuition
 

2991
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,349
>> Is to say that you know the intuition
behind this is that we started somewhere

2992
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
behind this is that we started somewhere
 

2993
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,109
behind this is that we started somewhere
and we wanted to get ourselves onto the

2994
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:53,119
and we wanted to get ourselves onto the
 

2995
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,029
and we wanted to get ourselves onto the
manifold of natural whatevers. And we

2996
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:57,039
manifold of natural whatevers. And we
 

2997
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,349
manifold of natural whatevers. And we
set up the process of filling out the

2998
01:07:59,349 --> 01:07:59,359
set up the process of filling out the
 

2999
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,510
set up the process of filling out the
entire space for training as by as a

3000
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:01,520
entire space for training as by as a
 

3001
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,910
entire space for training as by as a
diffusion. And then we said, okay, if we

3002
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:03,920
diffusion. And then we said, okay, if we
 

3003
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,309
diffusion. And then we said, okay, if we
wanted to run that process in reverse,

3004
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:06,319
wanted to run that process in reverse,
 

3005
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,710
wanted to run that process in reverse,
we would have to be doing a time varying

3006
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:08,720
we would have to be doing a time varying
 

3007
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:10,470
we would have to be doing a time varying
diffusion.

3008
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:10,480
diffusion.
 

3009
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,829
diffusion.
But we didn't really want to do a

3010
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:11,839
But we didn't really want to do a
 

3011
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,829
But we didn't really want to do a
diffusion. We just wanted to get there.

3012
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:13,839
diffusion. We just wanted to get there.
 

3013
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:14,950
diffusion. We just wanted to get there.
So is there a way to do it

3014
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:14,960
So is there a way to do it
 

3015
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,789
So is there a way to do it
deterministically?

3016
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:16,799
deterministically?
 

3017
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,070
deterministically?
We need some randomness. So we

3018
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:18,080
We need some randomness. So we
 

3019
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:18,950
We need some randomness. So we
definitely have to pick the initial

3020
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:18,960
definitely have to pick the initial
 

3021
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,950
definitely have to pick the initial
condition randomly somehow. But can we

3022
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:20,960
condition randomly somehow. But can we
 

3023
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,269
condition randomly somehow. But can we
like do the rest without randomness?

3024
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:23,279
like do the rest without randomness?
 

3025
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,390
like do the rest without randomness?
That's what we're going to try to

3026
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:24,400
That's what we're going to try to
 

3027
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,189
That's what we're going to try to
understand next.

3028
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:25,199
understand next.
 

3029
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:26,870
understand next.
>> Yeah. And it seems like that the final

3030
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:26,880
>> Yeah. And it seems like that the final
 

3031
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,229
>> Yeah. And it seems like that the final
result that you just talked about is a

3032
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:28,239
result that you just talked about is a
 

3033
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,510
result that you just talked about is a
very strong hint in that direction,

3034
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:29,520
very strong hint in that direction,
 

3035
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,829
very strong hint in that direction,
which is that actually

3036
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:31,839
which is that actually
 

3037
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,669
which is that actually
like predicting the original image is

3038
01:08:33,669 --> 01:08:33,679
like predicting the original image is
 

3039
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:34,630
like predicting the original image is
actually what you want to do, right?

3040
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:34,640
actually what you want to do, right?
 

3041
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,430
actually what you want to do, right?
Because when you're predicting the

3042
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:35,440
Because when you're predicting the
 

3043
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,630
Because when you're predicting the
noise, you're learning the noise and

3044
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:36,640
noise, you're learning the noise and
 

3045
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,149
noise, you're learning the noise and
then that's

3046
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:38,159
then that's
 

3047
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:39,189
then that's
>> this is giving you a hint that it might

3048
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:39,199
>> this is giving you a hint that it might
 

3049
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:40,470
>> this is giving you a hint that it might
be possible. It says the thing that we

3050
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:40,480
be possible. It says the thing that we
 

3051
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,709
be possible. It says the thing that we
learned which we thought of as telling

3052
01:08:42,709 --> 01:08:42,719
learned which we thought of as telling
 

3053
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,309
learned which we thought of as telling
us how to get to the last step is

3054
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:44,319
us how to get to the last step is
 

3055
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,870
us how to get to the last step is
basically telling us how to get to the

3056
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:46,880
basically telling us how to get to the
 

3057
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,990
basically telling us how to get to the
actual manifold of images because it

3058
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:50,000
actual manifold of images because it
 

3059
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,110
actual manifold of images because it
can't tell the difference between the

3060
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:51,120
can't tell the difference between the
 

3061
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,590
can't tell the difference between the
last step and all the other steps. So

3062
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:53,600
last step and all the other steps. So
 

3063
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,749
last step and all the other steps. So
maybe there's a way to pull this off,

3064
01:08:55,749 --> 01:08:55,759
maybe there's a way to pull this off,
 

3065
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,070
maybe there's a way to pull this off,
but how? That's the question. Can we

3066
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,080
but how? That's the question. Can we
 

3067
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,349
but how? That's the question. Can we
actually do it? Okay, so I want to keep

3068
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:01,359
actually do it? Okay, so I want to keep
 

3069
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,269
actually do it? Okay, so I want to keep
going and so just think about this

3070
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:03,279
going and so just think about this
 

3071
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,030
going and so just think about this
picture.

3072
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:05,040
picture.
 

3073
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,590
picture.
So this I copied the picture. So we have

3074
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:07,600
So this I copied the picture. So we have
 

3075
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,510
So this I copied the picture. So we have
a stocastic process we've set up that

3076
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:09,520
a stocastic process we've set up that
 

3077
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,269
a stocastic process we've set up that
starts at X0 which we don't know the

3078
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:11,279
starts at X0 which we don't know the
 

3079
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,990
starts at X0 which we don't know the
distribution of P 0. we don't know P 0

3080
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:14,000
distribution of P 0. we don't know P 0
 

3081
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,669
distribution of P 0. we don't know P 0
and sort of walks us to P1 which we know

3082
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:19,679
and sort of walks us to P1 which we know
 

3083
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,030
and sort of walks us to P1 which we know
and then we said look I can sample from

3084
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:23,040
and then we said look I can sample from
 

3085
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:27,590
and then we said look I can sample from
P1 and then I can walk backwards

3086
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:27,600
P1 and then I can walk backwards
 

3087
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,149
P1 and then I can walk backwards
in this process stochcastically and I'll

3088
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:30,159
in this process stochcastically and I'll
 

3089
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:33,510
in this process stochcastically and I'll
end up inside P 0 as a distribution. I

3090
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:33,520
end up inside P 0 as a distribution. I
 

3091
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,910
end up inside P 0 as a distribution. I
won't end up where I started

3092
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:35,920
won't end up where I started
 

3093
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,229
won't end up where I started
necessarily. Even if I took this result

3094
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:38,239
necessarily. Even if I took this result
 

3095
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:39,749
necessarily. Even if I took this result
and fed it backward here, I'm not going

3096
01:09:39,749 --> 01:09:39,759
and fed it backward here, I'm not going
 

3097
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,669
and fed it backward here, I'm not going
to end up back where I started. but I'll

3098
01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:41,679
to end up back where I started. but I'll
 

3099
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:44,229
to end up back where I started. but I'll
end up in the same distribution.

3100
01:09:44,229 --> 01:09:44,239
end up in the same distribution.
 

3101
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:47,669
end up in the same distribution.
That's our picture.

3102
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
That's our picture.
 

3103
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,309
That's our picture.
And along the way, we had all these PTS

3104
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:50,319
And along the way, we had all these PTS
 

3105
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,030
And along the way, we had all these PTS
which are marginalss along the way. So

3106
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040
which are marginalss along the way. So
 

3107
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,709
which are marginalss along the way. So
there all these marginals is a giant

3108
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:54,719
there all these marginals is a giant
 

3109
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,189
there all these marginals is a giant
joint distribution that's constructed by

3110
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:57,199
joint distribution that's constructed by
 

3111
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,910
joint distribution that's constructed by
our stoastic process.

3112
01:09:59,910 --> 01:09:59,920
our stoastic process.
 

3113
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,910
our stoastic process.
So what's the idea? DDPM

3114
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:03,920
So what's the idea? DDPM
 

3115
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,669
So what's the idea? DDPM
says I'm going to walk backwards to the

3116
01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:05,679
says I'm going to walk backwards to the
 

3117
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,350
says I'm going to walk backwards to the
same joint distribution that I walked

3118
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:07,360
same joint distribution that I walked
 

3119
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,189
same joint distribution that I walked
forward on

3120
01:10:09,189 --> 01:10:09,199
forward on
 

3121
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,390
forward on
except I'm going to go backwards on that

3122
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:10,400
except I'm going to go backwards on that
 

3123
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,149
except I'm going to go backwards on that
joint distribution

3124
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:12,159
joint distribution
 

3125
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:13,669
joint distribution
and that'll give me the right marginal

3126
01:10:13,669 --> 01:10:13,679
and that'll give me the right marginal
 

3127
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:14,790
and that'll give me the right marginal
at the end because I'll have the same

3128
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:14,800
at the end because I'll have the same
 

3129
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,270
at the end because I'll have the same
joint distribution.

3130
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:17,280
joint distribution.
 

3131
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,669
joint distribution.
But you realize that you actually have

3132
01:10:19,669 --> 01:10:19,679
But you realize that you actually have
 

3133
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:22,950
But you realize that you actually have
some design flexibility here. The design

3134
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:22,960
some design flexibility here. The design
 

3135
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,590
some design flexibility here. The design
flexibility we have here is that all we

3136
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:25,600
flexibility we have here is that all we
 

3137
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,350
flexibility we have here is that all we
really care about is the marginal at the

3138
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:27,360
really care about is the marginal at the
 

3139
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,590
really care about is the marginal at the
end.

3140
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:29,600
end.
 

3141
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,070
end.
So, one way that we could imagine doing

3142
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:32,080
So, one way that we could imagine doing
 

3143
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,270
So, one way that we could imagine doing
this, again, it's like a leap. I don't

3144
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:33,280
this, again, it's like a leap. I don't
 

3145
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,390
this, again, it's like a leap. I don't
know how to do this yet, but it's a

3146
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:34,400
know how to do this yet, but it's a
 

3147
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,830
know how to do this yet, but it's a
leap, is maybe I can just walk through

3148
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:37,840
leap, is maybe I can just walk through
 

3149
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,830
leap, is maybe I can just walk through
these marginals

3150
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:39,840
these marginals
 

3151
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,070
these marginals
going backward

3152
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:42,080
going backward
 

3153
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,270
going backward
without walking through the joint

3154
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:43,280
without walking through the joint
 

3155
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,110
without walking through the joint
distribution. I'll pick a different

3156
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:45,120
distribution. I'll pick a different
 

3157
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,590
distribution. I'll pick a different
joint distribution that'll have the same

3158
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:47,600
joint distribution that'll have the same
 

3159
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,430
joint distribution that'll have the same
marginalss. Then I could walk through

3160
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,440
marginalss. Then I could walk through
 

3161
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,270
marginalss. Then I could walk through
those marginalss and I'll end up in this

3162
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:51,280
those marginalss and I'll end up in this
 

3163
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,830
those marginalss and I'll end up in this
marginal I want. Of course, I don't I

3164
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:53,840
marginal I want. Of course, I don't I
 

3165
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,030
marginal I want. Of course, I don't I
don't even have to do that. All I have

3166
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:55,040
don't even have to do that. All I have
 

3167
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,510
don't even have to do that. All I have
to do is end up here. But one way I

3168
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:57,520
to do is end up here. But one way I
 

3169
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,630
to do is end up here. But one way I
don't know how to think about that. So

3170
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:58,640
don't know how to think about that. So
 

3171
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,870
don't know how to think about that. So
I'm trying to find ways of thinking of

3172
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:00,880
I'm trying to find ways of thinking of
 

3173
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:07,590
I'm trying to find ways of thinking of
my freedom. Yeah.

3174
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:07,600

 

3175
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,390

>> P1. Yes. Marginal at different steps.

3176
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:12,400
>> P1. Yes. Marginal at different steps.
 

3177
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,350
>> P1. Yes. Marginal at different steps.
So this is the idea. Okay. You only need

3178
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:15,360
So this is the idea. Okay. You only need
 

3179
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,910
So this is the idea. Okay. You only need
P 0 not. So here's the question. Let's

3180
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:17,920
P 0 not. So here's the question. Let's
 

3181
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,310
P 0 not. So here's the question. Let's
try to walk backwards the same marginals

3182
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:20,320
try to walk backwards the same marginals
 

3183
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,149
try to walk backwards the same marginals
but a different joint distribution. So

3184
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:22,159
but a different joint distribution. So
 

3185
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:24,070
but a different joint distribution. So
now what I'm going to do is you might

3186
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:24,080
now what I'm going to do is you might
 

3187
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,750
now what I'm going to do is you might
think this is ridiculous. Okay, you can

3188
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:25,760
think this is ridiculous. Okay, you can
 

3189
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,669
think this is ridiculous. Okay, you can
do this, but is there any example, any

3190
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:27,679
do this, but is there any example, any
 

3191
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:29,669
do this, but is there any example, any
reason to believe this would succeed?

3192
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:29,679
reason to believe this would succeed?
 

3193
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:31,270
reason to believe this would succeed?
So, I'm going to try to show you a

3194
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:31,280
So, I'm going to try to show you a
 

3195
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,470
So, I'm going to try to show you a
simple example that will give you why

3196
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:34,480
simple example that will give you why
 

3197
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,910
simple example that will give you why
this might succeed. And then this

3198
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:35,920
this might succeed. And then this
 

3199
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,270
this might succeed. And then this
example will turn out to contain the

3200
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:37,280
example will turn out to contain the
 

3201
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,510
example will turn out to contain the
kernel of how to do all of this. So,

3202
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:39,520
kernel of how to do all of this. So,
 

3203
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,830
kernel of how to do all of this. So,
what's the example?

3204
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:41,840
what's the example?
 

3205
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,350
what's the example?
Example is okay, I have to simplify this

3206
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:45,360
Example is okay, I have to simplify this
 

3207
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,030
Example is okay, I have to simplify this
picture. So, I'm going to simplify it to

3208
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:47,040
picture. So, I'm going to simplify it to
 

3209
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,030
picture. So, I'm going to simplify it to
two Gaussians,

3210
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,040
two Gaussians,
 

3211
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,590
two Gaussians,
normal 01 and normal 02.

3212
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:53,600
normal 01 and normal 02.
 

3213
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,310
normal 01 and normal 02.
Okay, everyone good? So I'm going to

3214
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,320
Okay, everyone good? So I'm going to
 

3215
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,550
Okay, everyone good? So I'm going to
think about how are this is the marginal

3216
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:58,560
think about how are this is the marginal
 

3217
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,790
think about how are this is the marginal
for X is normal 01. The marginal for Y

3218
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:00,800
for X is normal 01. The marginal for Y
 

3219
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,950
for X is normal 01. The marginal for Y
is normal 02.

3220
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:02,960
is normal 02.
 

3221
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,790
is normal 02.
Now I will tell you a joint

3222
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:04,800
Now I will tell you a joint
 

3223
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,430
Now I will tell you a joint
distribution. The joint distribution is

3224
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:07,440
distribution. The joint distribution is
 

3225
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,550
distribution. The joint distribution is
X is drawn normal 01. Y is drawn as X

3226
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:10,560
X is drawn normal 01. Y is drawn as X
 

3227
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,709
X is drawn normal 01. Y is drawn as X
plus normal 01 independent.

3228
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:14,719
plus normal 01 independent.
 

3229
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,350
plus normal 01 independent.
That's like the forward diffusion path.

3230
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:17,360
That's like the forward diffusion path.
 

3231
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,229
That's like the forward diffusion path.
If I do this, I can do B rule to go

3232
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:20,239
If I do this, I can do B rule to go
 

3233
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:24,149
If I do this, I can do B rule to go
backwards given Y. What do I do? I take

3234
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:24,159
backwards given Y. What do I do? I take
 

3235
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:26,229
backwards given Y. What do I do? I take
I added two Gaussians and I got

3236
01:12:26,229 --> 01:12:26,239
I added two Gaussians and I got
 

3237
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,070
I added two Gaussians and I got
something. What's your best prediction

3238
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:28,080
something. What's your best prediction
 

3239
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,669
something. What's your best prediction
of the one of those Gaussians? Half,

3240
01:12:31,669 --> 01:12:31,679
of the one of those Gaussians? Half,
 

3241
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,990
of the one of those Gaussians? Half,
right? What's the standard deviation of

3242
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,000
right? What's the standard deviation of
 

3243
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,229
right? What's the standard deviation of
this? A half.

3244
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:36,239
this? A half.
 

3245
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:37,830
this? A half.
Okay.

3246
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:37,840
Okay.
 

3247
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,070
Okay.
So, this is the B rule going backwards.

3248
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:40,080
So, this is the B rule going backwards.
 

3249
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,310
So, this is the B rule going backwards.
That's what we were doing before.

3250
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:42,320
That's what we were doing before.
 

3251
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,390
That's what we were doing before.
Everyone with me?

3252
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:44,400
Everyone with me?
 

3253
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,870
Everyone with me?
This is stochastic.

3254
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:46,880
This is stochastic.
 

3255
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,149
This is stochastic.
How would I sample X given Y? I take Y

3256
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:50,159
How would I sample X given Y? I take Y
 

3257
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:53,990
How would I sample X given Y? I take Y
over two and add a Gaussian.

3258
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:54,000
over two and add a Gaussian.
 

3259
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,030
over two and add a Gaussian.
Okay, everyone's good with this. Okay,

3260
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:57,040
Okay, everyone's good with this. Okay,
 

3261
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:02,390
Okay, everyone's good with this. Okay,
now I want everyone to take one minute

3262
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:02,400
now I want everyone to take one minute
 

3263
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,189
now I want everyone to take one minute
with a piece of paper and ask yourself,

3264
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:05,199
with a piece of paper and ask yourself,
 

3265
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,070
with a piece of paper and ask yourself,
do you know any deterministic

3266
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:08,080
do you know any deterministic
 

3267
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:12,550
do you know any deterministic
way of connecting X and Y such that X

3268
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:12,560
way of connecting X and Y such that X
 

3269
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,790
way of connecting X and Y such that X
will have a distribution 01? something

3270
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:14,800
will have a distribution 01? something
 

3271
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,990
will have a distribution 01? something
has to be random. Okay. And Y will have

3272
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,000
has to be random. Okay. And Y will have
 

3273
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,790
has to be random. Okay. And Y will have
a distribution normal 02.

3274
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:20,800
a distribution normal 02.
 

3275
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,390
a distribution normal 02.
I want a deterministic connection

3276
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:22,400
I want a deterministic connection
 

3277
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,709
I want a deterministic connection
between X and Y such that the marginalss

3278
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:24,719
between X and Y such that the marginalss
 

3279
01:13:24,719 --> 01:14:03,189
between X and Y such that the marginalss
are this way. Take one minute to think.

3280
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:03,199

 

3281
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:04,709

So I hear some questions. By

3282
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:04,719
So I hear some questions. By
 

3283
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,310
So I hear some questions. By
deterministic I just mean that the

3284
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:06,320
deterministic I just mean that the
 

3285
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,510
deterministic I just mean that the
connection between X and Y is

3286
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:07,520
connection between X and Y is
 

3287
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,910
connection between X and Y is
deterministic. They something has to be

3288
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:09,920
deterministic. They something has to be
 

3289
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,110
deterministic. They something has to be
random,

3290
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,120
random,
 

3291
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:27,669
random,
>> right? So

3292
01:14:27,669 --> 01:14:27,679

 

3293
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,910

>> Okay, that's a minute.

3294
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:29,920
>> Okay, that's a minute.
 

3295
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,390
>> Okay, that's a minute.
So, anyone want to volunteer a way that

3296
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:32,400
So, anyone want to volunteer a way that
 

3297
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,149
So, anyone want to volunteer a way that
I can connect X and Y such that they

3298
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:34,159
I can connect X and Y such that they
 

3299
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:35,750
I can connect X and Y such that they
have these distributions?

3300
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:35,760
have these distributions?
 

3301
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,189
have these distributions?
>> Yeah.

3302
01:14:39,189 --> 01:14:39,199

 

3303
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,189

Y2.

3304
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:41,199
Y2.
 

3305
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,110
Y2.
>> Sure. So everyone hear that? There's

3306
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:43,120
>> Sure. So everyone hear that? There's
 

3307
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,709
>> Sure. So everyone hear that? There's
like I just connect them by square root

3308
01:14:44,709 --> 01:14:44,719
like I just connect them by square root
 

3309
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,470
like I just connect them by square root
of two. So what does that mean? So I can

3310
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:46,480
of two. So what does that mean? So I can
 

3311
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:58,709
of two. So what does that mean? So I can
think of it this way.

3312
01:14:58,709 --> 01:14:58,719

 

3313
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:04,630

Okay, this is the forward direction.

3314
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:04,640

 

3315
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,430

And then

3316
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:07,440
And then
 

3317
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:13,990
And then
reverse direction is x =

3318
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:14,000

 

3319
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,270

y /<unk> two.

3320
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:19,280

 

3321
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,430

Everyone good with this? So I go forward

3322
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:21,440
Everyone good with this? So I go forward
 

3323
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,990
Everyone good with this? So I go forward
by multiplying by two. I go backward by

3324
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:24,000
by multiplying by two. I go backward by
 

3325
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,830
by multiplying by two. I go backward by
dividing by two. If I want to sample X

3326
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840
dividing by two. If I want to sample X
 

3327
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,910
dividing by two. If I want to sample X
given Y, I can sample from Y normal 02

3328
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:31,920
given Y, I can sample from Y normal 02
 

3329
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,590
given Y, I can sample from Y normal 02
and go backward by dividing by two. So

3330
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:35,600
and go backward by dividing by two. So
 

3331
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,510
and go backward by dividing by two. So
it's clearly possible to connect two

3332
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:37,520
it's clearly possible to connect two
 

3333
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,990
it's clearly possible to connect two
Gaussians in two different ways to have

3334
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:40,000
Gaussians in two different ways to have
 

3335
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,470
Gaussians in two different ways to have
the same marginalss. But you might think

3336
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:42,480
the same marginalss. But you might think
 

3337
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,110
the same marginalss. But you might think
this example is too simple, right? And

3338
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120
this example is too simple, right? And
 

3339
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,350
this example is too simple, right? And
it kind of is, but only kind of. Okay.

3340
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:49,360
it kind of is, but only kind of. Okay.
 

3341
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,070
it kind of is, but only kind of. Okay.
So now I'll comment a little bit on the

3342
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:52,080
So now I'll comment a little bit on the
 

3343
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,390
So now I'll comment a little bit on the
history.

3344
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:54,400
history.
 

3345
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,550
history.

01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:56,560
How did people discover this idea?
 

3347
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,550
How did people discover this idea?
Obviously, they knew this forever. They

3348
01:15:58,550 --> 01:15:58,560
Obviously, they knew this forever. They
 

3349
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,910
Obviously, they knew this forever. They
didn't know this had any relevance to

3350
01:15:59,910 --> 01:15:59,920
didn't know this had any relevance to
 

3351
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,790
didn't know this had any relevance to
the problem. Okay. But then how do they

3352
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:02,800
the problem. Okay. But then how do they
 

3353
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,630
the problem. Okay. But then how do they
the complicated way? So what they did

3354
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:04,640
the complicated way? So what they did
 

3355
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,590
the complicated way? So what they did
was they said continuous time diffusion

3356
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:07,600
was they said continuous time diffusion
 

3357
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,189
was they said continuous time diffusion

because they're very important in
 

3367
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,709
because they're very important in
physics and finance. Um then they said

01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:18,719
physics and finance. Um then they said
 

3369
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:19,990

3386
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:38,000
distributions can be connected to each
 

3387
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,070

01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:42,960
maps. Transport maps are like something
 

3391
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,229

people study of how do I move

3392
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:44,239
people study of how do I move
 

3393
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:45,990

3401
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,149

3402
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:52,159

01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:53,920
for a long time.
 

3405
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,709
for a long time.
Then these maps can be move

3406
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:56,719
Then these maps can be move
 

3407
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:57,590
Then these maps can be move
probabilities to each other

3408

probabilities to each other
 

3409
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,669
probabilities to each other
deterministically. And so people said ah

3410
01:16:59,669 --> 01:16:59,679
deterministically. And so people said ah
 

3411
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,830
deterministically. And so people said ah
I can use transport mapping on these

3415
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,790

different way of doing sampling. But

3416
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:08,800
different way of doing sampling. But
 

3417
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,950
different way of doing sampling. But
this is a lot of mathematical machinery

3418
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:10,960
this is a lot of mathematical machinery
 

3419
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,709
this is a lot of mathematical machinery
that people had built up that allowed

3420
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:12,719
that people had built up that allowed
 

3421
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,229
that people had built up that allowed
them to discover this connection. But it

3422
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:14,239
them to discover this connection. But it
 

3423
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:16,950
them to discover this connection. But it
took time and they they did it. But we

3424
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:16,960
took time and they they did it. But we
 

3425
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,550
took time and they they did it. But we
can do it more simply now after we know

3426
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:20,560
can do it more simply now after we know
 

3427
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,750
can do it more simply now after we know
the connection exists. Okay. So we'll

3428
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:23,760
the connection exists. Okay. So we'll
 

3429
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,430
the connection exists. Okay. So we'll
follow a different approach which is

3430
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:27,440
follow a different approach which is
 

3431
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,830
follow a different approach which is
this is possible.

3432
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:29,840
this is possible.
 

3433
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,590
this is possible.
Maybe we can do this. How? We can guess

3434
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:33,600
Maybe we can do this. How? We can guess
 

3435
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,790
Maybe we can do this. How? We can guess
something and see if it works. Once you

3436
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:36,800
something and see if it works. Once you
 

3437
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,390
something and see if it works. Once you
know something is possible, you just

3438
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:38,400
know something is possible, you just
 

3439
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,189
know something is possible, you just
have to figure out how to guess.

3440
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:41,199
have to figure out how to guess.
 

3441
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,750
have to figure out how to guess.
So now how do you do this? What should

3442
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:43,760
So now how do you do this? What should
 

3443
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,310
So now how do you do this? What should
we guess? Okay,

3444
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:46,320
we guess? Okay,
 

3445
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,390
we guess? Okay,
so you say what do I know? Okay, I'll

3446
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:50,400
so you say what do I know? Okay, I'll
 

3447
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,149
so you say what do I know? Okay, I'll
say okay X I want to guess the

3448
01:17:52,149 --> 01:17:52,159
say okay X I want to guess the
 

3449
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:55,590
say okay X I want to guess the
deterministic connection. So I want to

3450
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:55,600
deterministic connection. So I want to
 

3451
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,750
deterministic connection. So I want to
go backwards.

3452
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:57,760
go backwards.
 

3453
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,189
go backwards.
I'm gonna think of it as I start here at

3454
01:18:01,189 --> 01:18:01,199
I'm gonna think of it as I start here at
 

3455
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,830
I'm gonna think of it as I start here at
Xhat T and then I have this estimate for

3456
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:03,840
Xhat T and then I have this estimate for
 

3457
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,229
Xhat T and then I have this estimate for
the noise this expected noise.

3458
01:18:08,229 --> 01:18:08,239
the noise this expected noise.
 

3459
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:11,110
the noise this expected noise.
Okay.

3460
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:11,120
Okay.
 

3461
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,870
Okay.
And I want to put something here in

3462
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:12,880
And I want to put something here in
 

3463
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,350
And I want to put something here in
front of this. I got to put something in

3464
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:15,360
front of this. I got to put something in
 

3465
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,149
front of this. I got to put something in
front of this and see if I can make it

3466
01:18:18,149 --> 01:18:18,159
front of this and see if I can make it
 

3467
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,790
front of this and see if I can make it
work. That would be the easiest thing if

3468
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:20,800
work. That would be the easiest thing if
 

3469
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,790
work. That would be the easiest thing if
I could do it.

3470
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:22,800
I could do it.
 

3471
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,070
I could do it.
Does everyone see why this would be a

3472
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:24,080
Does everyone see why this would be a
 

3473
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,750
Does everyone see why this would be a
guess?

3474
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:25,760
guess?
 

3475
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,110
guess?
And looking at the previous thing, you

3476
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:27,120
And looking at the previous thing, you
 

3477
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,550
And looking at the previous thing, you
might think that the answer might end up

3478
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:28,560
might think that the answer might end up
 

3479
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,270
might think that the answer might end up
having square roots in it, right? Just

3480
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:31,280
having square roots in it, right? Just
 

3481
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,310
having square roots in it, right? Just
because we got square roots up there.

3482
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:32,320
because we got square roots up there.
 

3483
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,990
because we got square roots up there.
Maybe there'll be square roots, but who

3484
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,000
Maybe there'll be square roots, but who
 

3485
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,750
Maybe there'll be square roots, but who
knows?

3486
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:35,760
knows?
 

3487
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,030
knows?
So then you have to guess what should

3488
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:37,040
So then you have to guess what should
 

3489
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,669
So then you have to guess what should
this thing be. So you try things. The

3490
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:39,679
this thing be. So you try things. The
 

3491
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:41,189
this thing be. So you try things. The
first thing you try, the first try is

3492
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:41,199
first thing you try, the first try is
 

3493
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:43,350
first thing you try, the first try is
always let's try one,

3494
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:43,360
always let's try one,
 

3495
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,189
always let's try one,
right? Let's just try to go back by the

3496
01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:45,199
right? Let's just try to go back by the
 

3497
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:47,189
right? Let's just try to go back by the
amount of the expectation. You do that,

3498
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:47,199
amount of the expectation. You do that,
 

3499
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,910
amount of the expectation. You do that,
it won't work. Okay, homework will make

3500
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:49,920
it won't work. Okay, homework will make
 

3501
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,270
it won't work. Okay, homework will make
you do it and we'll show you why it

3502
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:51,280
you do it and we'll show you why it
 

3503
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:55,270
you do it and we'll show you why it
doesn't work. So that's wrong.

3504
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:55,280
doesn't work. So that's wrong.
 

3505
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:59,750
doesn't work. So that's wrong.
So now what's your next choice? Okay,

3506
01:18:59,750 --> 01:18:59,760
So now what's your next choice? Okay,
 

3507
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,830
So now what's your next choice? Okay,
next choice is I don't know the answer.

3508
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:01,840
next choice is I don't know the answer.
 

3509
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,950
next choice is I don't know the answer.
Let me try something.

3510
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:04,960
Let me try something.
 

3511
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:09,189
Let me try something.
Okay, this is like how does this help?

3512
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:09,199
Okay, this is like how does this help?
 

3513
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:12,470
Okay, this is like how does this help?
Okay, why does this help?

3514
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,480
Okay, why does this help?
 

3515
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,189
Okay, why does this help?
This helps because if you have such a

3516
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:15,199
This helps because if you have such a
 

3517
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,669
This helps because if you have such a
str thing and you want it to work and

3518
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:17,679
str thing and you want it to work and
 

3519
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,070
str thing and you want it to work and
you don't know what to guess, you say

3520
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:20,080
you don't know what to guess, you say
 

3521
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,390
you don't know what to guess, you say
let me pick an example

3522
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:22,400
let me pick an example
 

3523
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,110
let me pick an example
for which I know the answer

3524
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:25,120
for which I know the answer
 

3525
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,870
for which I know the answer
and let me figure out how to make the

3526
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:26,880
and let me figure out how to make the
 

3527
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,510
and let me figure out how to make the
example what the lambda should be for

3528
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:29,520
example what the lambda should be for
 

3529
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,550
example what the lambda should be for
the example I chose

3530
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:32,560
the example I chose
 

3531
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,189
the example I chose
and then I'll get a guess.

3532
01:19:35,189 --> 01:19:35,199
and then I'll get a guess.
 

3533
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,669
and then I'll get a guess.
You see this? It's like a way of moving.

3534
01:19:37,669 --> 01:19:37,679
You see this? It's like a way of moving.
 

3535
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,430
You see this? It's like a way of moving.
If you you want to guess something and

3536
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:39,440
If you you want to guess something and
 

3537
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,189
If you you want to guess something and
you don't know what it is, pick

3538
01:19:41,189 --> 01:19:41,199
you don't know what it is, pick
 

3539
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:42,550
you don't know what it is, pick
something which you know you can analyze

3540
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:42,560
something which you know you can analyze
 

3541
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,070
something which you know you can analyze
everything and try to fill in the what

3542
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:44,080
everything and try to fill in the what
 

3543
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,390
everything and try to fill in the what
the thing should be.

3544
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:46,400
the thing should be.
 

3545
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,669
the thing should be.
So you want to pick the easiest example.

3546
01:19:49,669 --> 01:19:49,679
So you want to pick the easiest example.
 

3547
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,870
So you want to pick the easiest example.
Okay, the easiest example of a

3548
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:52,880
Okay, the easiest example of a
 

3549
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,189
Okay, the easiest example of a
distribution for P

3550
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:55,199
distribution for P
 

3551
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:58,229
distribution for P
for which you can do forward diffusion

3552
01:19:58,229 --> 01:19:58,239
for which you can do forward diffusion
 

3553
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:02,310
for which you can do forward diffusion
and understand backwards process.

3554
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:02,320
and understand backwards process.
 

3555
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,709
and understand backwards process.
So what is the absolutely easiest

3556
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:04,719
So what is the absolutely easiest
 

3557
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,990
So what is the absolutely easiest
probability distribution?

3558
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:08,000
probability distribution?
 

3559
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,110
probability distribution?
Uniform.

3560
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:09,120
Uniform.
 

3561
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,630
Uniform.
>> Uniform. Tell me something easier than

3562
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:10,640
>> Uniform. Tell me something easier than
 

3563
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,830
>> Uniform. Tell me something easier than
uniform.

3564
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:13,840

 

3565
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,070

>> Yeah.

3566
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,080
>> Yeah.
 

3567
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,750
>> Yeah.
>> Concentrate all mass on one point. A

3568
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:17,760
>> Concentrate all mass on one point. A
 

3569
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:21,189
>> Concentrate all mass on one point. A
constant. So just pick zero.

3570
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:21,199
constant. So just pick zero.
 

3571
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:22,950
constant. So just pick zero.
Okay.

3572
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:22,960
Okay.
 

3573
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,830
Okay.
Try zero. I mean like you're trying you

3574
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:25,840
Try zero. I mean like you're trying you
 

3575
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,430
Try zero. I mean like you're trying you
you you think something might work. Try

3576
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:27,440
you you think something might work. Try
 

3577
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,870
you you think something might work. Try
the simplest thing. Worst case it

3578
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:28,880
the simplest thing. Worst case it
 

3579
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,990
the simplest thing. Worst case it
doesn't work but you didn't spend too

3580
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,000
doesn't work but you didn't spend too
 

3581
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,070
doesn't work but you didn't spend too
much work. So go for it, right? So try

3582
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:34,080
much work. So go for it, right? So try
 

3583
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,149
much work. So go for it, right? So try
zero.

3584
01:20:36,149 --> 01:20:36,159
zero.
 

3585
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:38,709
zero.
always zero. Why is this nice? Because

3586
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:38,719
always zero. Why is this nice? Because
 

3587
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,470
always zero. Why is this nice? Because
now I know all the marginalss. They're

3588
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:40,480
now I know all the marginalss. They're
 

3589
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,350
now I know all the marginalss. They're
all Gaussian.

3590
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:43,360
all Gaussian.
 

3591
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,229
all Gaussian.
And hey, I know how to connect two

3592
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:46,239
And hey, I know how to connect two
 

3593
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:49,510
And hey, I know how to connect two
Gaussians. I know that works. So maybe

3594
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:49,520
Gaussians. I know that works. So maybe
 

3595
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,669
Gaussians. I know that works. So maybe
this will work.

3596
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:51,679
this will work.
 

3597
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,950
this will work.
So you try it. So you go, okay, here we

3598
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:54,960
So you try it. So you go, okay, here we
 

3599
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,310
So you try it. So you go, okay, here we
go.

3600
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:58,320

 

3601
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,310

I know XT

3602
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:00,320
I know XT
 

3603
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,990
I know XT
XT is going to be a Gaussian with

3604
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,000
XT is going to be a Gaussian with
 

3605
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,709
XT is going to be a Gaussian with
variance T sigma squ.

3606
01:21:04,709 --> 01:21:04,719
variance T sigma squ.
 

3607
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,310
variance T sigma squ.
I start at zero. I keep moving.

3608
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:08,320
I start at zero. I keep moving.
 

3609
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,950
I start at zero. I keep moving.
So I know mut is this conditional

3610
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:10,960
So I know mut is this conditional
 

3611
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,790
So I know mut is this conditional
expectation

3612
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:12,800
expectation
 

3613
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,990
expectation
in this case. But this is a Gaussian.

3614
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:16,000
in this case. But this is a Gaussian.
 

3615
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,910
in this case. But this is a Gaussian.
This is a Gaussian. This is connected to

3616
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:17,920
This is a Gaussian. This is connected to
 

3617
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,270
This is a Gaussian. This is connected to
this independently. This is jointly

3618
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280
this independently. This is jointly
 

3619
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,870
this independently. This is jointly
Gaussian. I know exactly what the answer

3620
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:20,880
Gaussian. I know exactly what the answer
 

3621
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,830
Gaussian. I know exactly what the answer
is here.

3622
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:23,840
is here.
 

3623
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,790
is here.
So

3624
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:26,800
So
 

3625
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,350
So
I know that what is my prediction to go

3626
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:29,360
I know that what is my prediction to go
 

3627
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:33,350
I know that what is my prediction to go
back one step? Where am I?

3628
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:33,360
back one step? Where am I?
 

3629
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:39,270
back one step? Where am I?
like just go t minus delta t over t.

3630
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:39,280

 

3631
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:43,590

Okay, good. So now I plug it in. I'm

3632
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:43,600
Okay, good. So now I plug it in. I'm
 

3633
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,550
Okay, good. So now I plug it in. I'm
guessing, right? So

3634
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:46,560
guessing, right? So
 

3635
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,149
guessing, right? So
xt minus delta t equals xt plus this

3636
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:50,159
xt minus delta t equals xt plus this
 

3637
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,750
xt minus delta t equals xt plus this
guy.

3638
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:51,760
guy.
 

3639
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,709
guy.
Plug in my prediction minus xt.

3640
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:56,719

 

3641
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:01,189

Simplify math a little bit. This is just

3642
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:01,199
Simplify math a little bit. This is just
 

3643
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:07,110
Simplify math a little bit. This is just
xt * 1 minus lambda delta t / t.

3644
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:07,120
xt * 1 minus lambda delta t / t.
 

3645
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,149
xt * 1 minus lambda delta t / t.
Now I want to make it work. What does it

3646
01:22:10,149 --> 01:22:10,159
Now I want to make it work. What does it
 

3647
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,950
Now I want to make it work. What does it
mean to make it work?

3648
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:12,960
mean to make it work?
 

3649
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,350
mean to make it work?
I would like to get the distribution of

3650
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:15,360
I would like to get the distribution of
 

3651
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,910
I would like to get the distribution of
this correct.

3652
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:17,920
this correct.
 

3653
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,430
this correct.
Right? I know what distribution I want

3654
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:19,440
Right? I know what distribution I want
 

3655
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,070
Right? I know what distribution I want
for this. I want it to be normal with a

3656
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:22,080
for this. I want it to be normal with a
 

3657
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,950
for this. I want it to be normal with a
given variance. I know the distribution

3658
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:24,960
given variance. I know the distribution
 

3659
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,870
given variance. I know the distribution
of this

3660
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:26,880
of this
 

3661
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,110
of this
normal with a known variance. I know

3662
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:29,120
normal with a known variance. I know
 

3663
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,310
normal with a known variance. I know
this is a constant. I can do this. This

3664
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:32,320
this is a constant. I can do this. This
 

3665
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,149
this is a constant. I can do this. This
is algebra now. So you solve for lambda.

3666
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:36,159
is algebra now. So you solve for lambda.
 

3667
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,950
is algebra now. So you solve for lambda.
Okay. Mash the distribution variances.

3668
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:38,960
Okay. Mash the distribution variances.
 

3669
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,189
Okay. Mash the distribution variances.
So I know the the variance I want here.

3670
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:41,199
So I know the the variance I want here.
 

3671
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:42,870
So I know the the variance I want here.
The variance I want here is sigma square

3672
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:42,880
The variance I want here is sigma square
 

3673
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,590
The variance I want here is sigma square
t minus delta t.

3674
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:45,600
t minus delta t.
 

3675
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,590
t minus delta t.
This has to be I know the variance of

3676
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:47,600
This has to be I know the variance of
 

3677
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,550
This has to be I know the variance of
this sigma square t. I know I have to

3678
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:50,560
this sigma square t. I know I have to
 

3679
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,270
this sigma square t. I know I have to
square this guy.

3680
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:53,280
square this guy.
 

3681
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,270
square this guy.
So now I look at this and I go okay

3682
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:55,280
So now I look at this and I go okay
 

3683
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,709
So now I look at this and I go okay
sigma squares cancel. That's good.

3684
01:22:58,709 --> 01:22:58,719
sigma squares cancel. That's good.
 

3685
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,270
sigma squares cancel. That's good.
But I have

3686
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:01,280
But I have
 

3687
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,629
But I have
algebra. I can solve this algebra. Does

3688
01:23:04,629 --> 01:23:04,639
algebra. I can solve this algebra. Does
 

3689
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:07,350
algebra. I can solve this algebra. Does
everyone see? This is now just algebra.

3690
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:07,360
everyone see? This is now just algebra.
 

3691
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,270
everyone see? This is now just algebra.
So you can just grind through the

3692
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:09,280
So you can just grind through the
 

3693
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:14,149
So you can just grind through the
algebra which I will not bore you with.

3694
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:14,159
algebra which I will not bore you with.
 

3695
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,310
algebra which I will not bore you with.
It's like literally three calculations

3696
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
It's like literally three calculations
 

3697
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,790
It's like literally three calculations
of algebra. I'll post the notes so you

3698
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:18,800
of algebra. I'll post the notes so you
 

3699
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,390
of algebra. I'll post the notes so you
can look at it there. I want to keep get

3700
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:20,400
can look at it there. I want to keep get
 

3701
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,110
can look at it there. I want to keep get
to the point. You can also write this in

3702
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:23,120
to the point. You can also write this in
 

3703
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:28,390
to the point. You can also write this in
a different form.

3704
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:28,400

 

3705
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,070

Okay, using other algebra tricks it

3706
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:30,080
Okay, using other algebra tricks it
 

3707
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,750
Okay, using other algebra tricks it
doesn't matter. Important thing is I

3708
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:31,760
doesn't matter. Important thing is I
 

3709
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,990
doesn't matter. Important thing is I
have a actual prediction for lambda

3710
01:23:35,990 --> 01:23:36,000
have a actual prediction for lambda
 

3711
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,470
have a actual prediction for lambda
from this simple example.

3712
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:38,480
from this simple example.
 

3713
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,270
from this simple example.
And then I can say okay let's think of

3714
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:41,280
And then I can say okay let's think of
 

3715
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,669
And then I can say okay let's think of
how this behaves

3716
01:23:43,669 --> 01:23:43,679
how this behaves
 

3717
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,870
how this behaves
when when t is large this thing is

3718
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:46,880
when when t is large this thing is
 

3719
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,189
when when t is large this thing is
basically a half because t minus delta t

3720
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:49,199
basically a half because t minus delta t
 

3721
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:53,990
basically a half because t minus delta t
is basically t and this is just a half.

3722
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,000
is basically t and this is just a half.
 

3723
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,229
is basically t and this is just a half.
when

3724
01:23:56,229 --> 01:23:56,239
when
 

3725
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,350
when
t is something else like delta t this is

3726
01:23:59,350 --> 01:23:59,360
t is something else like delta t this is
 

3727
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,350
t is something else like delta t this is
one

3728
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:01,360
one
 

3729
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,510
one
and then it quickly cuts to half.

3730
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:05,520
and then it quickly cuts to half.
 

3731
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,590
and then it quickly cuts to half.
Everyone see this?

3732
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:07,600
Everyone see this?
 

3733
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,270
Everyone see this?
So

3734
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:09,280
So
 

3735
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,550
So
it just says that basically

3736
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:12,560
it just says that basically
 

3737
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,390
it just says that basically
run backwards

3738
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:14,400
run backwards
 

3739
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,669
run backwards
except instead of going the full

3740
01:24:15,669 --> 01:24:15,679
except instead of going the full
 

3741
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:19,270
except instead of going the full
direction full amount go half.

3742
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:19,280
direction full amount go half.
 

3743
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,510
direction full amount go half.
Okay. and go half half half and at the

3744
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:21,520
Okay. and go half half half and at the
 

3745
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,270
Okay. and go half half half and at the
very end, you know, kind of glide in

3746
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:23,280
very end, you know, kind of glide in
 

3747
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,910
very end, you know, kind of glide in
slightly differently.

3748
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:25,920
slightly differently.
 

3749
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,550
slightly differently.
It says do this.

3750
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:28,560
It says do this.
 

3751
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,390
It says do this.
Okay. Does it work? It does. So, you

3752
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:32,400
Okay. Does it work? It does. So, you
 

3753
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,189
Okay. Does it work? It does. So, you
just like write code and it works. It's

3754
01:24:35,189 --> 01:24:35,199
just like write code and it works. It's
 

3755
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,550
just like write code and it works. It's
like great. Now, of course, you can go

3756
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:36,560
like great. Now, of course, you can go
 

3757
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,390
like great. Now, of course, you can go
and do and actually there's like a just

3758
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:38,400
and do and actually there's like a just
 

3759
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,590
and do and actually there's like a just
description of how you can prove it

3760
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:39,600
description of how you can prove it
 

3761
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,229
description of how you can prove it
prove it more generally. Um, but in

3762
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:42,239
prove it more generally. Um, but in
 

3763
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:45,270
prove it more generally. Um, but in
terms of code, you already have code,

3764
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:45,280
terms of code, you already have code,
 

3765
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,270
terms of code, you already have code,
right? Because it says what do you do?

3766
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:47,280
right? Because it says what do you do?
 

3767
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,870
right? Because it says what do you do?
sample from the outer distribution.

3768
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:50,880
sample from the outer distribution.
 

3769
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:56,390
sample from the outer distribution.
Take a step by this much

3770
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:56,400

 

3771
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,470

and repeat.

3772
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:58,480
and repeat.
 

3773
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,669
and repeat.
This is DDIM sampling and it works. So I

3774
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:01,679
This is DDIM sampling and it works. So I
 

3775
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,830
This is DDIM sampling and it works. So I
want to show you a cool picture. It's

3776
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:03,840
want to show you a cool picture. It's
 

3777
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,110
want to show you a cool picture. It's
like an OD perspective on this. Um it

3778
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:07,120
like an OD perspective on this. Um it
 

3779
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,790
like an OD perspective on this. Um it
just tells you like what direction am I

3780
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:08,800
just tells you like what direction am I
 

3781
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,310
just tells you like what direction am I
moving? That's all that matters. Okay.

3782
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:10,320
moving? That's all that matters. Okay.
 

3783
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,070
moving? That's all that matters. Okay.
So here here's a cool picture from the

3784
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:12,080
So here here's a cool picture from the
 

3785
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,070
So here here's a cool picture from the
paper.

3786
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:14,080
paper.
 

3787
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,870
paper.
So the cool picture here is you want to

3788
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:16,880
So the cool picture here is you want to
 

3789
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,870
So the cool picture here is you want to
learn this spiral,

3790
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:18,880
learn this spiral,
 

3791
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,110
learn this spiral,
okay? And you have samples. So what

3792
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:21,120
okay? And you have samples. So what
 

3793
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,550
okay? And you have samples. So what
happens? You have too few samples like

3794
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:22,560
happens? You have too few samples like
 

3795
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,229
happens? You have too few samples like
this. You can't even see the spiral

3796
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:24,239
this. You can't even see the spiral
 

3797
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:27,990
this. You can't even see the spiral
here, right? What does it learn? It

3798
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:28,000
here, right? What does it learn? It
 

3799
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,149
here, right? What does it learn? It
learns these like collection of spiders.

3800
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,159
learns these like collection of spiders.
 

3801
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:33,430
learns these like collection of spiders.
Okay? So in that the flows are all

3802
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:33,440
Okay? So in that the flows are all
 

3803
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,270
Okay? So in that the flows are all
moving in to those data points, those

3804
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:35,280
moving in to those data points, those
 

3805
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,590
moving in to those data points, those
training points.

3806
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:37,600
training points.
 

3807
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,229
training points.
And this is like a um an MLP. They train

3808
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:40,239
And this is like a um an MLP. They train
 

3809
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:43,030
And this is like a um an MLP. They train
an MLP for this.

3810
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,040
an MLP for this.
 

3811
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,590
an MLP for this.
If you add more points, the flows are

3812
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:45,600
If you add more points, the flows are
 

3813
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,390
If you add more points, the flows are
moving like this. And with enough

3814
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:48,400
moving like this. And with enough
 

3815
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,750
moving like this. And with enough
points, you can kind of see how they're

3816
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:49,760
points, you can kind of see how they're
 

3817
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,030
points, you can kind of see how they're
all coming in kind of to this spiral

3818
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:53,040
all coming in kind of to this spiral
 

3819
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,750
all coming in kind of to this spiral
shape. It's kind of has learned to flow

3820
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:55,760
shape. It's kind of has learned to flow
 

3821
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,270
shape. It's kind of has learned to flow
in this way. And you can see how it's

3822
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:57,280
in this way. And you can see how it's
 

3823
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,790
in this way. And you can see how it's
kind of basically just flowing you in

3824
01:25:58,790 --> 01:25:58,800
kind of basically just flowing you in
 

3825
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,270
kind of basically just flowing you in
this direction into into where you want

3826
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:01,280
this direction into into where you want
 

3827
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,750
this direction into into where you want
to go.

3828
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:03,760
to go.
 

3829
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,870
to go.
So this is how there's a lot more that

3830
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:06,880
So this is how there's a lot more that
 

3831
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,350
So this is how there's a lot more that
can be said about diffusion. Um, but now

3832
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,360
can be said about diffusion. Um, but now
 

3833
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,709
can be said about diffusion. Um, but now
you have equipped to fully read this

3834
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:12,719
you have equipped to fully read this
 

3835
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,110
you have equipped to fully read this
paper and then to full after you fully

3836
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,120
paper and then to full after you fully
 

3837
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,870
paper and then to full after you fully
read this paper to go off and read a

3838
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:16,880
read this paper to go off and read a
 

3839
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,709
read this paper to go off and read a
bunch more if you wanted to and be able

3840
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:18,719
bunch more if you wanted to and be able
 

3841
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:20,709
bunch more if you wanted to and be able
to understand what's going on and have

3842
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:20,719
to understand what's going on and have
 

3843
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,430
to understand what's going on and have
it demystified a bit. Okay, I'm

3844
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:23,440
it demystified a bit. Okay, I'm
 

3845
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,430
it demystified a bit. Okay, I'm
basically out of time. So I'll take a

3846
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:25,440
basically out of time. So I'll take a
 

3847
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,110
basically out of time. So I'll take a
question because I don't see anyone here

3848
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:27,120
question because I don't see anyone here
 

3849
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,950
question because I don't see anyone here
yet for the next thing.

3850
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:28,960
yet for the next thing.
 

3851
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:29,350
yet for the next thing.
>> Yeah.

3852
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:29,360
>> Yeah.
 

3853
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,350
>> Yeah.
>> So does this figure kind of implies that

3854
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:31,360
>> So does this figure kind of implies that
 

3855
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,750
>> So does this figure kind of implies that
your training data has to densely cover,

3856
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:33,760
your training data has to densely cover,
 

3857
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,629
your training data has to densely cover,
right?

3858
01:26:34,629 --> 01:26:34,639
right?
 

3859
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,310
right?
>> Yes. This figure is actually very

3860
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:36,320
>> Yes. This figure is actually very
 

3861
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,830
>> Yes. This figure is actually very
thoughtprovoking and provocative because

3862
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:37,840
thoughtprovoking and provocative because
 

3863
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,669
thoughtprovoking and provocative because
it tells you that the training data has

3864
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:39,679
it tells you that the training data has
 

3865
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,510
it tells you that the training data has
to cover the manifold enough which is

3866
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:41,520
to cover the manifold enough which is
 

3867
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,709
to cover the manifold enough which is
you already know that you need to have

3868
01:26:42,709 --> 01:26:42,719
you already know that you need to have
 

3869
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,629
you already know that you need to have
enough samples and you see here maybe

3870
01:26:44,629 --> 01:26:44,639
enough samples and you see here maybe
 

3871
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:45,590
enough samples and you see here maybe
you would have hoped that it would

3872
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:45,600
you would have hoped that it would
 

3873
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,070
you would have hoped that it would
extrapolated the spiral in and it

3874
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:48,080
extrapolated the spiral in and it
 

3875
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,950
extrapolated the spiral in and it
definitely did not without with the only

3876
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:50,960
definitely did not without with the only
 

3877
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,229
definitely did not without with the only
the inductive bias of an MLP

3878
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:54,239
the inductive bias of an MLP
 

3879
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:56,629
the inductive bias of an MLP
right so it does it just yeah that's

3880
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:56,639
right so it does it just yeah that's
 

3881
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:00,149
right so it does it just yeah that's
true

3882
01:27:00,149 --> 01:27:00,159

 

3883
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:03,590

okay so with that um see everyone at the

3884
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:03,600
okay so with that um see everyone at the
 

3885
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,149
okay so with that um see everyone at the
poster session have office hours now and

3886
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:06,159
poster session have office hours now and
 

3887
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:11,800
poster session have office hours now and
then at the exam. Okay. end.
