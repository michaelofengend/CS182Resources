1
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,670

come to lecture in your study groups and

2
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680
come to lecture in your study groups and
 

3
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,389
come to lecture in your study groups and
sit with your study group together. Um

4
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
sit with your study group together. Um
 

5
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,990
sit with your study group together. Um
that way when something's confusing you

6
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
that way when something's confusing you
 

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,110
that way when something's confusing you
have someone next to you that you can

8
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
have someone next to you that you can
 

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,430
have someone next to you that you can
actually ask a question and I find that

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
actually ask a question and I find that
 

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,670
actually ask a question and I find that
this really makes a difference to the

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
this really makes a difference to the
 

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,869
this really makes a difference to the
students uh as you go forward. So

14
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
students uh as you go forward. So
 

15
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,950
students uh as you go forward. So
strongly strongly recommend that whoever

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
strongly strongly recommend that whoever
 

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,389
strongly strongly recommend that whoever
you're working with on homeworks get

18
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
you're working with on homeworks get
 

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,990
you're working with on homeworks get
them to come to lecture and sit next to

20
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
them to come to lecture and sit next to
 

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:24,630
them to come to lecture and sit next to
you in the lecture room.

22
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,640

 

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,950

Okay. So, I'm going to try a couple of

24
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
Okay. So, I'm going to try a couple of
 

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,310
Okay. So, I'm going to try a couple of
different ways of presenting the

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320
different ways of presenting the
 

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,789
different ways of presenting the
material today in terms of how I use the

28
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
material today in terms of how I use the
 

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,590
material today in terms of how I use the
technology. If you have any feedback on

30
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
technology. If you have any feedback on
 

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,990
technology. If you have any feedback on
this, please let me know. Um, and I will

32
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
this, please let me know. Um, and I will
 

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,550
this, please let me know. Um, and I will
try to adapt to whatever is working with

34
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
try to adapt to whatever is working with
 

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,030
try to adapt to whatever is working with
the best for the most number of people.

36
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
the best for the most number of people.
 

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,270
the best for the most number of people.
So, what we're going to do today uh is

38
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
So, what we're going to do today uh is
 

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,630
So, what we're going to do today uh is
we're going to pick up where we left off

40
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
we're going to pick up where we left off
 

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,910
we're going to pick up where we left off
last. Before I start officially,

42
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
last. Before I start officially,
 

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,069
last. Before I start officially,
um let me just remind you all that

44
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
um let me just remind you all that
 

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,030
um let me just remind you all that
homework zero is due. When is homework

46
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
homework zero is due. When is homework
 

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,789
homework zero is due. When is homework
zero due?

48
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
zero due?
 

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,670
zero due?
>> Tomorrow at 10:59 p.m. Friday. And what

50
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
>> Tomorrow at 10:59 p.m. Friday. And what
 

51
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,350
>> Tomorrow at 10:59 p.m. Friday. And what
happens if you don't submit homework

52
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
happens if you don't submit homework
 

53
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,190
happens if you don't submit homework
zero?

54
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
zero?
 

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,869
zero?
>> You're dropped from the class, right?

56
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
>> You're dropped from the class, right?
 

57
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,309
>> You're dropped from the class, right?
So, please submit homework zero. Don't

58
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
So, please submit homework zero. Don't
 

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,790
So, please submit homework zero. Don't
accidentally get dropped from the class.

60
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
accidentally get dropped from the class.
 

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,430
accidentally get dropped from the class.
Don't wait till 10:58 to submit it and

62
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
Don't wait till 10:58 to submit it and
 

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,350
Don't wait till 10:58 to submit it and
then have grades grow crash on you and

64
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
then have grades grow crash on you and
 

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,990
then have grades grow crash on you and
then send us an email because the wait

66
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
then send us an email because the wait
 

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,229
then send us an email because the wait
list is so huge. And as you've probably

68
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
list is so huge. And as you've probably
 

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,229
list is so huge. And as you've probably
seen, we are not able to respond to all

70
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
seen, we are not able to respond to all
 

71
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,750
seen, we are not able to respond to all
of your emails. So, just, you know,

72
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
of your emails. So, just, you know,
 

73
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,550
of your emails. So, just, you know,
submit it at 10 p.m. instead of 10:59

74
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
submit it at 10 p.m. instead of 10:59
 

75
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,070
submit it at 10 p.m. instead of 10:59
p.m. That way, you have all this time to

76
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
p.m. That way, you have all this time to
 

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,750
p.m. That way, you have all this time to
deal with any kind of buffer, whatever,

78
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
deal with any kind of buffer, whatever,
 

79
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,509
deal with any kind of buffer, whatever,
late submission, this that. Um, make

80
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
late submission, this that. Um, make
 

81
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,030
late submission, this that. Um, make
sure it goes in. You've had more than a

82
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
sure it goes in. You've had more than a
 

83
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,309
sure it goes in. You've had more than a
week to complete it, and it should be

84
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
week to complete it, and it should be
 

85
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,229
week to complete it, and it should be
all material that's based on

86
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
all material that's based on
 

87
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,910
all material that's based on
prerequisites.

88
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
prerequisites.
 

89
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,910
prerequisites.
Okay. Any administrative questions

90
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
Okay. Any administrative questions
 

91
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,270
Okay. Any administrative questions
before we start?

92
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
before we start?
 

93
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,270
before we start?
Okay. So, the expansion is definitely

94
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
Okay. So, the expansion is definitely
 

95
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,390
Okay. So, the expansion is definitely
happening. You should all be getting

96
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
happening. You should all be getting
 

97
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,309
happening. You should all be getting
emails and like be officially being led

98
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
emails and like be officially being led
 

99
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,630
emails and like be officially being led
into the class. We are hoping to clear

100
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:00,640
into the class. We are hoping to clear
 

101
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,710
into the class. We are hoping to clear
the wait list. Okay, so all of you on

102
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720
the wait list. Okay, so all of you on
 

103
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,430
the wait list. Okay, so all of you on
the wait list, fingers crossed. I cannot

104
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
the wait list, fingers crossed. I cannot
 

105
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,589
the wait list, fingers crossed. I cannot
promise anything, but we are absolutely

106
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
promise anything, but we are absolutely
 

107
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,350
promise anything, but we are absolutely
hoping to clear the weight list. Okay,

108
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
hoping to clear the weight list. Okay,
 

109
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,470
hoping to clear the weight list. Okay,
so uh

110
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
so uh
 

111
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,550
so uh
uh that's the good news. Okay, so today

112
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
uh that's the good news. Okay, so today
 

113
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,229
uh that's the good news. Okay, so today
is all about optimization. We started

114
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
is all about optimization. We started
 

115
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,430
is all about optimization. We started
talking about it last time and we're

116
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
talking about it last time and we're
 

117
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,830
talking about it last time and we're
going to continue talking about it. The

118
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:21,840
going to continue talking about it. The
 

119
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,070
going to continue talking about it. The
first thing that I want to talk about is

120
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
first thing that I want to talk about is
 

121
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,750
first thing that I want to talk about is
building on what we started off last

122
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
building on what we started off last
 

123
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,350
building on what we started off last
time and talking about the implicit

124
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
time and talking about the implicit
 

125
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,710
time and talking about the implicit
regularization of gradient descent. So

126
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
regularization of gradient descent. So
 

127
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,190
regularization of gradient descent. So
last time we talked about how gradient

128
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
last time we talked about how gradient
 

129
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,070
last time we talked about how gradient
descent converges for linear regression

130
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,080
descent converges for linear regression
 

131
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,470
descent converges for linear regression
and we notice that what matters the most

132
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
and we notice that what matters the most
 

133
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,430
and we notice that what matters the most
is really this largest value of xrpose x

134
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
is really this largest value of xrpose x
 

135
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,670
is really this largest value of xrpose x
or the largest singular value of the

136
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
or the largest singular value of the
 

137
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,470
or the largest singular value of the
matrix x itself. Right? Remember we saw

138
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
matrix x itself. Right? Remember we saw
 

139
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,149
matrix x itself. Right? Remember we saw
this that you know we you you have to

140
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
this that you know we you you have to
 

141
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,589
this that you know we you you have to
have the learning rate smaller than

142
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
have the learning rate smaller than
 

143
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,550
have the learning rate smaller than
this. If this is if you need to remember

144
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
this. If this is if you need to remember
 

145
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,630
this. If this is if you need to remember
this go and look at the 127 notes so you

146
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
this go and look at the 127 notes so you
 

147
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,830
this go and look at the 127 notes so you
can recall this. And the key takeaway

148
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
can recall this. And the key takeaway
 

149
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,550
can recall this. And the key takeaway
that I want you to remember from that is

150
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
that I want you to remember from that is
 

151
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,990
that I want you to remember from that is
that the geometric properties of your

152
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
that the geometric properties of your
 

153
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,509
that the geometric properties of your
loss function matter in terms of the

154
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
loss function matter in terms of the
 

155
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,750
loss function matter in terms of the
practical parameters and hyperparameters

156
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
practical parameters and hyperparameters
 

157
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,270
practical parameters and hyperparameters
that you will be using in tuning your

158
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
that you will be using in tuning your

we did this for le squares or so it's a
 

169
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,469
we did this for le squares or so it's a

a question right after lecture it's like
 

175
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,469
a question right after lecture it's like
I heard this thing about smoothness and

176
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
I heard this thing about smoothness and
 

177
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,430
I heard this thing about smoothness and
like strong convexity and isn't

178
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
like strong convexity and isn't
 

179
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,189
like strong convexity and isn't
convergence supposed to depend on that

convergence supposed to depend on that
 

181
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,110
convergence supposed to depend on that
so what smoothness and strong convexity

182
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
so what smoothness and strong convexity
 

183
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,030
so what smoothness and strong convexity
are is they're essentially

184
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040

And now we wanted to try and say well

268
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:35,759
And now we wanted to try and say well
 

269
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,309
And now we wanted to try and say well
can we look at ridge in the SVD

00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
can we look at ridge in the SVD
 

271
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,950
can we look at ridge in the SVD

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
just from the straight convergence proof
 

275
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,710
just from the straight convergence proof

how gradient descent is going to behave.
 

283
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,830
how gradient descent is going to behave.
So let's look at ridge in those d in

284
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
So let's look at ridge in those d in
 

285
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,150
So let's look at ridge in those d in
those coordinates as well. So here let's

286
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
those coordinates as well. So here let's
 

287
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,550
those coordinates as well. So here let's
say this SVD of X is U sigma VRpose

288
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
say this SVD of X is U sigma VRpose
 

289
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,870
say this SVD of X is U sigma VRpose
then I can write my W star

then I can write my W star
 

291
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,710
then I can write my W star
as just filling this out. So coming from

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
as just filling this out. So coming from
 

293
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,150
as just filling this out. So coming from
here

294
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160

 

295
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,430

if I just write this. So vranspose

296
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
if I just write this. So vranspose
 

297
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,990
if I just write this. So vranspose

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,629
of this and in particular what I will
see here is that this u transpose is

322
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
see here is that this u transpose is
 

323
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,749
see here is that this u transpose is
just going to cancel right

324
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
just going to cancel right
 

325
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,990
just going to cancel right
and then I have this identity here I can

326
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
and then I have this identity here I can
 

327
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,390
and then I have this identity here I can
write this identity as VVRpose because

328
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
write this identity as VVRpose because
 

329
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,710
write this identity as VVRpose because
these are orthonormal matrices. Everyone

330
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
these are orthonormal matrices. Everyone
 

331
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,270
these are orthonormal matrices. Everyone
remember that? And so I can just pull

332
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
remember that? And so I can just pull
 

333
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,670
remember that? And so I can just pull
these out and so I can rewrite this

334
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
these out and so I can rewrite this
 

335
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,430
these out and so I can rewrite this
effectively

336
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
effectively
 

337
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,510
effectively
equal to

338
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
equal to
 

339
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,110
equal to
V sigma transpose sigma

340
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
V sigma transpose sigma
 

341
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,190
V sigma transpose sigma
plus lambda I whole inverse vranspose V

342
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
plus lambda I whole inverse vranspose V
 

343
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,709
plus lambda I whole inverse vranspose V
sigma transpose uranspose Y

344
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
sigma transpose uranspose Y
 

345
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,190
sigma transpose uranspose Y
again. And now these vranspose

346
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
again. And now these vranspose
 

347
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,750
again. And now these vranspose
again because V is an orthonormal matrix

348
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
again because V is an orthonormal matrix
 

349
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,550
again because V is an orthonormal matrix
VRpose is just its inverse. So that also

350
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
VRpose is just its inverse. So that also
 

351
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,670
VRpose is just its inverse. So that also
cancels. And so I'm left with

352
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680

 

353
00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:05,670

V V.

354
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680

 

355
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,310

Okay.

356
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
Okay.
 

357
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,230
Okay.
So, what does this look like when I try

358
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
So, what does this look like when I try
 

359
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,829
So, what does this look like when I try
to write out this matrix? What is this

360
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
to write out this matrix? What is this
 

361
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,190
to write out this matrix? What is this
matrix in the middle?

362
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
matrix in the middle?
 

363
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,670
matrix in the middle?
Well, this is an almost diagonal thing.

364
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
Well, this is an almost diagonal thing.
 

365
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,509
Well, this is an almost diagonal thing.
This is an almost diagonal thing. So,

366
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
This is an almost diagonal thing. So,
 

367
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,670
This is an almost diagonal thing. So,
when I multiply them together, what am I

368
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
when I multiply them together, what am I
 

369
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,430
when I multiply them together, what am I
going to have? I'm going to have

370
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
going to have? I'm going to have
 

371
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,350
going to have? I'm going to have
something with the squares of the

372
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
something with the squares of the
 

373
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,990
something with the squares of the
singular values on the diagonal, as many

374
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
singular values on the diagonal, as many
 

375
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,590
singular values on the diagonal, as many
singular values as I have. And what's

376
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
singular values as I have. And what's
 

377
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,670
singular values as I have. And what's
the rest going to be? It's going to be

378
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
the rest going to be? It's going to be
 

379
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,990
the rest going to be? It's going to be
all zeros, right?

380
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
all zeros, right?
 

381
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,470
all zeros, right?
And then I have this lambda time I which

382
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
And then I have this lambda time I which
 

383
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,150
And then I have this lambda time I which
is also diagonal. So the sum of these

384
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
is also diagonal. So the sum of these
 

385
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,910
is also diagonal. So the sum of these
things to is going to be diagonal. And

386
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
things to is going to be diagonal. And
 

387
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,990
things to is going to be diagonal. And
so I'll either have a singular value

388
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
so I'll either have a singular value
 

389
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,710
so I'll either have a singular value
squared plus lambda or I'll just have

390
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
squared plus lambda or I'll just have
 

391
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,389
squared plus lambda or I'll just have
that lambda. Does everyone see that when

392
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
that lambda. Does everyone see that when
 

393
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,710
that lambda. Does everyone see that when
I add those two matrices together? So

394
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
I add those two matrices together? So
 

395
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,150
I add those two matrices together? So
what I'm going to have is something of

396
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
what I'm going to have is something of
 

397
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,750
what I'm going to have is something of
this form.

398
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760

 

399
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,430

And then I'm going to have some lambdas

400
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
And then I'm going to have some lambdas
 

401
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,269
And then I'm going to have some lambdas
here based on how these dimensions

402
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
here based on how these dimensions
 

403
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:10,870
here based on how these dimensions
actually work out.

404
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880

 

405
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,310

And this is all inverse.

406
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
And this is all inverse.
 

407
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,310
And this is all inverse.
So what this means is when I try to

408
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
So what this means is when I try to
 

409
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,910
So what this means is when I try to
write out my w star,

410
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
write out my w star,
 

411
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,310
write out my w star,
what do I get? I can write it

412
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
what do I get? I can write it
 

413
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,430
what do I get? I can write it
as vi coming from this v here. This V

414
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
as vi coming from this v here. This V
 

415
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,750
as vi coming from this v here. This V
here gives me the VI.

416
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
here gives me the VI.
 

417
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,630
here gives me the VI.
Sigma I divided by sigma I^ 2 + lambda

418
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
Sigma I divided by sigma I^ 2 + lambda
 

419
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,670
Sigma I divided by sigma I^ 2 + lambda
times

420
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680

 

421
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,990

ui transpose time

422
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
ui transpose time
 

423
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,350
ui transpose time
y and how many terms are going to be in

424
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
y and how many terms are going to be in
 

425
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,110
y and how many terms are going to be in
this sum?

426
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120

 

427
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,710

Basically I'm going down the diagonal,

428
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
Basically I'm going down the diagonal,
 

429
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,750
Basically I'm going down the diagonal,
right? So whatever my dimension is.

430
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:01,760

 

431
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,110

So what do I see here in this particular

432
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
So what do I see here in this particular
 

433
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,870
So what do I see here in this particular
setup?

434
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
setup?
 

435
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,550
setup?
If I look at this now

436
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
If I look at this now
 

437
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,590
If I look at this now
this particular quantity is what is

438
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
this particular quantity is what is
 

439
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,230
this particular quantity is what is
governing the scaling. So I'm thinking

440
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
governing the scaling. So I'm thinking
 

441
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,509
governing the scaling. So I'm thinking
of this this uranspose y this is a

442
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
of this this uranspose y this is a
 

443
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,630
of this this uranspose y this is a
scalar. Does everyone see that

444
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
scalar. Does everyone see that
 

445
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,190
scalar. Does everyone see that
this is a scaler? So now I'm basically

446
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
this is a scaler? So now I'm basically
 

447
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,389
this is a scaler? So now I'm basically
looking at my W star as in the SVD basis

448
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
looking at my W star as in the SVD basis
 

449
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,790
looking at my W star as in the SVD basis
and these are the coefficients

450
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
and these are the coefficients
 

451
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,069
and these are the coefficients
for every single singular vector of my

452
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
for every single singular vector of my
 

453
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,990
for every single singular vector of my
matrix. Everyone see that? Because these

454
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
matrix. Everyone see that? Because these
 

455
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,230
matrix. Everyone see that? Because these
are just scalers.

456
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
are just scalers.
 

457
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,829
are just scalers.
So what is going to happen to

458
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
So what is going to happen to
 

459
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,710
So what is going to happen to
sigma i over sigma i^ 2 plus lambda if

460
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
sigma i over sigma i^ 2 plus lambda if
 

461
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,269
sigma i over sigma i^ 2 plus lambda if
um lambda is much much bigger than sigma

462
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
um lambda is much much bigger than sigma
 

463
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,310
um lambda is much much bigger than sigma
like sigma is like one and lambda is a

464
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
like sigma is like one and lambda is a
 

465
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,949
like sigma is like one and lambda is a
million for example

466
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
million for example
 

467
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,790
million for example
what is this quantity going to become

468
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
what is this quantity going to become
 

469
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,870
what is this quantity going to become
if lambda is really large basically

470
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
if lambda is really large basically
 

471
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,629
if lambda is really large basically
lambda is going to dominate and this

472
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
lambda is going to dominate and this
 

473
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,150
lambda is going to dominate and this
thing is going to become smaller and

474
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
thing is going to become smaller and
 

475
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,829
thing is going to become smaller and
smaller and smaller, right? It's going

476
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
smaller and smaller, right? It's going
 

477
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,870
smaller and smaller, right? It's going
to kind of tend to zero

478
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
to kind of tend to zero
 

479
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,389
to kind of tend to zero
as lambda goes to infinity, right? For a

480
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
as lambda goes to infinity, right? For a
 

481
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,430
as lambda goes to infinity, right? For a
fixed sigma i.

482
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
fixed sigma i.
 

483
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,230
fixed sigma i.
So what this means is that if I have

484
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
So what this means is that if I have
 

485
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,350
So what this means is that if I have
some small singular values compared to

486
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
some small singular values compared to
 

487
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,829
some small singular values compared to
my ridge regularization parameter

488
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
my ridge regularization parameter
 

489
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,310
my ridge regularization parameter
lambda, what's going to happen is that

490
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
lambda, what's going to happen is that
 

491
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,629
lambda, what's going to happen is that
are those vectors going to really show

492
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
are those vectors going to really show
 

493
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,710
are those vectors going to really show
up in my optimal solution? No. There

494
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
up in my optimal solution? No. There
 

495
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,629
up in my optimal solution? No. There
those components are just decaying away,

496
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
those components are just decaying away,
 

497
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,990
those components are just decaying away,
right?

498
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
right?
 

499
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,310
right?
Whereas on the other hand, what happens

500
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
Whereas on the other hand, what happens
 

501
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,230
Whereas on the other hand, what happens
to this sigma i^ 2 plus lambda when I

502
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:50,240
to this sigma i^ 2 plus lambda when I
 

503
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,990
to this sigma i^ 2 plus lambda when I
have u sigma i is much bigger than

504
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,000
have u sigma i is much bigger than
 

505
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,310
have u sigma i is much bigger than
lambda. Well, then this just behaves

506
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
lambda. Well, then this just behaves
 

507
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,350
lambda. Well, then this just behaves
like 1 / sigma i,

508
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
like 1 / sigma i,
 

509
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,829
like 1 / sigma i,
right? Because I have a sigma i over

510
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
right? Because I have a sigma i over
 

511
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,750
right? Because I have a sigma i over
sigma i squar approximately this is like

512
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
sigma i squar approximately this is like
 

513
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,949
sigma i squar approximately this is like
1 over sigma i. So I'm going to get that

514
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
1 over sigma i. So I'm going to get that
 

515
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,389
1 over sigma i. So I'm going to get that
component there. And what this means is

516
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
component there. And what this means is
 

517
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,269
component there. And what this means is
that the directions that have low

518
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
that the directions that have low
 

519
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,230
that the directions that have low
singular values

520
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
singular values
 

521
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,790
singular values
don't show up in your optimal solution

522
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:18,800
don't show up in your optimal solution
 

523
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,190
don't show up in your optimal solution
with ridge. Right? And by varying

524
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,200
with ridge. Right? And by varying
 

525
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,629
with ridge. Right? And by varying
lambda, you can vary how easy it is for

526
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
lambda, you can vary how easy it is for
 

527
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,350
lambda, you can vary how easy it is for
those low singular values to show up.

528
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
those low singular values to show up.
 

529
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,350
those low singular values to show up.
Now what are those directions? When you

530
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
Now what are those directions? When you
 

531
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,829
Now what are those directions? When you
think intuitively about what does it

532
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
think intuitively about what does it
 

533
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,389
think intuitively about what does it
mean for a particular direction to have

534
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
mean for a particular direction to have
 

535
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,910
mean for a particular direction to have
a

536
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
a
 

537
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,350
a
low singular value. So take a minute and

538
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
low singular value. So take a minute and
 

539
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,829
low singular value. So take a minute and
like find a person next to you and talk

540
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
like find a person next to you and talk
 

541
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,269
like find a person next to you and talk
to them about this. What does it mean

542
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:43,279
to them about this. What does it mean
 

543
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,949
to them about this. What does it mean
when a direction is a low singular value

544
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:44,959
when a direction is a low singular value
 

545
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,069
when a direction is a low singular value
or a high singular? I'm going to give

546
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
or a high singular? I'm going to give
 

547
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:57,040
or a high singular? I'm going to give
you one minute to actually talk.

548
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,050

 

549
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:07,509

[Music]

550
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519

 

551
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:15,080

Yeah.

552
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,090

 

553
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:24,310

[Applause]

554
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320

 

555
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:37,189

30 minutes.

556
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199

 

557
00:14:37,199 --> 00:15:03,509

And that was

558
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519

 

559
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,030

Okay, that's a minute.

560
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
Okay, that's a minute.
 

561
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,750
Okay, that's a minute.
That's one minute. So, if you want these

562
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760
That's one minute. So, if you want these
 

563
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,990
That's one minute. So, if you want these
breaks to talk, then you have to stop

564
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
breaks to talk, then you have to stop
 

565
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,590
breaks to talk, then you have to stop
when I say stop. Otherwise, we'll never

566
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
when I say stop. Otherwise, we'll never
 

567
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,750
when I say stop. Otherwise, we'll never
finish. Okay. So, what is the impact of

568
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:15,760
finish. Okay. So, what is the impact of
 

569
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,590
finish. Okay. So, what is the impact of
having a

570
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
having a
 

571
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,829
having a
um what what does it mean to have a

572
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
um what what does it mean to have a
 

573
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,189
um what what does it mean to have a
small singular value? What does that

574
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:21,199
small singular value? What does that
 

575
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,470
small singular value? What does that
mean for those directions in terms of

576
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
mean for those directions in terms of
 

577
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,230
mean for those directions in terms of
the data?

578
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
the data?
 

579
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,870
the data?
Yeah,

580
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:24,880
Yeah,
 

581
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,910
Yeah,
>> low variance.

582
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
>> low variance.
 

583
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,829
>> low variance.
>> Low variance, right? So the large

584
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
>> Low variance, right? So the large
 

585
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,389
>> Low variance, right? So the large
singular values capture directions that

586
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
singular values capture directions that
 

587
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,910
singular values capture directions that
have a lot of variance in the data. The

588
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
have a lot of variance in the data. The
 

589
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,430
have a lot of variance in the data. The
small singular values are the ones that

590
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
small singular values are the ones that
 

591
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,189
small singular values are the ones that
don't have that that much variance in

592
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
don't have that that much variance in
 

593
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,670
don't have that that much variance in
the data. So what that means is that

594
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
the data. So what that means is that
 

595
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,189
the data. So what that means is that
when you look at your data points,

596
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
when you look at your data points,
 

597
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,350
when you look at your data points,
right, what is X made of? X is made of

598
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
right, what is X made of? X is made of
 

599
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,189
right, what is X made of? X is made of
basically the rows of X are your data

600
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
basically the rows of X are your data
 

601
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,150
basically the rows of X are your data
points. Those directions that are not

602
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
points. Those directions that are not
 

603
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,389
points. Those directions that are not
represented in the data are the

604
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
represented in the data are the
 

605
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,949
represented in the data are the
directions that have small singular

606
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
directions that have small singular
 

607
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,030
directions that have small singular
values.

608
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
values.
 

609
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,790
values.
So if you don't have a lot of

610
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
So if you don't have a lot of
 

611
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,590
So if you don't have a lot of
information about particular directions,

612
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
information about particular directions,
 

613
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,069
information about particular directions,
maybe you shouldn't actually be paying

614
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:00,079
maybe you shouldn't actually be paying
 

615
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,030
maybe you shouldn't actually be paying
too much attention to those when you're

616
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
too much attention to those when you're
 

617
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,189
too much attention to those when you're
trying to fit your function. Remember we

618
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
trying to fit your function. Remember we
 

619
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,189
trying to fit your function. Remember we
started talking about ridge because

620
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
started talking about ridge because
 

621
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,310
started talking about ridge because
ridge or regularization in general is a

622
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
ridge or regularization in general is a
 

623
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,910
ridge or regularization in general is a
common solution to the problem of

624
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
common solution to the problem of
 

625
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,829
common solution to the problem of
overfitting. Where does overfitting

626
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
overfitting. Where does overfitting
 

627
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,790
overfitting. Where does overfitting
happen? When you're too married to your

628
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
happen? When you're too married to your
 

629
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,389
happen? When you're too married to your
particular training data points because

630
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
particular training data points because
 

631
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,829
particular training data points because
you're like, "Oh my gosh, I love my

632
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
you're like, "Oh my gosh, I love my
 

633
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,509
you're like, "Oh my gosh, I love my
training data. I'm so happy to have it.

634
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
training data. I'm so happy to have it.
 

635
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,949
training data. I'm so happy to have it.
let me try to fit it absolutely

636
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
let me try to fit it absolutely
 

637
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,509
let me try to fit it absolutely
perfectly. But you fit in these

638
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
perfectly. But you fit in these
 

639
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,150
perfectly. But you fit in these
directions that miss maybe aren't, you

640
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
directions that miss maybe aren't, you
 

641
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,670
directions that miss maybe aren't, you
know, really representative. You're just

642
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
know, really representative. You're just
 

643
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,910
know, really representative. You're just
fitting some noise and it reduces your

644
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
fitting some noise and it reduces your
 

645
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,430
fitting some noise and it reduces your
generalization. It reduces your

646
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
generalization. It reduces your
 

647
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,310
generalization. It reduces your
performance on the test data.

648
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
performance on the test data.
 

649
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,870
performance on the test data.
So by ignoring the directions or putting

650
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
So by ignoring the directions or putting
 

651
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,230
So by ignoring the directions or putting
less weight on the directions that have

652
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
less weight on the directions that have
 

653
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,069
less weight on the directions that have
low variability, you can actually

654
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
low variability, you can actually
 

655
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,590
low variability, you can actually
improve your performance, right? And

656
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
improve your performance, right? And
 

657
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,110
improve your performance, right? And
that's why regularization in general is

658
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
that's why regularization in general is
 

659
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,629
that's why regularization in general is
um can be a very good thing. So

660
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
um can be a very good thing. So
 

661
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,550
um can be a very good thing. So
regularization is not just about

662
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
regularization is not just about
 

663
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,069
regularization is not just about
incorporating some kind of side

664
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
incorporating some kind of side
 

665
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,389
incorporating some kind of side
information about your data. For

666
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399
information about your data. For
 

667
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,030
information about your data. For
example, you know that your true vector

668
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040
example, you know that your true vector
 

669
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,710
example, you know that your true vector
might be small or if you use ton of

670
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
might be small or if you use ton of
 

671
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,990
might be small or if you use ton of
maybe you know that your true vector is

672
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
maybe you know that your true vector is
 

673
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,150
maybe you know that your true vector is
close to some other vector or you know

674
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
close to some other vector or you know
 

675
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,390
close to some other vector or you know
something about specific components. But

676
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
something about specific components. But
 

677
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,949
something about specific components. But
what it's trying to say is that look you

678
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
what it's trying to say is that look you
 

679
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,309
what it's trying to say is that look you
know maybe you don't want to move in

680
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
know maybe you don't want to move in
 

681
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,549
know maybe you don't want to move in
those directions where there are um low

682
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
those directions where there are um low
 

683
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,270
those directions where there are um low
singular values. Okay

684
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
singular values. Okay
 

685
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,750
singular values. Okay
make sense to everyone.

686
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
make sense to everyone.
 

687
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,590
make sense to everyone.
So what I want to remind you now if I

688
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
So what I want to remind you now if I
 

689
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,429
So what I want to remind you now if I
look at for example my gradient descent

690
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
look at for example my gradient descent
 

691
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,350
look at for example my gradient descent
update this is what it looks like for

692
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
update this is what it looks like for
 

693
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,270
update this is what it looks like for
um again the just the le squares problem

694
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
um again the just the le squares problem
 

695
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,110
um again the just the le squares problem
here I'm not thinking about rich I'm not

696
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
here I'm not thinking about rich I'm not
 

697
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,669
here I'm not thinking about rich I'm not
regularizing it but what you'll notice

698
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
regularizing it but what you'll notice
 

699
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,029
regularizing it but what you'll notice
here is that there's this xrpose that

700
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:35,039
here is that there's this xrpose that
 

701
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,310
here is that there's this xrpose that
multiplies this vector here right and so

702
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,320
multiplies this vector here right and so
 

703
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,390
multiplies this vector here right and so
this vector

704
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400

 

705
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,190

this vector is basically your residual

706
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
this vector is basically your residual
 

707
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,510
this vector is basically your residual
right or your error that you're

708
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
right or your error that you're
 

709
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,029
right or your error that you're
when you're currently predicting your

710
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
when you're currently predicting your
 

711
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,070
when you're currently predicting your
current best guess is wt and so x wt

712
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
current best guess is wt and so x wt
 

713
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,470
current best guess is wt and so x wt
minus y is how bad are you at predicting

714
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
minus y is how bad are you at predicting
 

715
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,190
minus y is how bad are you at predicting
y on your training data

716
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,200
y on your training data
 

717
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,630
y on your training data
and what is xrpose xrpose is your data

718
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
and what is xrpose xrpose is your data
 

719
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,669
and what is xrpose xrpose is your data
so basically what this says is that my

720
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
so basically what this says is that my
 

721
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,150
so basically what this says is that my
gradient descent will always take a step

722
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
gradient descent will always take a step
 

723
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,350
gradient descent will always take a step
only in the span of the data I can never

724
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
only in the span of the data I can never
 

725
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,990
only in the span of the data I can never
leave the span of the data does is that

726
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,000
leave the span of the data does is that
 

727
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,669
leave the span of the data does is that
clear using gradient descent so always

728
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
clear using gradient descent so always
 

729
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,270
clear using gradient descent so always
remains

730
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:21,280

 

731
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,310

in the span assuming you initialize at

732
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
in the span assuming you initialize at
 

733
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,390
in the span assuming you initialize at
zero

734
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400

 

735
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,909

of the data.

736
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919

 

737
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,430

The other thing that I'll briefly

738
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
The other thing that I'll briefly
 

739
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,909
The other thing that I'll briefly
mention because it might come up later.

740
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
mention because it might come up later.
 

741
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,990
mention because it might come up later.
If I look at the gradient descent update

742
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
If I look at the gradient descent update
 

743
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,350
If I look at the gradient descent update
for a ridge,

744
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
for a ridge,
 

745
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,990
for a ridge,
it has a similar property

746
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
it has a similar property
 

747
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,830
it has a similar property
and I have wt + 1 is equal to

748
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:53,840
and I have wt + 1 is equal to
 

749
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,430
and I have wt + 1 is equal to
um

750
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
um
 

751
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,190
um
1 - 2 a lambda

752
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200

 

753
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:11,669

- 2 a times

754
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679

 

755
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,630

So basically when I look at this um

756
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
So basically when I look at this um
 

757
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,110
So basically when I look at this um
gradient descent update for ridge, what

758
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
gradient descent update for ridge, what
 

759
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,390
gradient descent update for ridge, what
I have here is this extra term

760
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
I have here is this extra term
 

761
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:33,270
I have here is this extra term
on the WT. If I compare it to the

762
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280

 

763
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,029

I don't see a siren blaring telling us

764
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
I don't see a siren blaring telling us
 

765
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,110
I don't see a siren blaring telling us
to get out of the room. So I think we

766
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
to get out of the room. So I think we
 

767
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,590
to get out of the room. So I think we
can continue.

768
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600

 

769
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,070

So if I didn't if my lambda was zero,

770
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
So if I didn't if my lambda was zero,
 

771
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,669
So if I didn't if my lambda was zero,
I'm just at back at gradient descent,

772
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
I'm just at back at gradient descent,
 

773
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,590
I'm just at back at gradient descent,
right?

774
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
right?
 

775
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,669
right?
What is this doing? What is this term

776
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
What is this doing? What is this term
 

777
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,870
What is this doing? What is this term
doing? This is coming from the

778
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
doing? This is coming from the
 

779
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,870
doing? This is coming from the
regularization.

780
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
regularization.
 

781
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,190
regularization.
And what it's saying is look every time

782
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
And what it's saying is look every time
 

783
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,150
And what it's saying is look every time
maybe just like down weight a little bit

784
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
maybe just like down weight a little bit
 

785
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,190
maybe just like down weight a little bit
on WT right it's pulling down the weight

786
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,200
on WT right it's pulling down the weight
 

787
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,549
on WT right it's pulling down the weight
it used to in gradient descent this

788
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
it used to in gradient descent this
 

789
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,470
it used to in gradient descent this
would be one this is saying do something

790
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
would be one this is saying do something
 

791
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,310
would be one this is saying do something
slightly less than one okay

792
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
slightly less than one okay
 

793
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,430
slightly less than one okay
and so this term is called sometimes

794
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
and so this term is called sometimes
 

795
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,430
and so this term is called sometimes
uh weight decay

796
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,440

 

797
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,590

and what you'll see is that uh we

798
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
and what you'll see is that uh we
 

799
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,150
and what you'll see is that uh we
haven't what you'll see is that gradient

800
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,160
haven't what you'll see is that gradient
 

801
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,789
haven't what you'll see is that gradient
descent actually has this implicit

802
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799
descent actually has this implicit
 

803
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,390
descent actually has this implicit
regularization property that I'm going

804
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
regularization property that I'm going
 

805
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,789
regularization property that I'm going
to talk about in just a minute and so

806
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
to talk about in just a minute and so
 

807
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,270
to talk about in just a minute and so
often when you're implementing

808
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
often when you're implementing
 

809
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,230
often when you're implementing
uh gradient descent in deep learning we

810
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240
uh gradient descent in deep learning we
 

811
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,390
uh gradient descent in deep learning we
will not actually have an explicit

812
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
will not actually have an explicit
 

813
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,909
will not actually have an explicit
regularization

814
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
regularization
 

815
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,070
regularization
we will not include a ridge parameter or

816
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
we will not include a ridge parameter or
 

817
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,149
we will not include a ridge parameter or
a lasso parameter or anything like that

818
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
a lasso parameter or anything like that
 

819
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,990
a lasso parameter or anything like that
and even then there will be a

820
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
and even then there will be a
 

821
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,230
and even then there will be a
regularizing effect and there are other

822
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
regularizing effect and there are other
 

823
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,029
regularizing effect and there are other
tricks that we can use by which we can

824
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
tricks that we can use by which we can
 

825
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,430
tricks that we can use by which we can
avoid overfitting even though we might

826
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
avoid overfitting even though we might
 

827
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,190
avoid overfitting even though we might
not have an explicit regularization. So

828
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
not have an explicit regularization. So
 

829
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,789
not have an explicit regularization. So
I'm going to talk about that next.

830
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
I'm going to talk about that next.
 

831
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,470
I'm going to talk about that next.
However, sometimes there are other

832
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480
However, sometimes there are other
 

833
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,390
However, sometimes there are other
benefits to not having your weights get

834
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
benefits to not having your weights get
 

835
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,029
benefits to not having your weights get
too large. And so sometimes even though

836
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:05,039
too large. And so sometimes even though
 

837
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,710
too large. And so sometimes even though
you won't have a ridge term in your

838
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
you won't have a ridge term in your
 

839
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,750
you won't have a ridge term in your
loss, what you will do is you will

840
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
loss, what you will do is you will
 

841
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,750
loss, what you will do is you will
include some kind of weight decay

842
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:11,760
include some kind of weight decay
 

843
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,789
include some kind of weight decay
schedule that will you know just kind of

844
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,799
schedule that will you know just kind of
 

845
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,630
schedule that will you know just kind of
keep pulling your weights down by a

846
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
keep pulling your weights down by a
 

847
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,070
keep pulling your weights down by a
little bit to avoid them from getting

848
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
little bit to avoid them from getting
 

849
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,909
little bit to avoid them from getting
too big. So this is another thing that

850
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
too big. So this is another thing that
 

851
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,830
too big. So this is another thing that
this is a piece of terminology that I

852
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
this is a piece of terminology that I
 

853
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,750
this is a piece of terminology that I
wanted to put out there that sometimes

854
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:23,760
wanted to put out there that sometimes
 

855
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,149
wanted to put out there that sometimes
regularization weight decay and now what

856
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
regularization weight decay and now what
 

857
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,990
regularization weight decay and now what
I'm going to talk about as implicit

858
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm going to talk about as implicit
 

859
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,750
I'm going to talk about as implicit
regularization and early stopping of

860
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760
regularization and early stopping of
 

861
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,750
regularization and early stopping of
gradient descent are all talked about

862
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
gradient descent are all talked about
 

863
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,270
gradient descent are all talked about
sometimes in the same breath and

864
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
sometimes in the same breath and
 

865
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,590
sometimes in the same breath and
sometimes interchangeably and they all

866
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
sometimes interchangeably and they all
 

867
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,070
sometimes interchangeably and they all
mean the spiritually same idea

868
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
mean the spiritually same idea
 

869
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,549
mean the spiritually same idea
implemented in slightly different ways.

870
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
implemented in slightly different ways.
 

871
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,950
implemented in slightly different ways.
So what I want you to understand is that

872
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
So what I want you to understand is that
 

873
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,549
So what I want you to understand is that
whatever when someone's talking about

874
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
whatever when someone's talking about
 

875
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,990
whatever when someone's talking about
this that's the kind of idea that

876
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,000
this that's the kind of idea that
 

877
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,390
this that's the kind of idea that
they're talking about. Okay, everyone

878
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,400
they're talking about. Okay, everyone
 

879
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,310
they're talking about. Okay, everyone
with me? Questions? Okay, good.

880
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,320
with me? Questions? Okay, good.
 

881
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,710
with me? Questions? Okay, good.
So now let's go back to gradient

882
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
So now let's go back to gradient
 

883
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,549
So now let's go back to gradient
descent. And now what I want to get to

884
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559
descent. And now what I want to get to
 

885
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,750
descent. And now what I want to get to
is this implicit regularization.

886
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760

 

887
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:09,510

And what do I mean by that?

888
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520

 

889
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,190

So, I'm going to take again um my

890
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
So, I'm going to take again um my
 

891
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,630
So, I'm going to take again um my
gradient descent update equation and I'm

892
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
gradient descent update equation and I'm
 

893
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,310
gradient descent update equation and I'm
going to write it out. But now I'm going

894
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,320
going to write it out. But now I'm going
 

895
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,789
going to write it out. But now I'm going
to write it out in my SVD basis.

896
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:24,799

 

897
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,950

So to write it out in my SVD basis, I'm

898
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:26,960
So to write it out in my SVD basis, I'm
 

899
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,390
So to write it out in my SVD basis, I'm
just going to do a change of basis.

900
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:28,400
just going to do a change of basis.
 

901
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,789
just going to do a change of basis.
Multiply by VRpose.

902
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799

 

903
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,630

So I'm multiplying the whole equation by

904
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:34,640
So I'm multiplying the whole equation by
 

905
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,390
So I'm multiplying the whole equation by
VRpose. This xrpose I'm going to replace

906
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
VRpose. This xrpose I'm going to replace
 

907
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,990
VRpose. This xrpose I'm going to replace
with the svd. So I get a v sigma

908
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
with the svd. So I get a v sigma
 

909
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,669
with the svd. So I get a v sigma
transpose

910
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
transpose
 

911
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,190
transpose
u uranspose

912
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200
u uranspose
 

913
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,630
u uranspose
and then I have this x wt

914
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,640
and then I have this x wt
 

915
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,390
and then I have this x wt
minus y.

916
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400

 

917
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,710

And so when this I change bases into

918
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
And so when this I change bases into
 

919
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,230
And so when this I change bases into
this new coordinate. Let me call this

920
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
this new coordinate. Let me call this
 

921
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:07,029
this new coordinate. Let me call this
new vector w tilda. Let's say

922
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:07,039

 

923
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,789

so now I'm this new basis minus 2 ADA.

924
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799
so now I'm this new basis minus 2 ADA.
 

925
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,149
so now I'm this new basis minus 2 ADA.
These vranspose V's cancel.

926
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
These vranspose V's cancel.
 

927
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,310
These vranspose V's cancel.
Um

928
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,320

 

929
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,510

so then I have this sigma transpose and

930
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
so then I have this sigma transpose and
 

931
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,990
so then I have this sigma transpose and
then I can pull this urpose into here I

932
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
then I can pull this urpose into here I
 

933
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,710
then I can pull this urpose into here I
have a U sigma

934
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:32,720

 

935
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,590

V transpose WT

936
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:35,600
V transpose WT
 

937
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,510
V transpose WT
minus URPOSE Y.

938
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,520
minus URPOSE Y.
 

939
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,990
minus URPOSE Y.
This is equal to then

940
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
This is equal to then
 

941
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,310
This is equal to then
W tilda T transpose minus 2 ADA. These

942
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
W tilda T transpose minus 2 ADA. These
 

943
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,350
W tilda T transpose minus 2 ADA. These
uranspose U's cancel. This thing I'm

944
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
uranspose U's cancel. This thing I'm
 

945
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,230
uranspose U's cancel. This thing I'm
going to pull into becoming another W

946
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
going to pull into becoming another W
 

947
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,669
going to pull into becoming another W
tilda because now this is just

948
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:55,679
tilda because now this is just
 

949
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,390
tilda because now this is just
expressing my old WT in the SVD basis.

950
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
expressing my old WT in the SVD basis.
 

951
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,510
expressing my old WT in the SVD basis.
Everyone see that?

952
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520

 

953
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,230

So then I have a sigma transpose

954
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,240
So then I have a sigma transpose
 

955
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,029
So then I have a sigma transpose
sigma w

956
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:11,039
sigma w
 

957
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,029
sigma w
tilda t

958
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
tilda t
 

959
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:20,710
tilda t
minus uranspose y.

960
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:20,720

 

961
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,909

So now what has happened by me writing

962
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:23,919
So now what has happened by me writing
 

963
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,470
So now what has happened by me writing
this in the svd basis? Let me look at

964
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,480
this in the svd basis? Let me look at
 

965
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,310
this in the svd basis? Let me look at
this. Right? This is a vector. But what

966
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
this. Right? This is a vector. But what
 

967
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,750
this. Right? This is a vector. But what
has happened to this thing? What kind of

968
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
has happened to this thing? What kind of
 

969
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,149
has happened to this thing? What kind of
matrix is this?

970
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
matrix is this?
 

971
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,950
matrix is this?
This is again a diagonal matrix, right?

972
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
This is again a diagonal matrix, right?
 

973
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,149
This is again a diagonal matrix, right?
This is a diagonal matrix. So now when I

974
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
This is a diagonal matrix. So now when I
 

975
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,789
This is a diagonal matrix. So now when I
look at the different components of WT,

976
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
look at the different components of WT,
 

977
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,710
look at the different components of WT,
they're no longer coupled, right? By

978
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,720
they're no longer coupled, right? By
 

979
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,870
they're no longer coupled, right? By
transforming into the SVD basis, I've

980
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:44,880
transforming into the SVD basis, I've
 

981
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,110
transforming into the SVD basis, I've
basically diagonalized my problem. And

982
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,120
basically diagonalized my problem. And
 

983
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,269
basically diagonalized my problem. And
now I can look at this component by

984
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:49,279
now I can look at this component by
 

985
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,669
now I can look at this component by
component. So I can basically look at

986
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:51,679
component. So I can basically look at
 

987
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:59,510
component. So I can basically look at
the E component.

988
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520

 

989
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,230

And that is 2 ADA times I basically have

990
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:02,240
And that is 2 ADA times I basically have
 

991
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,870
And that is 2 ADA times I basically have
this sigma i^ 2 w tilda t

992
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:06,880
this sigma i^ 2 w tilda t
 

993
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,950
this sigma i^ 2 w tilda t
minus

994
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
minus
 

995
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,190
minus
sigma i and then whatever is the

996
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
sigma i and then whatever is the
 

997
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,630
sigma i and then whatever is the
component I'm just going to call this y

998
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
component I'm just going to call this y
 

999
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,470
component I'm just going to call this y
i twiddle

1000
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:14,480
i twiddle
 

1001
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,070
i twiddle
right I don't really care about this is

1002
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,080
right I don't really care about this is
 

1003
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:23,110
right I don't really care about this is
just some scalar here

1004
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,120

 

1005
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,630

so what do I notice when I look at this

1006
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640

 

1007
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,350

this singular value

1008
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
this singular value
 

1009
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,149
this singular value
is showing up right

1010
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
is showing up right
 

1011
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,789
is showing up right
and so when I'm taking so this is the

1012
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:36,799
and so when I'm taking so this is the
 

1013
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,669
and so when I'm taking so this is the
step that I'm taking in the direction of

1014
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:41,679
step that I'm taking in the direction of
 

1015
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,789
step that I'm taking in the direction of
the i singular vector does everyone see

1016
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
the i singular vector does everyone see
 

1017
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,710
the i singular vector does everyone see
that now we've projected into that basis

1018
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,720
that now we've projected into that basis
 

1019
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,549
that now we've projected into that basis
so this is the step that I'm taking

1020
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
so this is the step that I'm taking
 

1021
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,149
so this is the step that I'm taking
according to that direction everyone

1022
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
according to that direction everyone
 

1023
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,149
according to that direction everyone
with me there

1024
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:52,159
with me there
 

1025
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,669
with me there
okay

1026
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
okay
 

1027
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,909
okay
folks I need you to like give me some

1028
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:55,919
folks I need you to like give me some
 

1029
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,470
folks I need you to like give me some
feedback, thumbs up, thumbs down, like

1030
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
feedback, thumbs up, thumbs down, like
 

1031
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,630
feedback, thumbs up, thumbs down, like
because otherwise I will keep barreling

1032
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
because otherwise I will keep barreling
 

1033
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,710
because otherwise I will keep barreling
at you and you will understand nothing.

1034
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
at you and you will understand nothing.
 

1035
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,070
at you and you will understand nothing.
But if you tell me that you don't

1036
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,080
But if you tell me that you don't
 

1037
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,669
But if you tell me that you don't
understand, then there's a hope that I

1038
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
understand, then there's a hope that I
 

1039
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,269
understand, then there's a hope that I
might tell you again. I still might not,

1040
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:07,279
might tell you again. I still might not,
 

1041
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,630
might tell you again. I still might not,
but at least there's a chance, right?

1042
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:10,640
but at least there's a chance, right?
 

1043
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,549
but at least there's a chance, right?
So, you're good. Please nod. Give me

1044
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:12,559
So, you're good. Please nod. Give me
 

1045
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,669
So, you're good. Please nod. Give me
thumbs up, thumbs down.

So when you look at singular values yes

1060
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,230

and what I see is that the size of the

00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
and what I see is that the size of the
 

1087

step I can take. I pulled this singular

1090
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
step I can take. I pulled this singular
 

1091
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,029
step I can take. I pulled this singular
value inside. But maybe actually it's

1092
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:21,039
value inside. But maybe actually it's
 

1093
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,310
value inside. But maybe actually it's
even clearer to write it as wti

1094
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,320
even clearer to write it as wti
 

1095
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,710
even clearer to write it as wti
twiddle minus 2 a sigma i times sigma wt

1101
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,870

right

1102
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:40,880
right
 

1103
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,630
right
so you can think of this as your

1104
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
so you can think of this as your
 

1105
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,950
so you can think of this as your
residual you know are you already

1106
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:44,960
residual you know are you already
 

1107
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,549
residual you know are you already
matching in this direction or not but if

1108
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:46,559
matching in this direction or not but if
 

1109
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,190
matching in this direction or not but if
you're not matching how big the step you

1110
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
you're not matching how big the step you
 

1111
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,510
you're not matching how big the step you
take depends yes on your learning rate

1112
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,520
take depends yes on your learning rate
 

1113
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,190
take depends yes on your learning rate
but it also depends on the singular

1114
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,200
but it also depends on the singular
 

1115
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,549
but it also depends on the singular
value. So for the big singular values,

1116
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:56,559
value. So for the big singular values,
 

1117
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,950
value. So for the big singular values,
you're going to take big steps and for

1118
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
you're going to take big steps and for
 

1119
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,870
you're going to take big steps and for
the small singular values, you're going

1120
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:00,880
the small singular values, you're going
 

1121
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,389
the small singular values, you're going
to take small steps, right? So you're

1122
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:04,399
to take small steps, right? So you're
 

1123
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,070
to take small steps, right? So you're
going to be moving faster in some

1124
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,080
going to be moving faster in some
 

1125
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,789
going to be moving faster in some
directions than you are in others. And

1126
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:08,799
directions than you are in others. And
 

1127
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,029
directions than you are in others. And
singular values tend to vary when you

1128
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
singular values tend to vary when you
 

1129
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,789
singular values tend to vary when you
think when you just look at them for a

1130
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:12,799
think when you just look at them for a
 

1131
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,070
think when you just look at them for a
matrix, they tend to vary across orders

1132
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,080
matrix, they tend to vary across orders
 

1133
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,750
matrix, they tend to vary across orders
of magnitude. So you know you will have

1134
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:17,760
of magnitude. So you know you will have
 

1135
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,590
of magnitude. So you know you will have
singular values that are like 10 or 100

1136
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,600
singular values that are like 10 or 100
 

1137
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,750
singular values that are like 10 or 100
10 five and then you'll have some

1138
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
10 five and then you'll have some
 

1139
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,590
10 five and then you'll have some
singular values that are like 10 the

1140
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:25,600
singular values that are like 10 the
 

1141
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,630
singular values that are like 10 the
minus2 10 the minus 5 10 the minus there

1142
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
minus2 10 the minus 5 10 the minus there
 

1143
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,990
minus2 10 the minus 5 10 the minus there
they're they can be very small so

1144
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,000
they're they can be very small so
 

1145
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,630
they're they can be very small so
there's a huge variation in these and so

1146
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:32,640
there's a huge variation in these and so
 

1147
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,909
there's a huge variation in these and so
when you're plotting singular values

1148
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:33,919
when you're plotting singular values
 

1149
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,149
when you're plotting singular values
it's a good rule of thumb when you're

1150
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:36,159
it's a good rule of thumb when you're
 

1151
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,590
it's a good rule of thumb when you're
looking at these things sometimes it can

1152
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:37,600
looking at these things sometimes it can
 

1153
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,830
looking at these things sometimes it can
be useful to plot on log scale you might

1154
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:39,840
be useful to plot on log scale you might
 

1155
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,430
be useful to plot on log scale you might
not see the kind of variation that you

1156
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,440
not see the kind of variation that you
 

1157
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,789
not see the kind of variation that you
need to see when you plot on linear

1158
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799
need to see when you plot on linear
 

1159
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,470
need to see when you plot on linear
scale so just a trick to keep in mind if

1160
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:44,480
scale so just a trick to keep in mind if
 

1161
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,909
scale so just a trick to keep in mind if
you're ever trying to debug your code in

1162
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
you're ever trying to debug your code in
 

1163
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,909
you're ever trying to debug your code in
this uh in this kind of stuff.

1164
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:49,919
this uh in this kind of stuff.
 

1165
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,510
this uh in this kind of stuff.
And so what's going to happen? Let's say

1166
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,520
And so what's going to happen? Let's say
 

1167
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,110
And so what's going to happen? Let's say
I have all of these directions to

1168
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,120
I have all of these directions to
 

1169
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,389
I have all of these directions to
different directions to move in. Right?

1170
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:54,399
different directions to move in. Right?
 

1171
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,149
different directions to move in. Right?
So let's say I have just a two

1172
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:56,159
So let's say I have just a two
 

1173
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,590
So let's say I have just a two
dimensional setup and I have a really

1174
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,600
dimensional setup and I have a really
 

1175
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,230
dimensional setup and I have a really
big singular value uh this way and a

1176
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,240
big singular value uh this way and a
 

1177
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,310
big singular value uh this way and a
really small singular value that way.

1178
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,320
really small singular value that way.
 

1179
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,990
really small singular value that way.
Right? I'm going to take big steps along

1180
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,000
Right? I'm going to take big steps along
 

1181
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,750
Right? I'm going to take big steps along
this direction and I'm going to converge

1182
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:07,760
this direction and I'm going to converge
 

1183
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,389
this direction and I'm going to converge
pretty quickly along those big singular

1184
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:10,399
pretty quickly along those big singular
 

1185
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,510
pretty quickly along those big singular
values. But I still have not moved as

1186
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,520
values. But I still have not moved as
 

1187
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,990
values. But I still have not moved as
much in the other direction where the

1188
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,000
much in the other direction where the
 

1189
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,430
much in the other direction where the
singular value is small. Okay. So what

1190
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:19,440
singular value is small. Okay. So what
 

1191
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,430
singular value is small. Okay. So what
does this mean? If I let's say don't run

1192
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
does this mean? If I let's say don't run
 

1193
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,110
does this mean? If I let's say don't run
gradient descent to convergence.

1194
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,120
gradient descent to convergence.
 

1195
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,870
gradient descent to convergence.
If I somehow do what is called early

1196
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:30,880
If I somehow do what is called early
 

1197
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,430
If I somehow do what is called early
stopping of gradient descent.

1198
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,440
stopping of gradient descent.
 

1199
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,549
stopping of gradient descent.
Gradient descent naturally has this

1200
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:36,559
Gradient descent naturally has this
 

1201
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,110
Gradient descent naturally has this
property that it likes moving along

1202
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120
property that it likes moving along
 

1203
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,950
property that it likes moving along
large singular values more than it likes

1204
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
large singular values more than it likes
 

1205
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,950
large singular values more than it likes
moving along small singular values. So

1206
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
moving along small singular values. So
 

1207
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,789
moving along small singular values. So
it'll do the large singular values first

1208
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:44,799
it'll do the large singular values first
 

1209
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,310
it'll do the large singular values first
and only then later do the small

1210
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,320
and only then later do the small
 

1211
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,909
and only then later do the small
singular values. So if I stop early

1212
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:49,919
singular values. So if I stop early
 

1213
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,990
singular values. So if I stop early
without running to convergence, what's

1214
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
without running to convergence, what's
 

1215
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,630
without running to convergence, what's
going to happen is that I'm not going to

1216
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:54,640
going to happen is that I'm not going to
 

1217
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,710
going to happen is that I'm not going to
move in those directions that have small

1218
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:56,720
move in those directions that have small
 

1219
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,990
move in those directions that have small
singular values that maybe I didn't want

1220
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,000
singular values that maybe I didn't want
 

1221
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,149
singular values that maybe I didn't want
to move in anyways because that's what

1222
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:00,159
to move in anyways because that's what
 

1223
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,549
to move in anyways because that's what
my ridge was doing,

1224
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
my ridge was doing,
 

1225
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,350
my ridge was doing,
right? That's exactly

1226
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,360
right? That's exactly
 

1227
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,230
right? That's exactly
what this term is doing in ridge. I

1228
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
what this term is doing in ridge. I
 

1229
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,789
what this term is doing in ridge. I
haven't actually put any ridge par

1230
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:10,799
haven't actually put any ridge par
 

1231
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,549
haven't actually put any ridge par
regularization on this. There's no ridge

1232
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:12,559
regularization on this. There's no ridge
 

1233
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,510
regularization on this. There's no ridge
penalty. But if I say I stop early,

1234
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:17,520
penalty. But if I say I stop early,
 

1235
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,389
penalty. But if I say I stop early,
I will get the same benefit. So you you

1236
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:20,399
I will get the same benefit. So you you
 

1237
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,710
I will get the same benefit. So you you
might hear this term early stopping.

1238
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
might hear this term early stopping.
 

1239
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,230
might hear this term early stopping.
Have have people ever heard of this term

1240
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240
Have have people ever heard of this term
 

1241
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,750
Have have people ever heard of this term
early stopping in machine learning?

1242
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760

 

1243
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,230

And so early stopping doesn't literally

1244
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,240
And so early stopping doesn't literally
 

1245
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,630
And so early stopping doesn't literally
mean I mean it can it can mean just you

1246
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:34,640
mean I mean it can it can mean just you
 

1247
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,230
mean I mean it can it can mean just you
know stop doing gradients descent at a

1248
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
know stop doing gradients descent at a
 

1249
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,590
know stop doing gradients descent at a
random early point before it has

1250
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:37,600
random early point before it has
 

1251
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,149
random early point before it has
converged. But often what this means is

1252
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:40,159
converged. But often what this means is
 

1253
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,070
converged. But often what this means is
that you actually run gradient descent

1254
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
that you actually run gradient descent
 

1255
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,110
that you actually run gradient descent
for a long time and then you keep you

1256
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,120
for a long time and then you keep you
 

1257
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,269
for a long time and then you keep you
have training checkpoints for your model

1258
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:47,279
have training checkpoints for your model
 

1259
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,830
have training checkpoints for your model
and then you go back and you pick that

1260
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:49,840
and then you go back and you pick that
 

1261
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,430
and then you go back and you pick that
training checkpoint that actually

1262
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:51,440
training checkpoint that actually
 

1263
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,070
training checkpoint that actually
performs best before you start running

1264
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,080
performs best before you start running
 

1265
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,350
performs best before you start running
into the overfitting regime. So you

1266
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,360
into the overfitting regime. So you
 

1267
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,630
into the overfitting regime. So you
might have some training loss curve is

1268
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:56,640
might have some training loss curve is
 

1269
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,470
might have some training loss curve is
coming down down down down and then

1270
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:58,480
coming down down down down and then
 

1271
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,909
coming down down down down and then
maybe it starts going up because you're

1272
00:30:59,909 --> 00:30:59,919
maybe it starts going up because you're
 

1273
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,750
maybe it starts going up because you're
starting to overfit. So then you find

1274
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:01,760
starting to overfit. So then you find
 

1275
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,669
starting to overfit. So then you find
that checkpoint where you've actually

1276
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:03,679
that checkpoint where you've actually
 

1277
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,990
that checkpoint where you've actually
done the best. And now what this is

1278
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
done the best. And now what this is
 

1279
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,990
done the best. And now what this is
saying is this is giving you a reason

1280
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
saying is this is giving you a reason
 

1281
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,830
saying is this is giving you a reason

So I'm expressing gradient descent here

So I'm expressing gradient descent here

move the step size it will take in each

move the step size it will take in each
direction is proportional to the

direction is proportional to the
 

1411
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,389
direction is proportional to the
singular value in that direction. So it

1412
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:46,399
singular value in that direction. So it
 

1413
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,029
singular value in that direction. So it
will move in this way and this way but

1414
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:49,039
will move in this way and this way but
 

1415
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,590
will move in this way and this way but
the step horizontally will be this big

1416

the step horizontally will be this big
 

1417
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,669
the step horizontally will be this big
and the step vertically will be this

1418
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:53,679
and the step vertically will be this
 

1419
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,830
and the step vertically will be this
big.

1420
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:55,840

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,710
axis. Yes. Question at the back.
>> Yeah. So kind of along that line, if you

1436
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:10,720
>> Yeah. So kind of along that line, if you
 

1437
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,550
>> Yeah. So kind of along that line, if you
have a smaller singular value which

1438
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
have a smaller singular value which
 

1439
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,550
have a smaller singular value which
corresponds to you like in theory need

1440
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:16,560
corresponds to you like in theory need
 

1441
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,710
corresponds to you like in theory need
to go a shorter direction like shorter

1442
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:18,720
to go a shorter direction like shorter
 

1443
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,109
to go a shorter direction like shorter
distance in that orthogonal direction to

1444
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
distance in that orthogonal direction to
 

1445
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,710
distance in that orthogonal direction to
reach your optimum for that smaller

1446
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,720
reach your optimum for that smaller
 

1447
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,149
reach your optimum for that smaller
variance sigma. So, so you you don't so

1448
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:26,159
variance sigma. So, so you you don't so
 

1449
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,190
variance sigma. So, so you you don't so
so you're you're there the the the

1450
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,200
so you're you're there the the the
 

1451
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,270
so you're you're there the the the
residual which is the distance to your

1452
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,280
residual which is the distance to your
 

1453
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,270
residual which is the distance to your
optimum is not a function of your

1454
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,280
optimum is not a function of your
 

1455
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,750
optimum is not a function of your
singular value. That's whatever it is.

1456
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:35,760
singular value. That's whatever it is.
 

1457
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,109
singular value. That's whatever it is.
Just because your singular value is

1458
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:37,119
Just because your singular value is
 

1459
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,710
Just because your singular value is
small doesn't mean your initial is

1460
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:38,720
small doesn't mean your initial is
 

1461
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,190
small doesn't mean your initial is
somehow magically close to your that's a

1462
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,200
somehow magically close to your that's a
 

1463
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,950
somehow magically close to your that's a
function of where you've initialized.

1464
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
function of where you've initialized.
 

1465
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,190
function of where you've initialized.
Right? The question was like the small

1466
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
Right? The question was like the small
 

1467
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,950
Right? The question was like the small
singular values means you're closer to

1468
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:46,960
singular values means you're closer to
 

1469
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,550
singular values means you're closer to
your optimum in that direction or not.

1470
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:48,560
your optimum in that direction or not.
 

1471
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,349
your optimum in that direction or not.
But no.

1472
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:51,359
But no.
 

1473
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,109
But no.
Does that make sense?

1474
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,119
Does that make sense?
 

1475
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,149
Does that make sense?
>> Yeah. Okay, good. Yes, question.

1476
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:56,159
>> Yeah. Okay, good. Yes, question.
 

1477
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,270
>> Yeah. Okay, good. Yes, question.
>> Yeah, I just want to make sure that I

1478
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,280
>> Yeah, I just want to make sure that I
 

1479
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,030
>> Yeah, I just want to make sure that I
get you right. So the right intuition is

1480
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
get you right. So the right intuition is
 

1481
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,950
get you right. So the right intuition is
that for large singular value

1482
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:00,960
that for large singular value
 

1483
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,030
that for large singular value
directions, you move a proportionally

1484
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,040
directions, you move a proportionally
 

1485
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,390
directions, you move a proportionally
larger reser distance as you run

1486
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:04,400
larger reser distance as you run
 

1487
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,430
larger reser distance as you run
gradient descent early on and then as uh

1488
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:07,440
gradient descent early on and then as uh
 

1489
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,270
gradient descent early on and then as uh
those will converge first and so when

1490
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,280
those will converge first and so when
 

1491
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,870
those will converge first and so when
you keep running then you start

1492
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:10,880
you keep running then you start
 

1493
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,550
you keep running then you start
optimizing the smaller.

1494
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:12,560
optimizing the smaller.
 

1495
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,150
optimizing the smaller.
>> Exactly. Exactly. Because you you know

1496
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160
>> Exactly. Exactly. Because you you know
 

1497
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,270
>> Exactly. Exactly. Because you you know
you have you have some amount of

1498
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:15,280
you have you have some amount of
 

1499
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,710
you have you have some amount of
gradient pressure and if you can just

1500
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:16,720
gradient pressure and if you can just
 

1501
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,069
gradient pressure and if you can just
like you have to choose a direction,

1502
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:18,079
like you have to choose a direction,
 

1503
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,470
like you have to choose a direction,
right? There's a trade-off, right? You

1504
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:20,480
right? There's a trade-off, right? You
 

1505
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,630
right? There's a trade-off, right? You
know I can I can I I only have a certain

1506
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:22,640
know I can I can I I only have a certain
 

1507
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,390
know I can I can I I only have a certain
step size. I can take and I can choose

1508
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,400
step size. I can take and I can choose
 

1509
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,790
step size. I can take and I can choose
to distribute that component. I can

1510
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:26,800
to distribute that component. I can
 

1511
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,710
to distribute that component. I can
choose to distribute my vector that I'm

1512
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:28,720
choose to distribute my vector that I'm
 

1513
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,510
choose to distribute my vector that I'm
taking a step in. You know, I can have a

1514
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:31,520
taking a step in. You know, I can have a
 

1515
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,190
taking a step in. You know, I can have a
component in each orthogonal direction.

1516
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,200
component in each orthogonal direction.
 

1517
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,710
component in each orthogonal direction.
The directions of the SVD are

1518
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:34,720
The directions of the SVD are
 

1519
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,670
The directions of the SVD are
orthogonal. My step size is still fixed.

1520
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:37,680
orthogonal. My step size is still fixed.
 

1521
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,510
orthogonal. My step size is still fixed.
So, I can't have large components in

1522
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:39,520
So, I can't have large components in
 

1523
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,390
So, I can't have large components in
every direction, but proportionally the

1524
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,400
every direction, but proportionally the
 

1525
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,310
every direction, but proportionally the
large singular values will pull a larger

1526
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,320
large singular values will pull a larger
 

1527
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,550
large singular values will pull a larger
component. And so, there won't be that

1528
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:46,560
component. And so, there won't be that
 

1529
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,550
component. And so, there won't be that
much step size left to take in the

1530
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:48,560
much step size left to take in the
 

1531
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,950
much step size left to take in the
smaller direction. Okay? you have to

1532
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:50,960
smaller direction. Okay? you have to
 

1533
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,030
smaller direction. Okay? you have to
spread it across whatever dimensions you

1534
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,040
spread it across whatever dimensions you
 

1535
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,870
spread it across whatever dimensions you
have.

1536
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:54,880
have.
 

1537
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,230

1543
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,190

00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,200
that supposed to be a vector? Is that
 

1545
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,670
that supposed to be a vector? Is that
>> Yeah, that's probably not a vector.

1546
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680

 

1547
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,349

Okay, awesome. Okay, good. So with this

1548
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,359
Okay, awesome. Okay, good. So with this
 

1549
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,910
Okay, awesome. Okay, good. So with this
um basically I hope you've learned that

1550
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:17,920
um basically I hope you've learned that
 

1551
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,589
um basically I hope you've learned that
geometry matters and that it's a good

because it turns out that this intuition

stopping is something that is commonly

1566
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:40,800
stopping is something that is commonly
 

1567
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,069
stopping is something that is commonly
used in training lots of networks.

00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:44,079
used in training lots of networks.
 

1569
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,510
used in training lots of networks.
even though you might not be working

1570
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:45,520
even though you might not be working
 

1571
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,030
even though you might not be working
exactly on the le squares problem for

1572
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,040
exactly on the le squares problem for
 

1573
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,190
exactly on the le squares problem for
linear regression. So these kinds of

1574
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
linear regression. So these kinds of
 

1575
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,710
linear regression. So these kinds of
intuitions are helpful and that's kind

1576
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:50,720
intuitions are helpful and that's kind
 

1577
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,870
intuitions are helpful and that's kind
of what we're going to be building today

1578
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:52,880
of what we're going to be building today
 

1579
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,750
of what we're going to be building today
and uh and the next class. Okay, good.

1580
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:57,760
and uh and the next class. Okay, good.
 

1581
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,270
and uh and the next class. Okay, good.
So I haven't written down much about

1582
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,280
So I haven't written down much about
 

1583
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,109
So I haven't written down much about
early stopping but is everyone clear on

1584
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:01,119
early stopping but is everyone clear on
 

1585
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,349
early stopping but is everyone clear on
that? You can Google early stopping if

1586
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:03,359
that? You can Google early stopping if
 

1587
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,430
that? You can Google early stopping if
you can't find this and you'll find um

1588
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,440
you can't find this and you'll find um
 

1589
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,750
you can't find this and you'll find um
you'll find information on it as well.

00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:07,760
you'll find information on it as well.
 

1591
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,829
you'll find information on it as well.
Okay, last question. Can you explain

1592
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
Okay, last question. Can you explain
 

1593
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,910
Okay, last question. Can you explain
what the implicit

1594
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:11,920
what the implicit
 

1595
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,349
what the implicit
>> Okay. What is the implicit

1596
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:13,359
>> Okay. What is the implicit
 

1597
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,390
>> Okay. What is the implicit
regularization here?

1598
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:16,400
regularization here?
 

1599
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:24,310
regularization here?
So maybe I'll write this out.

1600
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:24,320

 

1601
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,829

Okay. So what is the implicit

1602
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:25,839
Okay. So what is the implicit
 

1603
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:33,829
Okay. So what is the implicit
regularization?

1604
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:33,839

 

1605
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,670

So in a ridge

1606
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,680
So in a ridge
 

1607
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,230
So in a ridge
if lambda is large

1608
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,240

 

1609
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,790

uh we don't move

1610
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,800

 

1611
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,710

in directions

1612
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:50,720
in directions
 

1613
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,710
in directions
of small

1614
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:54,720
of small
 

1615
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,430
of small
singular values. Actually I shouldn't

1616
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
singular values. Actually I shouldn't
 

1617
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,870
singular values. Actually I shouldn't
say we don't move. So I should say we

1618
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:00,880
say we don't move. So I should say we
 

1619
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,790
say we don't move. So I should say we
don't

1620
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:02,800
don't
 

1621
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,550
don't
have

1622
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
have
 

1623
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,069
have
large

1627
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,990

of

1628
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,000
of
 

1629
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,550
of
um

1630
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:14,560
um
 

1631
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,030
um
directions

1632
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,040
directions
 

1633
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,030
directions
with large singular with small singular

1634
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,040
with large singular with small singular
 

1635
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,349
with large singular with small singular
values in the ridge

1636
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:23,359
values in the ridge
 

1637
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,310
values in the ridge
solution. Okay, is that clear to

1638
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,320
solution. Okay, is that clear to
 

1639
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,430
solution. Okay, is that clear to
everyone? So and ridge is regularizing

1640
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,440
everyone? So and ridge is regularizing
 

1641
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,829
everyone? So and ridge is regularizing
right. So it's basically saying one

1642
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:31,839
right. So it's basically saying one
 

1643
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,430
right. So it's basically saying one
there's many lenses of looking at

1644
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:33,440
there's many lenses of looking at
 

1645
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,430
there's many lenses of looking at
regularization. One's lens by which we

1646
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:35,440
regularization. One's lens by which we
 

1647
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,510
regularization. One's lens by which we
can look at regularization is to say

1648
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:37,520
can look at regularization is to say
 

1649
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,870
can look at regularization is to say
don't move in directions of small

1650
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:38,880
don't move in directions of small
 

1651
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,069
don't move in directions of small
singular values.

1652
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:42,079
singular values.
 

1653
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,390
singular values.
Gradient descent

1654
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:44,400
Gradient descent
 

1655
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,230
Gradient descent
with early stopping

1656
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,240

 

1657
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,150

also does not move

1658
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,160

 

1659
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,470

1660
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:58,480

00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:00,320
directions
 

1663
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,069

1665
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:09,430
of
small singular values.

1666
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:09,440

 

1667
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,510

Does that make sense?

1668
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
Does that make sense?
 

1669
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,589
Does that make sense?
So that's why this is regularizing.

1670
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:15,599
So that's why this is regularizing.
 

1671
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,670
So that's why this is regularizing.
Can we wait for office hours?

1672
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:17,680
Can we wait for office hours?
 

1673
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,950
Can we wait for office hours?

not saying don't move either. It's just
 

1683
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,230
not saying don't move either. It's just
saying you move quite a bit less. This

00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,240
saying you move quite a bit less. This
 

1685
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:33,670
saying you move quite a bit less. This

all like these are all intuitions for
 

1705
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,510
all like these are all intuitions for
getting you there, right? Yes. You're

1706
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:53,520
getting you there, right? Yes. You're
 

1707
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,109
getting you there, right? Yes. You're
moving but you're moving you know does

1708
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:55,119
moving but you're moving you know does
 

1709
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:02,790
moving but you're moving you know does
not move or moves very little

1710
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:02,800

 

1711
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,950

in directions of small singular values.

1712
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
in directions of small singular values.
 

1713
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,790
in directions of small singular values.
So yes it's not that you're not moving

1714
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
So yes it's not that you're not moving
 

1715
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,109
So yes it's not that you're not moving
at all. It's totally possible to move

1716
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,119
at all. It's totally possible to move
 

1717
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,910
at all. It's totally possible to move
small amounts but your

1718
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:11,920
small amounts but your
 

1719
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,069
small amounts but your
your step size is proportional basically

1720
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:14,079
your step size is proportional basically
 

1721
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,390
your step size is proportional basically
to the to the to the to the value to the

1722
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,400
to the to the to the to the value to the
 

1723
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,589
to the to the to the to the value to the
singular value.

1724
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:19,599
singular value.
 

1725
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,670
singular value.
Okay. Good.

1726
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:23,680

 

1727
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,030

Okay, so with that I want to now get to

1728
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,040
Okay, so with that I want to now get to
 

1729
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,550
Okay, so with that I want to now get to
the next part of optimization which I'm

1730
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:30,560
the next part of optimization which I'm
 

1731
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,710
the next part of optimization which I'm
sure you've all seen before is

1732
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:32,720
sure you've all seen before is
 

1733
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,589
sure you've all seen before is
stochastic gradient descent, right? So

1734
00:40:35,589 --> 00:40:35,599
stochastic gradient descent, right? So
 

1735
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,190
stochastic gradient descent, right? So
gradient descent is great. Gradient

1736
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,200
gradient descent is great. Gradient
 

1737
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,390
gradient descent is great. Gradient
descent works wonderfully for convex

1738
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,400
descent works wonderfully for convex
 

1739
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,150
descent works wonderfully for convex
functions,

1740
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,160
functions,
 

1741
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,430
functions,
but guess what? Like real life is hard

1742
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440
but guess what? Like real life is hard
 

1743
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,910
but guess what? Like real life is hard
and real life includes non-convex

1744
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:47,920
and real life includes non-convex
 

1745
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,190
and real life includes non-convex
functions. If everything we wanted to

1746
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,200
functions. If everything we wanted to
 

1747
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,349
functions. If everything we wanted to
optimize was convex, life would really

1748
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:51,359
optimize was convex, life would really
 

1749
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,990
optimize was convex, life would really
would be really nice. And in particular,

1750
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,000
would be really nice. And in particular,
 

1751
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,829
would be really nice. And in particular,
fitting neural networks and deep neural

1752
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:55,839
fitting neural networks and deep neural
 

1753
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,910
fitting neural networks and deep neural
networks requires

1754
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:57,920
networks requires
 

1755
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,790
networks requires
being able to optimize over long

1756
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:00,800
being able to optimize over long
 

1757
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,190
being able to optimize over long
non-convex landscapes. So what do we do?

1758
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
non-convex landscapes. So what do we do?
 

1759
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,230
non-convex landscapes. So what do we do?
Basically, SGD is um is the solution

1760
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:08,240
Basically, SGD is um is the solution
 

1761
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,710
Basically, SGD is um is the solution
that leads us to be able to um have

1762
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:10,720
that leads us to be able to um have
 

1763
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,230
that leads us to be able to um have
better generalization in these

1764
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,240
better generalization in these
 

1765
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,950
better generalization in these
non-convex landscapes. The other thing

1766
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:14,960
non-convex landscapes. The other thing
 

1767
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,790
non-convex landscapes. The other thing
about gradient descent is that when you

1768
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:16,800
about gradient descent is that when you
 

1769
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,430
about gradient descent is that when you
have lots and lots and lots of data,

1770
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:19,440
have lots and lots and lots of data,
 

1771
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,349
have lots and lots and lots of data,
computing the gradient over many many

1772
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:21,359
computing the gradient over many many
 

1773
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,109
computing the gradient over many many
many many many data points is

1774
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:23,119
many many many data points is
 

1775
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,109
many many many data points is
computationally expensive. What SGD does

1776
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,119
computationally expensive. What SGD does
 

1777
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,230
computationally expensive. What SGD does
is it gives you a way of being a little

1778
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
is it gives you a way of being a little
 

1779
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,550
is it gives you a way of being a little
bit lazy and saying I'm going to only

1780
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:32,560
bit lazy and saying I'm going to only
 

1781
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,670
bit lazy and saying I'm going to only
compute the gradient in in certain

1782
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,680
compute the gradient in in certain
 

1783
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,069
compute the gradient in in certain
spaces and over a certain subset of my

1784
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:38,079
spaces and over a certain subset of my
 

1785
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,990
spaces and over a certain subset of my
data and move in that direction. Okay,

1786
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,000
data and move in that direction. Okay,
 

1787
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,270
data and move in that direction. Okay,
so everyone here has seen some version

1788
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:45,280
so everyone here has seen some version
 

1789
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,190
so everyone here has seen some version
of state SGD before like your machine

1790
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,200
of state SGD before like your machine
 

1791
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,550
of state SGD before like your machine
learning class has covered this, right?

1792
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,560
learning class has covered this, right?
 

1793
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,230
learning class has covered this, right?
So you know the basic idea. Okay, good.

1794
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,240
So you know the basic idea. Okay, good.
 

1795
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,349
So you know the basic idea. Okay, good.
So what is SGD doing? SGD is thinking

1796
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:55,359
So what is SGD doing? SGD is thinking
 

1797
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,790
So what is SGD doing? SGD is thinking
about basically this setup where you

1798
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:58,800
about basically this setup where you
 

1799
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,670
about basically this setup where you
have a loss function here. And now I'm

1800
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:01,680
have a loss function here. And now I'm
 

1801
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,790
have a loss function here. And now I'm
calling my loss function f and theta is

1802
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:04,800
calling my loss function f and theta is
 

1803
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,630
calling my loss function f and theta is
my parameter

1804
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:06,640
my parameter
 

1805
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,390
my parameter
and I have this loss function that

1806
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:08,400
and I have this loss function that
 

1807
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,710
and I have this loss function that
decomposes as a sum of other loss

1808
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:10,720
decomposes as a sum of other loss
 

1809
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,710
decomposes as a sum of other loss
functions

1810
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:12,720
functions
 

1811
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,109
functions
and many many common loss functions that

1812
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:15,119
and many many common loss functions that
 

1813
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,870
and many many common loss functions that
we like to think about actually have

1814
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:16,880
we like to think about actually have
 

1815
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,349
we like to think about actually have
this property. So for example if I just

1816
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:19,359
this property. So for example if I just
 

1817
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,109
this property. So for example if I just
think about my standard squared loss

1818
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:21,119
think about my standard squared loss
 

1819
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,109
think about my standard squared loss
function which is our canonical you know

1820
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:23,119
function which is our canonical you know
 

1821
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,550
function which is our canonical you know
we don't know what anything is doing.

1822
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:24,560
we don't know what anything is doing.
 

1823
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,910
we don't know what anything is doing.
Let us try a loss function and

1824
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
Let us try a loss function and
 

1825
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,510
Let us try a loss function and
understand how it behaves. We always try

1826
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:27,520
understand how it behaves. We always try
 

1827
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,230
understand how it behaves. We always try
the same loss function. Well, when I

1828
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
the same loss function. Well, when I
 

1829
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,870
the same loss function. Well, when I
look at this le squares loss function, I

1830
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:32,880
look at this le squares loss function, I
 

1831
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,670
look at this le squares loss function, I
can think about it as

1832
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:35,680
can think about it as
 

1833
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,349
can think about it as
you know the argument over this is the

1834
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:37,359
you know the argument over this is the
 

1835
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,510
you know the argument over this is the
same as a normalized version of that. I

1836
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:39,520
same as a normalized version of that. I
 

1837
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,309
same as a normalized version of that. I
can just uh average the over the number

1838
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
can just uh average the over the number
 

1839
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,870
can just uh average the over the number
of data points. But this is basically

1840
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:44,880
of data points. But this is basically
 

1841
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,349
of data points. But this is basically
the same as looking at the loss per data

1842
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:47,359
the same as looking at the loss per data
 

1843
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,990
the same as looking at the loss per data
point. Right?

1844
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:50,000
point. Right?
 

1845
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,230
point. Right?
So I can think of my squared loss as

1846
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,240
So I can think of my squared loss as
 

1847
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,750
So I can think of my squared loss as
actually the loss on the first data

1848
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:53,760
actually the loss on the first data
 

1849
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,270
actually the loss on the first data
point plus the loss on the second data

1850
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:55,280
point plus the loss on the second data
 

1851
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,790
point plus the loss on the second data
point plus the loss on the third data

1852
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:56,800
point plus the loss on the third data
 

1853
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,790
point plus the loss on the third data
point. So on and so forth. So I

1854
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:58,800
point. So on and so forth. So I
 

1855
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,190
point. So on and so forth. So I
naturally have a way of taking my loss

1856
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,200
naturally have a way of taking my loss
 

1857
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,589
naturally have a way of taking my loss
function and decomposing it into this

1858
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
function and decomposing it into this
 

1859
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,270
function and decomposing it into this
sum of component loss functions.

1860
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:07,280
sum of component loss functions.
 

1861
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,990
sum of component loss functions.
Now if I wanted to take a gradient step

1862
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,000
Now if I wanted to take a gradient step
 

1863
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,150
Now if I wanted to take a gradient step
and do proper gradient descent, I had to

1864
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:12,160
and do proper gradient descent, I had to
 

1865
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,030
and do proper gradient descent, I had to
take the gradient for the loss with

1866
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,040
take the gradient for the loss with
 

1867
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,670
take the gradient for the loss with
respect to every single data point. If n

1868
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:17,680
respect to every single data point. If n
 

1869
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,470
respect to every single data point. If n
is large, that's a lot of data points.

1870
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:20,480
is large, that's a lot of data points.
 

1871
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,470
is large, that's a lot of data points.
What if instead I took the lazy approach

1872
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:22,480
What if instead I took the lazy approach
 

1873
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,990
What if instead I took the lazy approach
and I said let's just take a few of you

1874
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,000
and I said let's just take a few of you
 

1875
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,950
and I said let's just take a few of you
and you take what is called a batch or a

1876
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:28,960
and you take what is called a batch or a
 

1877
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,030
and you take what is called a batch or a
mini batch

1878
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:31,040
mini batch
 

1879
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,870
mini batch
and say instead of taking the gradient

1880
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:34,880
and say instead of taking the gradient
 

1881
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,270
and say instead of taking the gradient
over all of the data points I will take

1882
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:37,280
over all of the data points I will take
 

1883
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,390
over all of the data points I will take
the gradient over just some subset of

1884
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,400
the gradient over just some subset of
 

1885
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,550
the gradient over just some subset of
data points I'll pick B of them

1886
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:42,560
data points I'll pick B of them
 

1887
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,030
data points I'll pick B of them
uniformly at random iid

1888
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,040
uniformly at random iid
 

1889
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,670
uniformly at random iid
and this is my batch and that's the

1890
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:49,680
and this is my batch and that's the
 

1891
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,589
and this is my batch and that's the
gradient step I take everything else is

1892
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:51,599
gradient step I take everything else is
 

1893
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,750
gradient step I take everything else is
exactly the same.

1894
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:53,760
exactly the same.
 

1895
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,190
exactly the same.
So sometimes you will hear people

1896
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:55,200
So sometimes you will hear people
 

1897
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,670
So sometimes you will hear people
talking about full batch gradient

1898
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:57,680
talking about full batch gradient
 

1899
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,630
talking about full batch gradient
descent or full batch SG. Full batch SGD

1900
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:00,640
descent or full batch SG. Full batch SGD
 

1901
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,030
descent or full batch SG. Full batch SGD
is just gradient descent because you're

1902
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,040
is just gradient descent because you're
 

1903
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,829
is just gradient descent because you're
taking all of your data

1904
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:05,839
taking all of your data
 

1905
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,550
taking all of your data
um into uh and accounting for that in

1906
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:08,560
um into uh and accounting for that in
 

1907
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,069
um into uh and accounting for that in
your gradient. Okay.

1908
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:14,079

 

1909
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,270

So what this is doing is this is saying

1910
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
So what this is doing is this is saying
 

1911
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,349
So what this is doing is this is saying
ideally I have a certain gradient and I

1912
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:19,359
ideally I have a certain gradient and I
 

1913
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,870
ideally I have a certain gradient and I
would like to move in that direction.

1914
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:20,880
would like to move in that direction.
 

1915
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,550
would like to move in that direction.
Instead I'm going to move in this

1916
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,560
Instead I'm going to move in this
 

1917
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,589
Instead I'm going to move in this
direction that is you know um

1918
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:27,599
direction that is you know um
 

1919
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,630
direction that is you know um
in expectation the same but slightly

1920
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:30,640
in expectation the same but slightly
 

1921
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,150
in expectation the same but slightly
different. So I can think of it as a

1922
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,160
different. So I can think of it as a
 

1923
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,630
different. So I can think of it as a
noisy version of my gradient um instead

1924
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:34,640
noisy version of my gradient um instead
 

1925
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,069
noisy version of my gradient um instead
of moving exactly in the direction of

1926
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:36,079
of moving exactly in the direction of
 

1927
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,390
of moving exactly in the direction of
the gradient. And when I think about

1928
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,400
the gradient. And when I think about
 

1929
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,710
the gradient. And when I think about
what I'm doing in expectation, well, in

1930
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:40,720
what I'm doing in expectation, well, in
 

1931
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,790
what I'm doing in expectation, well, in
expectation, the gradient of each of

1932
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:42,800
expectation, the gradient of each of
 

1933
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,510
expectation, the gradient of each of
these is just the gradient of my true

1934
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,520
these is just the gradient of my true
 

1935
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,750
these is just the gradient of my true
function, right? Because I'm basically

1936
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,760
function, right? Because I'm basically
 

1937
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,470
function, right? Because I'm basically
to taking I'm looking at a uniform iid,

1938
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:50,480
to taking I'm looking at a uniform iid,
 

1939
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,069
to taking I'm looking at a uniform iid,
which gives me a one. If I have n

1940
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
which gives me a one. If I have n
 

1941
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,270
which gives me a one. If I have n
different data points, I have a one

1942
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:53,280
different data points, I have a one
 

1943
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,950
different data points, I have a one
overn probability of picking each of

1944
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:54,960
overn probability of picking each of
 

1945
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,349
overn probability of picking each of
these and I average over all of them.

1946
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:57,359
these and I average over all of them.
 

1947
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,430
these and I average over all of them.
That just returns to me my original

1948
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,440
That just returns to me my original
 

1949
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,069
That just returns to me my original
gradient. So on average I'm doing

1950
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:02,079
gradient. So on average I'm doing
 

1951
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,750
gradient. So on average I'm doing
exactly what gradient descent would do

1952
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:03,760
exactly what gradient descent would do
 

1953
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,630
exactly what gradient descent would do
but I'm doing it a little bit more uh

1954
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:06,640
but I'm doing it a little bit more uh
 

1955
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,910
but I'm doing it a little bit more uh
more shakily.

1956
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:09,920
more shakily.
 

1957
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,349
more shakily.
Questions on this? Everyone clear on

1958
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:11,359
Questions on this? Everyone clear on
 

1959
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,990
Questions on this? Everyone clear on
what SGD is? You should have seen this

1960
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:14,000
what SGD is? You should have seen this
 

1961
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,230
what SGD is? You should have seen this
before.

1962
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,240

 

1963
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,069

So what are some advantages of this?

1964
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:20,079
So what are some advantages of this?
 

1965
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,510
So what are some advantages of this?
Basically, we see that you know the one

1966
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
Basically, we see that you know the one
 

1967
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,589
Basically, we see that you know the one
nice thing about it is that yes, it is

1968
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:25,599
nice thing about it is that yes, it is
 

1969
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,190
nice thing about it is that yes, it is
noisy, but it still always improves the

1970
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:29,200
noisy, but it still always improves the
 

1971
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,270
noisy, but it still always improves the
fit on a subset of the data, not all of

1972
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,280
fit on a subset of the data, not all of
 

1973
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,150
fit on a subset of the data, not all of
the data. The second advantage of it is

1974
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
the data. The second advantage of it is
 

1975
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,950
the data. The second advantage of it is
that it is actually computationally

1976
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:36,960
that it is actually computationally
 

1977
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,309
that it is actually computationally
less expensive because you have to

1978
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:38,319
less expensive because you have to
 

1979
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,109
less expensive because you have to
compute fewer gradients. And the third

1980
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:41,119
compute fewer gradients. And the third
 

1981
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,109
compute fewer gradients. And the third
nice property of it is that because

1982
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:43,119
nice property of it is that because
 

1983
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,510
nice property of it is that because
you're not always going in the direction

1984
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:45,520
you're not always going in the direction
 

1985
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,990
you're not always going in the direction
of the gradient, sometimes you can

1986
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,000
of the gradient, sometimes you can
 

1987
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,309
of the gradient, sometimes you can
escape local minima and saddle points,

1988
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:50,319
escape local minima and saddle points,
 

1989
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,829
escape local minima and saddle points,
right? So let's say I have like

1990
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:51,839
right? So let's say I have like
 

1991
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,349
right? So let's say I have like
something like this where I have some

1992
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:55,359
something like this where I have some
 

1993
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,829
something like this where I have some
local minima and then a bigger ravine.

1994
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:57,839
local minima and then a bigger ravine.
 

1995
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,069
local minima and then a bigger ravine.
Gradient discount can get stuck in that

1996
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:00,079
Gradient discount can get stuck in that
 

1997
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,950
Gradient discount can get stuck in that
local minima. But stocastic gradient

1998
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:02,960
local minima. But stocastic gradient
 

1999
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,550
local minima. But stocastic gradient
descent because it's noisy sometimes it

2000
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:04,560
descent because it's noisy sometimes it
 

2001
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,870
descent because it's noisy sometimes it
will do things that are not exactly in

2002
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
will do things that are not exactly in
 

2003
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,550
will do things that are not exactly in
the direction of the optimal gradient

2004
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:08,560
the direction of the optimal gradient
 

2005
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,470
the direction of the optimal gradient
and that will allow it to get out of a

2006
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:10,480
and that will allow it to get out of a
 

2007
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,470
and that will allow it to get out of a
local minima and escape to somewhere

2008
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:12,480
local minima and escape to somewhere
 

2009
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,030
local minima and escape to somewhere
else. Okay, so that's great but

2010
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,040
else. Okay, so that's great but
 

2011
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,109
else. Okay, so that's great but
typically when you take some algorithm

2012
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:19,119
typically when you take some algorithm
 

2013
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:21,270
typically when you take some algorithm
and you add a bunch of noise to it, it

2014
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
and you add a bunch of noise to it, it
 

2015
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,510
and you add a bunch of noise to it, it
doesn't perform better, it performs

2016
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
doesn't perform better, it performs
 

2017
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,270
doesn't perform better, it performs
worse. Right? We have these nice

2018
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:25,280
worse. Right? We have these nice
 

2019
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,790
worse. Right? We have these nice
convergence guarantees for gradient

2020
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:26,800
convergence guarantees for gradient
 

2021
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,910
convergence guarantees for gradient
descent. What about SGD?

2022
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:29,920
descent. What about SGD?
 

2023
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,829
descent. What about SGD?
So in general, one of the things that if

2024
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:31,839
So in general, one of the things that if
 

2025
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,150
So in general, one of the things that if
you just read about SGD um you know

2026
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,160
you just read about SGD um you know
 

2027
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,750
you just read about SGD um you know
anywhere in a standard textbook, what

2028
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:35,760
anywhere in a standard textbook, what
 

2029
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,309
anywhere in a standard textbook, what
you will hear is that the optimization

2030
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:38,319
you will hear is that the optimization
 

2031
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,069
you will hear is that the optimization
perspective says that we need to have a

2032
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:42,079
perspective says that we need to have a
 

2033
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,230
perspective says that we need to have a
decreasing step size or a learning rate

2034
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:44,240
decreasing step size or a learning rate
 

2035
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,750
decreasing step size or a learning rate
schedule that allows for the ADA itself

2036
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:47,760
schedule that allows for the ADA itself
 

2037
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,710
schedule that allows for the ADA itself
to get smaller over time which will

2038
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:50,720
to get smaller over time which will
 

2039
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,910
to get smaller over time which will
allow SGD to converge. If you don't do

2040
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:53,920
allow SGD to converge. If you don't do
 

2041
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,710
allow SGD to converge. If you don't do
that because the gradient is noisy,

2042
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:56,720
that because the gradient is noisy,
 

2043
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,790
that because the gradient is noisy,
you'll get close to the solution. you'll

2044
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:58,800
you'll get close to the solution. you'll
 

2045
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,910
you'll get close to the solution. you'll
get close to the optimal, but then

2046
00:46:59,910 --> 00:46:59,920
get close to the optimal, but then
 

2047
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,750
get close to the optimal, but then
you'll just do this like bouncing

2048
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:01,760
you'll just do this like bouncing
 

2049
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,510
you'll just do this like bouncing
around, dancing around it because your

2050
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:03,520
around, dancing around it because your
 

2051
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,030
around, dancing around it because your
gradient is never actually hitting zero.

2052
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,040
gradient is never actually hitting zero.
 

2053
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,510
gradient is never actually hitting zero.
You're just kind of on average zero, but

2054
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:07,520
You're just kind of on average zero, but
 

2055
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,270
You're just kind of on average zero, but
you're never actually exactly zero. So

2056
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
you're never actually exactly zero. So
 

2057
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,630
you're never actually exactly zero. So
you you'll see this kind of bouncing.

2058
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:10,640
you you'll see this kind of bouncing.
 

2059
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,030
you you'll see this kind of bouncing.
And if I have time, I'll try to show you

2060
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,040
And if I have time, I'll try to show you
 

2061
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,710
And if I have time, I'll try to show you
a demo of this. We'll see if I actually

2062
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:14,720
a demo of this. We'll see if I actually
 

2063
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,430
a demo of this. We'll see if I actually
get to it.

2064
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:17,440
get to it.
 

2065
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,829
get to it.
But in practice, what you see is that

2066
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:19,839
But in practice, what you see is that
 

2067
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,990
But in practice, what you see is that
sometimes SGD can actually converge with

2068
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:22,000
sometimes SGD can actually converge with
 

2069
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,790
sometimes SGD can actually converge with
constant step sizes. And I'm going to

2070
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:24,800
constant step sizes. And I'm going to
 

2071
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,150
constant step sizes. And I'm going to
try to show you a proof uh at the end of

2072
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,160
try to show you a proof uh at the end of
 

2073
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,870
try to show you a proof uh at the end of
class of why this actually happens um

2074
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:30,880
class of why this actually happens um
 

2075
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,109
class of why this actually happens um
for the least squares case and we'll or

2076
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:33,119
for the least squares case and we'll or
 

2077
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,470
for the least squares case and we'll or
not the least squares case but really

2078
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:34,480
not the least squares case but really
 

2079
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,630
not the least squares case but really
the um underdetermined um case of having

2080
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:38,640
the um underdetermined um case of having
 

2081
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,069
the um underdetermined um case of having
a linear system that you're trying to

2082
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
a linear system that you're trying to
 

2083
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,550
a linear system that you're trying to
fit

2084
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:42,560
fit
 

2085
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,309
fit
questions here. We're good.

2086
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:46,319
questions here. We're good.
 

2087
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,230
questions here. We're good.
So for example, this is a really nice

2088
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:48,240
So for example, this is a really nice
 

2089
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,510
So for example, this is a really nice
picture from the prince book. So what

2090
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
picture from the prince book. So what
 

2091
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,990
picture from the prince book. So what
you're seeing here is a lost landscape.

2092
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:54,000
you're seeing here is a lost landscape.
 

2093
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,950
you're seeing here is a lost landscape.
The valleys are the dark colors. The

2094
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:56,960
The valleys are the dark colors. The
 

2095
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,309
The valleys are the dark colors. The
peaks are kind of these lighter colors.

2096
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:00,319
peaks are kind of these lighter colors.
 

2097
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:01,910
peaks are kind of these lighter colors.
And what you see is you have three

2098
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:01,920
And what you see is you have three
 

2099
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,829
And what you see is you have three
different initialization points. One,

2100
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:03,839
different initialization points. One,
 

2101
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,829
different initialization points. One,
two, and three.

2102
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:05,839
two, and three.
 

2103
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,069
two, and three.
And when you do gradient descent, well,

2104
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:08,079
And when you do gradient descent, well,
 

2105
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:09,670
And when you do gradient descent, well,
you know, you initialize at one and it

2106
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
you know, you initialize at one and it
 

2107
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,190
you know, you initialize at one and it
kind of finds its way to the right

2108
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,200
kind of finds its way to the right
 

2109
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,109
kind of finds its way to the right
minimum. When you initialize at three,

2110
00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:13,119
minimum. When you initialize at three,
 

2111
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,030
minimum. When you initialize at three,
it finds its way to the right minimum.

2112
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,040
it finds its way to the right minimum.
 

2113
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,230
it finds its way to the right minimum.
But two kind of takes a different path

2114
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
But two kind of takes a different path
 

2115
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,030
But two kind of takes a different path
and doesn't really get you to the

2116
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,040
and doesn't really get you to the
 

2117
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,750
and doesn't really get you to the
minimum the the global minimum it takes

2118
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760
minimum the the global minimum it takes
 

2119
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,270
minimum the the global minimum it takes
you to a different local minimum and it

2120
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:25,280
you to a different local minimum and it
 

2121
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,950
you to a different local minimum and it
kind of gets stuck there. Does everyone

2122
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:26,960
kind of gets stuck there. Does everyone
 

2123
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,910
kind of gets stuck there. Does everyone
see that from this uh picture?

2124
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:29,920
see that from this uh picture?
 

2125
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,750
see that from this uh picture?
Stoastic gradient descent on the other

2126
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:31,760
Stoastic gradient descent on the other
 

2127
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,870
Stoastic gradient descent on the other
hand because it's not taking the optimal

2128
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:34,880
hand because it's not taking the optimal
 

2129
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,870
hand because it's not taking the optimal
gradient step in every time point

2130
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:36,880
gradient step in every time point
 

2131
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,630
gradient step in every time point
instead of kind of going off in this

2132
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
instead of kind of going off in this
 

2133
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,910
instead of kind of going off in this
direction which is where the optimal

2134
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:39,920
direction which is where the optimal
 

2135
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,349
direction which is where the optimal
gradient would have pointed you. It

2136
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:41,359
gradient would have pointed you. It
 

2137
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,790
gradient would have pointed you. It
happens to have a batch where the

2138
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:42,800
happens to have a batch where the
 

2139
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,190
happens to have a batch where the
gradient kind of points this direction

2140
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:45,200
gradient kind of points this direction
 

2141
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,430
gradient kind of points this direction
and it allows it to escape falling into

2142
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:47,440
and it allows it to escape falling into
 

2143
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,109
and it allows it to escape falling into
that local minimum over there and

2144
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:49,119
that local minimum over there and
 

2145
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,910
that local minimum over there and
actually converge to um a better

2157
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,829
entirely possible that it will do bad

2158
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:07,839
things. there's no guarantee um except
 

2159
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,510
things. there's no guarantee um except
that we will actually show that in some

that we will actually show that in some
 

2161
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,109
that we will actually show that in some
cases you can provably show that

00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:11,119
cases you can provably show that
 

2163
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,230
cases you can provably show that
gradient descent uh will converge to the

2164
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,240
gradient descent uh will converge to the
 

2165
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,990
gradient descent uh will converge to the
right optimum

right optimum
 

2167
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,589
right optimum
but there's there's no guarantees on

2168
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:17,599
but there's there's no guarantees on
 

2169
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,950
but there's there's no guarantees on
this right especially in these

00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:18,960
this right especially in these
 

2171
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,750
this right especially in these
complicated non-convex spaces it it it

2172
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:21,760
complicated non-convex spaces it it it
 

2173
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,670
complicated non-convex spaces it it it
could go to the bad place but the thing

2174
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:23,680
could go to the bad place but the thing
 

2175
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,750
could go to the bad place but the thing
that kind of gives you hope is that you

2176
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:25,760
that kind of gives you hope is that you
 

2177
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,150
that kind of gives you hope is that you
know on average it's doing the the right

2178
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:28,160
know on average it's doing the the right
 

2179
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,710
know on average it's doing the the right
thing um and there's many many different

2180
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:30,720
thing um and there's many many different
 

2181
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,150
thing um and there's many many different
components to the gradient there's many

2182
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:32,160
components to the gradient there's many
 

2183
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,990
components to the gradient there's many
different batches you get lots and lots

2184
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,000
different batches you get lots and lots
 

2185
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,430
different batches you get lots and lots
of tries at this

2186
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:37,440
of tries at this
 

2187
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,710
of tries at this
questions.

2188
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:40,720

 

2189
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,710

Okay, so that's really what I want to

2190
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:42,720
Okay, so that's really what I want to
 

2191
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,870
Okay, so that's really what I want to
say about SGD. I want to get to one more

2192
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:44,880
say about SGD. I want to get to one more
 

2193
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,549
say about SGD. I want to get to one more
thing and then if we have time at the

2194
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:46,559
thing and then if we have time at the
 

2195
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,390
thing and then if we have time at the
end, I'm going to try and walk you

2196
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:48,400
end, I'm going to try and walk you
 

2197
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,190
end, I'm going to try and walk you
through a proof of convergence of uh

2198
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:51,200
through a proof of convergence of uh
 

2199
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,349
through a proof of convergence of uh
stoastic gradient descent which will try

2200
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:53,359
stoastic gradient descent which will try
 

2201
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,109
stoastic gradient descent which will try
to which will kind of bring out more

2202
00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:55,119
to which will kind of bring out more
 

2203
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:03,510
to which will kind of bring out more
properties of SG as we go through it.

2204
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:03,520

 

2205
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,190

But

2206
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,200
But
 

2207
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,109
But
SGD or gradient descent, both of these

2208
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:09,119
SGD or gradient descent, both of these
 

2209
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,270
SGD or gradient descent, both of these
are still, you know, they're they're

2210
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:11,280
are still, you know, they're they're
 

2211
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,670
are still, you know, they're they're
great algorithms, but we always want to

2212
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:13,680
great algorithms, but we always want to
 

2213
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,430
great algorithms, but we always want to
be able to do better. And the one thing

2214
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:17,440
be able to do better. And the one thing
 

2215
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,109
be able to do better. And the one thing
that we can do to do better, there's

2216
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:19,119
that we can do to do better, there's
 

2217
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,150
that we can do to do better, there's
many things, and we're going to talk

2218
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:20,160
many things, and we're going to talk
 

2219
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,069
many things, and we're going to talk
about momentum today. We will talk about

2220
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:22,079
about momentum today. We will talk about
 

2221
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,270
about momentum today. We will talk about
Adam in the next class

2222
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:25,280
Adam in the next class
 

2223
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,470
Adam in the next class
as sequential or as as a series of

2224
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:28,480
as sequential or as as a series of
 

2225
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,430
as sequential or as as a series of
improvements that have come to get

2226
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:31,440
improvements that have come to get
 

2227
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,510
improvements that have come to get
gradient descent to be better and better

2228
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:33,520
gradient descent to be better and better
 

2229
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,230
gradient descent to be better and better
and better as an algorithm.

2230
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:38,240

 

2231
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,230

So let's think about gradient descent.

2232
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:40,240
So let's think about gradient descent.
 

2233
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,230
So let's think about gradient descent.
Again, we can just think about this

2234
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:42,240
Again, we can just think about this
 

2235
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,190
Again, we can just think about this
scalar case. Um remember if we look at

2236
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:45,200
scalar case. Um remember if we look at
 

2237
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,109
scalar case. Um remember if we look at
things in the SVD basis, now we just

2238
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119
things in the SVD basis, now we just
 

2239
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,349
things in the SVD basis, now we just
talked about this a bunch. Essentially

2240
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:49,359
talked about this a bunch. Essentially
 

2241
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,270
talked about this a bunch. Essentially
everything just reduces to this scalar

2242
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,280
everything just reduces to this scalar
 

2243
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,549
everything just reduces to this scalar
case. Right? So understanding this

2244
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:52,559
case. Right? So understanding this
 

2245
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,390
case. Right? So understanding this
scalar case is equivalent to thinking

2246
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:54,400
scalar case is equivalent to thinking
 

2247
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,390
scalar case is equivalent to thinking
about a gradient descent in the vector

2248
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:56,400
about a gradient descent in the vector
 

2249
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,390
about a gradient descent in the vector
case but looking at it in the SVD basis

2250
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:00,400
case but looking at it in the SVD basis
 

2251
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,630
case but looking at it in the SVD basis
and we know that basically our step size

2252
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:02,640
and we know that basically our step size
 

2253
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,990
and we know that basically our step size
had better be smaller than uh sigma max

2254
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,000
had better be smaller than uh sigma max
 

2255
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,109
had better be smaller than uh sigma max
squ to be able to get to the minimum

2256
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:11,119
squ to be able to get to the minimum
 

2257
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,990
squ to be able to get to the minimum
uh or to be able to converge at all. So

2258
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,000
uh or to be able to converge at all. So
 

2259
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,150
uh or to be able to converge at all. So
what does this what does this mean? If I

2260
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,160
what does this what does this mean? If I
 

2261
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,270
what does this what does this mean? If I
look at this particular quantity. Okay.

2262
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,280
look at this particular quantity. Okay.
 

2263
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,030
look at this particular quantity. Okay.
So I have a range of different values

2264
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:21,040
So I have a range of different values
 

2265
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,069
So I have a range of different values
for ADA. ADA could be zero or the

2266
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:24,079
for ADA. ADA could be zero or the
 

2267
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,829
for ADA. ADA could be zero or the
largest thing ADA could be is one over

2268
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:25,839
largest thing ADA could be is one over
 

2269
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,750
largest thing ADA could be is one over
sigma squ.

2270
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:27,760
sigma squ.
 

2271
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,589
sigma squ.
So what happens when ADA is zero? What

2272
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:29,599
So what happens when ADA is zero? What
 

2273
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,270
So what happens when ADA is zero? What
is the value of this particular what is

2274
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:31,280
is the value of this particular what is
 

2275
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,150
is the value of this particular what is
this value or what is this like this is

2276
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:34,160
this value or what is this like this is
 

2277
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,109
this value or what is this like this is
the this is this is

2278
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:37,119
the this is this is
 

2279
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:38,870
the this is this is
uh determining the convergence rate of

2280
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:38,880
uh determining the convergence rate of
 

2281
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,870
uh determining the convergence rate of
this recurrence relation. Right? So

2282
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:42,880
this recurrence relation. Right? So
 

2283
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,430
this recurrence relation. Right? So
well when sigma is zero when ada is zero

2284
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
well when sigma is zero when ada is zero
 

2285
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,270
well when sigma is zero when ada is zero
sorry this is just one and when a is is

2286
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:49,280
sorry this is just one and when a is is
 

2287
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,109
sorry this is just one and when a is is
at its largest size well this is

2288
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:51,119
at its largest size well this is
 

2289
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,589
at its largest size well this is
negative one right so I can think about

2290
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:53,599
negative one right so I can think about
 

2291
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,349
negative one right so I can think about
these igen values basically I can think

2292
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:55,359
these igen values basically I can think
 

2293
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,510
these igen values basically I can think
about them as igen values in the complex

2294
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:57,520
about them as igen values in the complex
 

2295
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,069
about them as igen values in the complex
plane but you know we happen to have

2296
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:02,079
plane but you know we happen to have
 

2297
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,030
plane but you know we happen to have
uh no imaginary part for any of these

2298
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
uh no imaginary part for any of these
 

2299
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,470
uh no imaginary part for any of these
for this particular example

2300
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:08,480
for this particular example
 

2301
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,990
for this particular example
if you had imaginary parts you would get

2302
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:10,000
if you had imaginary parts you would get
 

2303
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,510
if you had imaginary parts you would get
oscillations But we're not really going

2304
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520
oscillations But we're not really going
 

2305
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,549
oscillations But we're not really going
to worry about that right now.

2306
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:14,559
to worry about that right now.
 

2307
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,870
to worry about that right now.
And so when I have values, let's say

2308
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:16,880
And so when I have values, let's say
 

2309
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,109
And so when I have values, let's say
that are, you know, over here between 0

2310
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:19,119
that are, you know, over here between 0
 

2311
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,670
that are, you know, over here between 0
and one, I have these positive but

2312
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:21,680
and one, I have these positive but
 

2313
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,750
and one, I have these positive but
convergent igen values, I'm going to get

2314
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:23,760
convergent igen values, I'm going to get
 

2315
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,790
convergent igen values, I'm going to get
this kind of exponential decay, right,

2316
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:26,800
this kind of exponential decay, right,
 

2317
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,510
this kind of exponential decay, right,
of my error, and it's just going to go

2318
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:29,520
of my error, and it's just going to go
 

2319
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,390
of my error, and it's just going to go
uh exponentially to zero.

2320
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:34,400

 

2321
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,390

On the other hand, kind of as ADA

2322
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:36,400
On the other hand, kind of as ADA
 

2323
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,270
On the other hand, kind of as ADA
increases and I'm moving over closer and

2324
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:39,280
increases and I'm moving over closer and
 

2325
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,990
increases and I'm moving over closer and
closer to here, as I get closer and

2326
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,000
closer to here, as I get closer and
 

2327
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,349
closer to here, as I get closer and
closer to zero, what's going to happen

2328
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:43,359
closer to zero, what's going to happen
 

2329
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,190
closer to zero, what's going to happen
to the shape of this exponential? I'm

2330
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:45,200
to the shape of this exponential? I'm
 

2331
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,870
to the shape of this exponential? I'm
going to start decreasing faster and

2332
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:46,880
going to start decreasing faster and
 

2333
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,069
going to start decreasing faster and
faster, right? As I get closer to zero,

2334
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:50,079
faster, right? As I get closer to zero,
 

2335
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,309
faster, right? As I get closer to zero,
but then what happens as soon as I kind

2336
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:52,319
but then what happens as soon as I kind
 

2337
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,430
but then what happens as soon as I kind
of flip to the other side of zero,

2338
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:55,440
of flip to the other side of zero,
 

2339
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,470
of flip to the other side of zero,
I'm going to start seeing some

2340
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:56,480
I'm going to start seeing some
 

2341
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,309
I'm going to start seeing some
oscillations now because I'm multiplying

2342
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:58,319
oscillations now because I'm multiplying
 

2343
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,030
oscillations now because I'm multiplying
by a minus one every time, right? So I'm

2344
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:01,040
by a minus one every time, right? So I'm
 

2345
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,030
by a minus one every time, right? So I'm
still going to converge, but I'm going

2346
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,040
still going to converge, but I'm going
 

2347
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,190
still going to converge, but I'm going
to start doing things like bouncing

2348
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:05,200
to start doing things like bouncing
 

2349
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,630
to start doing things like bouncing
around to converge. I'm going to start

2350
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:06,640
around to converge. I'm going to start
 

2351
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,069
around to converge. I'm going to start
my error convergence is going to start

2352
00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:08,079
my error convergence is going to start
 

2353
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,230
my error convergence is going to start
looking like this.

2354
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:10,240
looking like this.
 

2355
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,990
looking like this.
And eventually these oscillations will

2356
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:12,000
And eventually these oscillations will
 

2357
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,230
And eventually these oscillations will
kind of get bigger and bigger and bigger

2358
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:14,240
kind of get bigger and bigger and bigger
 

2359
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,589
kind of get bigger and bigger and bigger
and then I'll stop being able to

2360
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:15,599
and then I'll stop being able to
 

2361
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,109
and then I'll stop being able to
converge. That oscillation will force me

2362
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:17,119
converge. That oscillation will force me
 

2363
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,109
converge. That oscillation will force me
to diverge as I cross this minus one

2364
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:19,119
to diverge as I cross this minus one
 

2365
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,630
to diverge as I cross this minus one
boundary.

2366
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:20,640
boundary.
 

2367
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,870
boundary.
Does this does this make sense of what

2368
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:22,880
Does this does this make sense of what
 

2369
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,990
Does this does this make sense of what
we're we're doing? Okay.

2370
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000

 

2371
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,750

So what's going to happen is that

2372
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:29,760
So what's going to happen is that
 

2373
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,390
So what's going to happen is that
basically this max singular value is

2374
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:32,400
basically this max singular value is
 

2375
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,309
basically this max singular value is
going to dictate

2376
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:36,319

 

2377
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,069

the learning rate I can choose right I

2378
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079
the learning rate I can choose right I
 

2379
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,069
the learning rate I can choose right I
have a learning rate and it's always the

2380
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:40,079
have a learning rate and it's always the
 

2381
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,750
have a learning rate and it's always the
same for every direction doesn't I'm not

2382
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:43,760
same for every direction doesn't I'm not
 

2383
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,750
same for every direction doesn't I'm not
be able to pick we might we'll we'll

2384
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:45,760
be able to pick we might we'll we'll
 

2385
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,829
be able to pick we might we'll we'll
talk about this later but one of the key

2386
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:47,839
talk about this later but one of the key
 

2387
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,829
talk about this later but one of the key
challenges here is that we cannot our

2388
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
challenges here is that we cannot our
 

2389
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,430
challenges here is that we cannot our
algorithm does not allow us to pick a

2390
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:53,440
algorithm does not allow us to pick a
 

2391
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,630
algorithm does not allow us to pick a
different ADA for every different

2392
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:54,640
different ADA for every different
 

2393
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,270
different ADA for every different
direction.

2394
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:57,280
direction.
 

2395
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,990
direction.
So I can choose a good ADA that will

2396
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
So I can choose a good ADA that will
 

2397
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,309
So I can choose a good ADA that will
allow me to converge reasonably fast in

2398
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:02,319
allow me to converge reasonably fast in
 

2399
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,109
allow me to converge reasonably fast in
my largest singular value.

2400
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,119
my largest singular value.
 

2401
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,990
my largest singular value.
But that could still mean a lot slower

2402
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:08,000
But that could still mean a lot slower
 

2403
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,549
But that could still mean a lot slower
convergence for other directions that

2404
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:10,559
convergence for other directions that
 

2405
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,309
convergence for other directions that
have smaller singular values. Right?

2406
00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:12,319
have smaller singular values. Right?
 

2407
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,230
have smaller singular values. Right?
These might these might not be tiny

2408
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:14,240
These might these might not be tiny
 

2409
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,750
These might these might not be tiny
singular values in which I don't want to

2410
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:15,760
singular values in which I don't want to
 

2411
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,950
singular values in which I don't want to
move and I don't care about. They might

2412
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:16,960
move and I don't care about. They might
 

2413
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,549
move and I don't care about. They might
be like medium singular values but I

2414
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:18,559
be like medium singular values but I
 

2415
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,230
be like medium singular values but I
still might converge slowly in them

2416
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:20,240
still might converge slowly in them
 

2417
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,990
still might converge slowly in them
because my ADA is picked based on my

2418
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,000
because my ADA is picked based on my
 

2419
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,990
because my ADA is picked based on my
maximum one.

2420
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,000
maximum one.
 

2421
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,589
maximum one.
Okay.

2422
00:54:25,589 --> 00:54:25,599
Okay.
 

2423
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,309
Okay.
So can we basically do something to to

2424
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:28,319
So can we basically do something to to
 

2425
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,670
So can we basically do something to to
sm to improve our conversions? Can we

2426
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:31,680
sm to improve our conversions? Can we
 

2427
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,510
sm to improve our conversions? Can we
somehow smooth out some of these

2428
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:33,520
somehow smooth out some of these
 

2429
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,190
somehow smooth out some of these
oscillations? Right? We might like if we

2430
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,200
oscillations? Right? We might like if we
 

2431
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,069
oscillations? Right? We might like if we
want to keep making ADA bigger.

2432
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:38,079
want to keep making ADA bigger.
 

2433
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,069
want to keep making ADA bigger.
Oscillations are bad, but can we smooth

2434
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:40,079
Oscillations are bad, but can we smooth
 

2435
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,309
Oscillations are bad, but can we smooth
them out? Is there something we can do

2436
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:42,319
them out? Is there something we can do
 

2437
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:45,670
them out? Is there something we can do
to improve our convergence rate while

2438
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:45,680
to improve our convergence rate while
 

2439
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,390
to improve our convergence rate while
not oscillating too much? Okay, is

2440
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:48,400
not oscillating too much? Okay, is
 

2441
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,390
not oscillating too much? Okay, is
that's the problem that we want to try

2442
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:50,400
that's the problem that we want to try
 

2443
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,430
that's the problem that we want to try
and tackle. Okay. And that is the

2444
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:53,440
and tackle. Okay. And that is the
 

2445
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,349
and tackle. Okay. And that is the
problem that momentum is trying to

2446
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:55,359
problem that momentum is trying to
 

2447
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,510
problem that momentum is trying to
solve. Is everyone with me on what the

2448
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,520
solve. Is everyone with me on what the
 

2449
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,510
solve. Is everyone with me on what the
problem is?

2450
00:54:59,510 --> 00:54:59,520
problem is?
 

2451
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,950
problem is?
That we have different singular values

2452
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:00,960
That we have different singular values
 

2453
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,190
That we have different singular values
and we want to kind of not just focus on

2454
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:03,200
and we want to kind of not just focus on
 

2455
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,190
and we want to kind of not just focus on
the largest one. We want to be somewhat

2456
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,200
the largest one. We want to be somewhat
 

2457
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,990
the largest one. We want to be somewhat
uh equitable.

2458
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:08,000
uh equitable.
 

2459
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,950
uh equitable.
So when you have oscillations,

2460
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,960
So when you have oscillations,
 

2461
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,390
So when you have oscillations,
what's the way of smoothing out

2462
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:12,400
what's the way of smoothing out
 

2463
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,670
what's the way of smoothing out
oscillations? Like what's your

2464
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:13,680
oscillations? Like what's your
 

2465
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,950
oscillations? Like what's your
intuition? What have you seen before?

2466
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960

 

2467
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,790

decrease magnitude.

2468
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:20,800
decrease magnitude.
 

2469
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,790
decrease magnitude.
>> Decrease magnitude of what?

2470
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:22,800
>> Decrease magnitude of what?
 

2471
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,790
>> Decrease magnitude of what?
>> The mountain you're jumping by.

2472
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:24,800
>> The mountain you're jumping by.
 

2473
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,630
>> The mountain you're jumping by.
>> That's dictated by ADA, right? We can't

2474
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
>> That's dictated by ADA, right? We can't
 

2475
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,870
>> That's dictated by ADA, right? We can't
actually decrease the magnitude on one

2476
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
actually decrease the magnitude on one
 

2477
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,870
actually decrease the magnitude on one
singular value without affecting the

2478
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
singular value without affecting the
 

2479
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,430
singular value without affecting the
other singular values.

2480
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:33,440
other singular values.
 

2481
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,790
other singular values.
So yeah,

2482
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:34,800
So yeah,
 

2483
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,829
So yeah,
>> moving average.

2484
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:35,839
>> moving average.
 

2485
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,349
>> moving average.
>> Keep a moving average, right? That's a

2486
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:37,359
>> Keep a moving average, right? That's a
 

2487
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,109
>> Keep a moving average, right? That's a
way of

2488
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:39,119
way of
 

2489
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,910
way of
same idea. Yeah. Okay. So keep a moving

2490
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:41,920
same idea. Yeah. Okay. So keep a moving
 

2491
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,589
same idea. Yeah. Okay. So keep a moving
average, right? The idea is to say that

2492
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:43,599
average, right? The idea is to say that
 

2493
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,150
average, right? The idea is to say that
if you're bouncing around a lot, well,

2494
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:46,160
if you're bouncing around a lot, well,
 

2495
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,190
if you're bouncing around a lot, well,
don't bounce so much. And if you keep

2496
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:49,200
don't bounce so much. And if you keep
 

2497
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,630
don't bounce so much. And if you keep
averaging yourself, you're going up and

2498
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:50,640
averaging yourself, you're going up and
 

2499
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,390
averaging yourself, you're going up and
down and up and down. If you average,

2500
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:52,400
down and up and down. If you average,
 

2501
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,910
down and up and down. If you average,
you're going to kind of zero out

2502
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:53,920
you're going to kind of zero out
 

2503
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,390
you're going to kind of zero out
yourself. And then you might oscillate

2504
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:56,400
yourself. And then you might oscillate
 

2505
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,109
yourself. And then you might oscillate
less. Okay?

2506
00:55:59,109 --> 00:55:59,119
less. Okay?
 

2507
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,030
less. Okay?
So then the question comes, well, how

2508
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:01,040
So then the question comes, well, how
 

2509
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,430
So then the question comes, well, how
much do I average? Right? Do I average

2510
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:03,440
much do I average? Right? Do I average
 

2511
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,030
much do I average? Right? Do I average
the past two steps, the past three

2512
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,040
the past two steps, the past three
 

2513
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,789
the past two steps, the past three
steps, the past five steps? How do I

2514
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:06,799
steps, the past five steps? How do I
 

2515
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,190
steps, the past five steps? How do I
think about this average?

2516
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,200
think about this average?
 

2517
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,589
think about this average?
The thing about deep learning and just

2518
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:11,599
The thing about deep learning and just
 

2519
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,270
The thing about deep learning and just
learning algorithms in general is that

2520
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:13,280
learning algorithms in general is that
 

2521
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,069
learning algorithms in general is that
you're not like you want to also be able

2522
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:16,079
you're not like you want to also be able
 

2523
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,510
you're not like you want to also be able
to implement these algorithms. And so

2524
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:19,520
to implement these algorithms. And so
 

2525
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,030
to implement these algorithms. And so
when I think about taking an average,

2526
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,040
when I think about taking an average,
 

2527
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,030
when I think about taking an average,
that is my standard intuition for

2528
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:23,040
that is my standard intuition for
 

2529
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,109
that is my standard intuition for
reducing oscillations. But let's say I

2530
00:56:25,109 --> 00:56:25,119
reducing oscillations. But let's say I
 

2531
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,789
reducing oscillations. But let's say I
want to do a moving average window of

2532
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:26,799
want to do a moving average window of
 

2533
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,470
want to do a moving average window of
10. That means I have to remember the

2534
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:28,480
10. That means I have to remember the
 

2535
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,789
10. That means I have to remember the
gradient of the past 10 points and then

2536
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:30,799
gradient of the past 10 points and then
 

2537
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,789
gradient of the past 10 points and then
average it average them. Maybe I want to

2538
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:32,799
average it average them. Maybe I want to
 

2539
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,069
average it average them. Maybe I want to
do a larger window. You know, I don't

2540
00:56:34,069 --> 00:56:34,079
do a larger window. You know, I don't
 

2541
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,109
do a larger window. You know, I don't
know. This is again one more

2542
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:35,119
know. This is again one more
 

2543
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,390
know. This is again one more
hyperparameter that has now been

2544
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:36,400
hyperparameter that has now been
 

2545
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,470
hyperparameter that has now been
introduced that I have to tune. What is

2546
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:38,480
introduced that I have to tune. What is
 

2547
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,150
introduced that I have to tune. What is
the right amount of averaging? Okay,

2548
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160
the right amount of averaging? Okay,
 

2549
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,910
the right amount of averaging? Okay,
but what is another way that we know to

2550
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:45,920
but what is another way that we know to
 

2551
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,549
but what is another way that we know to
do averaging or for those of you who

2552
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:48,559
do averaging or for those of you who
 

2553
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,069
do averaging or for those of you who
have heard have you ever has anyone

2554
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:50,079
have heard have you ever has anyone
 

2555
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,710
have heard have you ever has anyone
heard the term low pass filter? Yeah. So

2556
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:52,720
heard the term low pass filter? Yeah. So
 

2557
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,109
heard the term low pass filter? Yeah. So
the EES in the room definitely have 16A

2558
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:55,119
the EES in the room definitely have 16A
 

2559
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,069
the EES in the room definitely have 16A
have definitely heard uh uh what a low

2560
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:58,079
have definitely heard uh uh what a low
 

2561
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,870
have definitely heard uh uh what a low
pass filter is. So a low pass filter is

2562
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:00,880
pass filter is. So a low pass filter is
 

2563
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,470
pass filter is. So a low pass filter is
something that's saying take my high

2564
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:02,480
something that's saying take my high
 

2565
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,789
something that's saying take my high
frequency oscillations and smooth them

2566
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:04,799
frequency oscillations and smooth them
 

2567
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,430
frequency oscillations and smooth them
out, right? don't have high frequencies

2568
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:07,440
out, right? don't have high frequencies
 

2569
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,069
out, right? don't have high frequencies
in my signal. Keep only the low low pass

2570
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:10,079
in my signal. Keep only the low low pass
 

2571
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,510
in my signal. Keep only the low low pass
the low frequencies. Right? Big

2572
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:11,520
the low frequencies. Right? Big
 

2573
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,230
the low frequencies. Right? Big
oscillations are high frequencies.

2574
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:14,240
oscillations are high frequencies.
 

2575
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,990
oscillations are high frequencies.
A low pass filter is basically an

2576
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,000
A low pass filter is basically an
 

2577
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,030
A low pass filter is basically an
average averaging mechanism. And we have

2578
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,040
average averaging mechanism. And we have
 

2579
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,670
average averaging mechanism. And we have
these in nature everywhere, right? And

2580
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:21,680
these in nature everywhere, right? And
 

2581
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,910
these in nature everywhere, right? And
these are often coming when we have a a

2582
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:23,920
these are often coming when we have a a
 

2583
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,030
these are often coming when we have a a
kind of state in our system.

2584
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:27,040
kind of state in our system.
 

2585
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,990
kind of state in our system.
So one example of this just comes from

2586
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,000
So one example of this just comes from
 

2587
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,470
So one example of this just comes from
circuits straight up circuits. So for

2588
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:32,480
circuits straight up circuits. So for
 

2589
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,630
circuits straight up circuits. So for
example if I have this is a standard low

2590
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:34,640
example if I have this is a standard low
 

2591
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,750
example if I have this is a standard low
RC lowass filter what do I have is I

2592
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:37,760
RC lowass filter what do I have is I
 

2593
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,910
RC lowass filter what do I have is I
have just this uh resistance and as VIN

2594
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:41,920
have just this uh resistance and as VIN
 

2595
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,390
have just this uh resistance and as VIN
changes my V out is going to change but

2596
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:44,400
changes my V out is going to change but
 

2597
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,750
changes my V out is going to change but
what this capacitor is going to do is is

2598
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:47,760
what this capacitor is going to do is is
 

2599
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,750
what this capacitor is going to do is is
going to dampen my change right so for

2600
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:49,760
going to dampen my change right so for
 

2601
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,870
going to dampen my change right so for
example if this um if my VN is pretty

2602
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:54,880
example if this um if my VN is pretty
 

2603
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,630
example if this um if my VN is pretty
constant right if my VN is pretty

2604
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:56,640
constant right if my VN is pretty
 

2605
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,150
constant right if my VN is pretty
constant what's going to happen is my

2606
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,160
constant what's going to happen is my
 

2607
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,630
constant what's going to happen is my
capacitor is just going to saturate no

2608
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:00,640
capacitor is just going to saturate no
 

2609
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,069
capacitor is just going to saturate no
current is going to flow this Okay. And

2610
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:02,079
current is going to flow this Okay. And
 

2611
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,750
current is going to flow this Okay. And
then VN is just going to be equal to V

2612
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:03,760
then VN is just going to be equal to V
 

2613
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,069
then VN is just going to be equal to V
out. That's what for a constant input.

2614
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:06,079
out. That's what for a constant input.
 

2615
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,870
out. That's what for a constant input.
But now if my VN is like going up and

2616
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:08,880
But now if my VN is like going up and
 

2617
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,150
But now if my VN is like going up and
down and up and down, what's going to

2618
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:10,160
down and up and down, what's going to
 

2619
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,670
down and up and down, what's going to
happen is I'm going to charge discharge

2620
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:11,680
happen is I'm going to charge discharge
 

2621
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,349
happen is I'm going to charge discharge
charge discharge charge discharge my

2622
00:58:13,349 --> 00:58:13,359
charge discharge charge discharge my
 

2623
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,750
charge discharge charge discharge my
capacitor and it's going to eat up some

2624
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:15,760
capacitor and it's going to eat up some
 

2625
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,829
capacitor and it's going to eat up some
of that charge. What's going to come out

2626
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:17,839
of that charge. What's going to come out
 

2627
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,069
of that charge. What's going to come out
at V out is going to be a smooth

2628
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:20,079
at V out is going to be a smooth
 

2629
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,589
at V out is going to be a smooth
version, a much smooth version. It's

2630
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:21,599
version, a much smooth version. It's
 

2631
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:25,270
version, a much smooth version. It's
going to be an automatic averaging of

2632
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:25,280
going to be an automatic averaging of
 

2633
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,910
going to be an automatic averaging of
what VN is. And the way this is being

2634
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:27,920
what VN is. And the way this is being
 

2635
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,589
what VN is. And the way this is being
done is basically through maintaining

2636
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:29,599
done is basically through maintaining
 

2637
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,190
done is basically through maintaining
state, right? The charge on the

2638
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:31,200
state, right? The charge on the
 

2639
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,270
state, right? The charge on the
capacitor is dictating whether the

2640
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:33,280
capacitor is dictating whether the
 

2641
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,109
capacitor is dictating whether the
capacitor is acting like a short or like

2642
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:35,119
capacitor is acting like a short or like
 

2643
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,589
capacitor is acting like a short or like
an open circuit. And therefore what

2644
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:37,599
an open circuit. And therefore what
 

2645
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,910
an open circuit. And therefore what
we're seeing is

2646
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:39,920
we're seeing is
 

2647
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,030
we're seeing is
that averaged version. The nice thing

2648
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:43,040
that averaged version. The nice thing
 

2649
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,789
that averaged version. The nice thing
about this is this is essentially doing

2650
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:44,799
about this is this is essentially doing
 

2651
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:48,470
about this is this is essentially doing
averaging. But do I need to now what is

2652
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:48,480
averaging. But do I need to now what is
 

2653
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,549
averaging. But do I need to now what is
the memory required to implement this?

2654
00:58:50,549 --> 00:58:50,559
the memory required to implement this?
 

2655
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,309
the memory required to implement this?
Do I need to remember the 10 past

2656
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:52,319
Do I need to remember the 10 past
 

2657
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,030
Do I need to remember the 10 past
values? No. The state is automatically

2658
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,040
values? No. The state is automatically
 

2659
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,870
values? No. The state is automatically
changing. It's the state space model

2660
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:56,880
changing. It's the state space model
 

2661
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,430
changing. It's the state space model
now. And so automatically my memory is

2662
00:58:59,430 --> 00:58:59,440
now. And so automatically my memory is
 

2663
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,390
now. And so automatically my memory is
being captured by this capacitor. I

2664
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:02,400
being captured by this capacitor. I
 

2665
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,069
being captured by this capacitor. I
don't want to take questions about the

2666
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:04,079
don't want to take questions about the
 

2667
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:06,150
don't want to take questions about the
circuits here because I know that people

2668
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:06,160
circuits here because I know that people
 

2669
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,710
circuits here because I know that people
probably have forgotten their circuits.

2670
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:08,720
probably have forgotten their circuits.
 

2671
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,630
probably have forgotten their circuits.
Go remind yourself of this. But

2672
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:10,640
Go remind yourself of this. But
 

2673
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,670
Go remind yourself of this. But
basically this is a straight

2674
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
basically this is a straight
 

2675
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,109
basically this is a straight
differential equation that this is this

2676
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:13,119
differential equation that this is this
 

2677
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,950
differential equation that this is this
is modeling, right? For a step input of

2678
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:14,960
is modeling, right? For a step input of
 

2679
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,349
is modeling, right? For a step input of
V, you have this exponential decay that

2680
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:17,359
V, you have this exponential decay that
 

2681
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,309
V, you have this exponential decay that
you can um you can capture. What I want

2682
00:59:20,309 --> 00:59:20,319
you can um you can capture. What I want
 

2683
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:23,510
you can um you can capture. What I want
you to get is the physics intuition of

2684
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:23,520
you to get is the physics intuition of
 

2685
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,789
you to get is the physics intuition of
this. And you know we talked about in

2686
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:24,799
this. And you know we talked about in
 

2687
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,950
this. And you know we talked about in
the first lecture of how essentially

2688
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:26,960
the first lecture of how essentially
 

2689
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,349
the first lecture of how essentially
there's we're looking at analog

2690
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:29,359
there's we're looking at analog
 

2691
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,109
there's we're looking at analog
circuits. That's what neural networks

2692
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:31,119
circuits. That's what neural networks
 

2693
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,230
circuits. That's what neural networks
are in some sense. And these intuitions

2694
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:34,240
are in some sense. And these intuitions
 

2695
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,910
are in some sense. And these intuitions
help us actually understand a lot of

2696
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:35,920
help us actually understand a lot of
 

2697
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,030
help us actually understand a lot of
what's going on.

2698
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,040
what's going on.
 

2699
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,270
what's going on.
So if we take this and we actually

2700
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:41,280
So if we take this and we actually
 

2701
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,510
So if we take this and we actually
discretise

2702
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:43,520
discretise
 

2703
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,829
discretise
what this is doing,

2704
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:45,839
what this is doing,
 

2705
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,390
what this is doing,
we can think of this in the following

2706
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:48,400
we can think of this in the following
 

2707
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,870
we can think of this in the following
way.

2708
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:52,880

 

2709
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,510

Where is my pointer?

2710
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:55,520
Where is my pointer?
 

2711
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,589
Where is my pointer?
I can think of maintaining a state. So I

2712
00:59:59,589 --> 00:59:59,599
I can think of maintaining a state. So I
 

2713
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,750
I can think of maintaining a state. So I
take think of this zk as my state

2714
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:01,760
take think of this zk as my state
 

2715
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,670
take think of this zk as my state
variable.

2716
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:03,680
variable.
 

2717
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,710
variable.
And I update my zk plus one at every

2718
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:06,720
And I update my zk plus one at every
 

2719
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,910
And I update my zk plus one at every
iteration as some beta time zk. So

2720
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:11,920
iteration as some beta time zk. So
 

2721
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,309
iteration as some beta time zk. So
basically where I was previously or what

2722
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:14,319
basically where I was previously or what
 

2723
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,230
basically where I was previously or what
my previous gradient was plus 1 minus

2724
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:18,240
my previous gradient was plus 1 minus
 

2725
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,030
my previous gradient was plus 1 minus
beta times the new gradient that I have

2726
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:21,040
beta times the new gradient that I have
 

2727
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,030
beta times the new gradient that I have
got in

2728
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:23,040
got in
 

2729
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,030
got in
okay

2730
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,040
okay
 

2731
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,470
okay
so what is happening when I when I do

2732
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:28,480
so what is happening when I when I do
 

2733
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,589
so what is happening when I when I do
this so let's say z is zero and just

2734
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:31,599
this so let's say z is zero and just
 

2735
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,150
this so let's say z is zero and just
take one minute and try to write out use

2736
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:34,160
take one minute and try to write out use
 

2737
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,589
take one minute and try to write out use
this recurrence relation start with z

2738
01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:35,599
this recurrence relation start with z
 

2739
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:36,950
this recurrence relation start with z
not is zero and try to write out what

2740
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:36,960
not is zero and try to write out what
 

2741
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,549
not is zero and try to write out what
how zen not is evolving so that you will

2742
01:00:38,549 --> 01:00:38,559
how zen not is evolving so that you will
 

2743
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,390
how zen not is evolving so that you will
see what is going on so take a minute

2744
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:40,400
see what is going on so take a minute
 

2745
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,150
see what is going on so take a minute
write this out, discuss with your

2746
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:42,160
write this out, discuss with your
 

2747
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,390
write this out, discuss with your
neighbor. You know, the two of you can

2748
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:44,400
neighbor. You know, the two of you can
 

2749
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,069
neighbor. You know, the two of you can
uh do it on one piece of paper to

2750
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:46,079
uh do it on one piece of paper to
 

2751
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,270
uh do it on one piece of paper to
encourage interaction. So,

2752
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:49,280
encourage interaction. So,
 

2753
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,549
encourage interaction. So,
>> I'll give you one minute. I have a

2754
01:00:50,549 --> 01:00:50,559
>> I'll give you one minute. I have a
 

2755
01:00:50,559 --> 01:01:29,109
>> I'll give you one minute. I have a
timer.

2756
01:01:29,109 --> 01:01:29,119

 

2757
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:51,330

Just sit there.

2758
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:51,340

 

2759
01:01:51,340 --> 01:02:00,069

[Music]

2760
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:00,079

 

2761
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:02,710

Okay.

2762
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:02,720
Okay.
 

2763
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,309
Okay.
>> So,

2764
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:04,319
>> So,
 

2765
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,470
>> So,
what's happening here as I run this?

2766
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:06,480
what's happening here as I run this?
 

2767
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:13,430
what's happening here as I run this?
What what does what does Z1 look like?

2768
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440

 

2769
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,630

Right? Everyone got what I got?

2770
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:16,640
Right? Everyone got what I got?
 

2771
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,829
Right? Everyone got what I got?
Basically, I just have, you know, this

2772
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:19,839
Basically, I just have, you know, this
 

2773
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:21,430
Basically, I just have, you know, this
is just zero. So, I just have this one

2774
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:21,440
is just zero. So, I just have this one
 

2775
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,750
is just zero. So, I just have this one
term here.

2776
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:23,760
term here.
 

2777
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,750
term here.
Okay. But then what happens the next

2778
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:25,760
Okay. But then what happens the next
 

2779
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,750
Okay. But then what happens the next
time step? This thing goes and populates

2780
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:29,760
time step? This thing goes and populates
 

2781
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,910
time step? This thing goes and populates
here

2782
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:33,920

 

2783
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,510

and I get a new term here. Now it gets

2784
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:37,520
and I get a new term here. Now it gets
 

2785
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,950
and I get a new term here. Now it gets
multiplied by this beta. So I have a

2786
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:38,960
multiplied by this beta. So I have a
 

2787
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,990
multiplied by this beta. So I have a
beta* 1 minus beta. Then this whole

2788
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:42,000
beta* 1 minus beta. Then this whole
 

2789
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,750
beta* 1 minus beta. Then this whole
thing gets now multiplied again by

2790
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:43,760
thing gets now multiplied again by
 

2791
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,789
thing gets now multiplied again by
another um uh beta term. And so now if I

2792
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:48,799
another um uh beta term. And so now if I
 

2793
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,910
another um uh beta term. And so now if I
look at my state, my Z's, how are they

2794
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:51,920
look at my state, my Z's, how are they
 

2795
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,150
look at my state, my Z's, how are they
evolving? where there's some weight

2796
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:54,160
evolving? where there's some weight
 

2797
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,990
evolving? where there's some weight
times my oldest gradient and then the

2798
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:56,000
times my oldest gradient and then the
 

2799
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,990
times my oldest gradient and then the
slightly larger weight times my middle

2800
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:58,000
slightly larger weight times my middle
 

2801
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,750
slightly larger weight times my middle
gradient and then the largest weight is

2802
01:02:59,750 --> 01:02:59,760
gradient and then the largest weight is
 

2803
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,390
gradient and then the largest weight is
on my most recent gradient. Right? So I

2804
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:02,400
on my most recent gradient. Right? So I
 

2805
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,549
on my most recent gradient. Right? So I
have this exponentially decaying average

2806
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:06,559
have this exponentially decaying average
 

2807
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,510
have this exponentially decaying average
that is saying take my history of

2808
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:09,520
that is saying take my history of
 

2809
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,829
that is saying take my history of
gradients put less weight on the ones

2810
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:11,839
gradients put less weight on the ones
 

2811
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,750
gradients put less weight on the ones
that were really way back when when we

2812
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:13,760
that were really way back when when we
 

2813
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,750
that were really way back when when we
knew nothing. put more weight on the

2814
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:15,760
knew nothing. put more weight on the
 

2815
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,750
knew nothing. put more weight on the
current data

2816
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:17,760
current data
 

2817
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,069
current data
um

2818
01:03:20,069 --> 01:03:20,079
um
 

2819
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,829
um
but use this to keep kind of moving in

2820
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:23,839
but use this to keep kind of moving in
 

2821
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,670
but use this to keep kind of moving in
the direction that you were moving in.

2822
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:25,680
the direction that you were moving in.
 

2823
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,150
the direction that you were moving in.
So if you get some like you know crazy

2824
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:28,160
So if you get some like you know crazy
 

2825
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,069
So if you get some like you know crazy
outlier point what this is saying is

2826
01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:30,079
outlier point what this is saying is
 

2827
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,270
outlier point what this is saying is
that if you were moving in this

2828
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:31,280
that if you were moving in this
 

2829
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,829
that if you were moving in this
direction and this was kind of working

2830
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,839
direction and this was kind of working
 

2831
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,670
direction and this was kind of working
even if you have a huge thing you're

2832
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:35,680
even if you have a huge thing you're
 

2833
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,270
even if you have a huge thing you're
still you're not going to completely

2834
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:37,280
still you're not going to completely
 

2835
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,029
still you're not going to completely
change course and move just in the

2836
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:39,039
change course and move just in the
 

2837
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,870
change course and move just in the
direction of the new gradient but the

2838
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:40,880
direction of the new gradient but the
 

2839
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,470
direction of the new gradient but the
momentum that you were moving in

2840
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:42,480
momentum that you were moving in
 

2841
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,190
momentum that you were moving in
previously is going to keep you moving a

2842
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:45,200
previously is going to keep you moving a
 

2843
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,230
previously is going to keep you moving a
little bit in that direction.

2844
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
little bit in that direction.
 

2845
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,910
little bit in that direction.
Does that does that make sense? That's

2846
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
Does that does that make sense? That's
 

2847
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,670
Does that does that make sense? That's
why this is called momentum. There's

2848
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:51,680
why this is called momentum. There's
 

2849
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,589
why this is called momentum. There's
like a physics analogy that uh people

2850
01:03:53,589 --> 01:03:53,599
like a physics analogy that uh people
 

2851
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,390
like a physics analogy that uh people
are thinking about maybe like a a a ball

2852
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:56,400
are thinking about maybe like a a a ball
 

2853
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,150
are thinking about maybe like a a a ball
rolling.

2854
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:58,160
rolling.
 

2855
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,150
rolling.
The momentum is just like keep doing

2856
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,160
The momentum is just like keep doing
 

2857
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,950
The momentum is just like keep doing
what you were doing. Don't always just

2858
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:02,960
what you were doing. Don't always just
 

2859
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,750
what you were doing. Don't always just
follow the new thing. Okay. It's a good

2860
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:05,760
follow the new thing. Okay. It's a good
 

2861
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,870
follow the new thing. Okay. It's a good
uh strategy for life too to be grounded.

2862
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:08,880
uh strategy for life too to be grounded.
 

2863
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,630
uh strategy for life too to be grounded.
Whatever new trendy thing comes in, you

2864
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:10,640
Whatever new trendy thing comes in, you
 

2865
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,910
Whatever new trendy thing comes in, you
don't have to jump on the boat every

2866
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:11,920
don't have to jump on the boat every
 

2867
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,510
don't have to jump on the boat every
time. Especially for those of you who

2868
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:13,520
time. Especially for those of you who
 

2869
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,950
time. Especially for those of you who
are interested in deep learning. It's

2870
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:14,960
are interested in deep learning. It's
 

2871
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,990
are interested in deep learning. It's
going to be hard. The times are crazy.

2872
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,000
going to be hard. The times are crazy.
 

2873
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,549
going to be hard. The times are crazy.
So finding ways to be grounded is just a

2874
01:04:20,549 --> 01:04:20,559
So finding ways to be grounded is just a
 

2875
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,349
So finding ways to be grounded is just a
good useful life strategy. Little bit of

2876
01:04:23,349 --> 01:04:23,359
good useful life strategy. Little bit of
 

2877
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:27,510
good useful life strategy. Little bit of
uh philosophy in there. Okay.

2878
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:27,520
uh philosophy in there. Okay.
 

2879
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,510
uh philosophy in there. Okay.
So does everyone see what this kind of

2880
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520
So does everyone see what this kind of
 

2881
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,990
So does everyone see what this kind of
momentum term is is trying to do and how

2882
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,000
momentum term is is trying to do and how
 

2883
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,829
momentum term is is trying to do and how
it's actually helping us.

2884
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:35,839
it's actually helping us.
 

2885
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,150
it's actually helping us.
So if I look now at

2886
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:40,160
So if I look now at
 

2887
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,390
So if I look now at
so this is now this is now so this we

2888
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:42,400
so this is now this is now so this we
 

2889
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,829
so this is now this is now so this we
just talked about momentum in the

2890
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:43,839
just talked about momentum in the
 

2891
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,470
just talked about momentum in the
context of gradient descent. But I can

2892
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:46,480
context of gradient descent. But I can
 

2893
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,549
context of gradient descent. But I can
also do momentum with stochastic

2894
01:04:48,549 --> 01:04:48,559
also do momentum with stochastic
 

2895
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:49,750
also do momentum with stochastic
gradient descent. Right? And typically

2896
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:49,760
gradient descent. Right? And typically
 

2897
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,270
gradient descent. Right? And typically
that's what we will be we we do do. And

2898
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:53,280
that's what we will be we we do do. And
 

2899
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,029
that's what we will be we we do do. And
now in stoastic gradient descent, my

2900
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:55,039
now in stoastic gradient descent, my
 

2901
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,270
now in stoastic gradient descent, my
gradients are already noisy. So when I

2902
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:57,280
gradients are already noisy. So when I
 

2903
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,150
gradients are already noisy. So when I
do momentum, I'm just basically getting

2904
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:00,160
do momentum, I'm just basically getting
 

2905
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,349
do momentum, I'm just basically getting
more averaging, right? And so in a in a

2906
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:03,359
more averaging, right? And so in a in a
 

2907
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,430
more averaging, right? And so in a in a
sense it's it's going to be helpful.

2908
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:05,440
sense it's it's going to be helpful.
 

2909
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,589
sense it's it's going to be helpful.
It's going to be better. There is a

2910
01:05:07,589 --> 01:05:07,599
It's going to be better. There is a
 

2911
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,589
It's going to be better. There is a
downside with stoastic gradient descent

2912
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:09,599
downside with stoastic gradient descent
 

2913
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:12,150
downside with stoastic gradient descent
is that I'm averaging, but I'm averaging

2914
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,160
is that I'm averaging, but I'm averaging
 

2915
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,950
is that I'm averaging, but I'm averaging
noisy things. So the noise from my early

2916
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:14,960
noisy things. So the noise from my early
 

2917
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,349
noisy things. So the noise from my early
iterates it might have been really high

2918
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
iterates it might have been really high
 

2919
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:18,470
iterates it might have been really high
and it might have been really big

2920
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:18,480
and it might have been really big
 

2921
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,109
and it might have been really big
because my gradient was large then is

2922
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
because my gradient was large then is
 

2923
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,109
because my gradient was large then is
going to creep in later. So there is

2924
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:23,119
going to creep in later. So there is
 

2925
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,789
going to creep in later. So there is
like this downside in the sense uh of

2926
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:26,799
like this downside in the sense uh of
 

2927
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,549
like this downside in the sense uh of
momentum as well when you're doing it in

2928
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
momentum as well when you're doing it in
 

2929
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,390
momentum as well when you're doing it in
SGD and there's a trade-off always if

2930
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:30,400
SGD and there's a trade-off always if
 

2931
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,230
SGD and there's a trade-off always if
like how big do you make your sliding

2932
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:32,240
like how big do you make your sliding
 

2933
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,789
like how big do you make your sliding
window and effectively the choice of the

2934
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:34,799
window and effectively the choice of the
 

2935
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:37,349
window and effectively the choice of the
beta parameter is what is dictating how

2936
01:05:37,349 --> 01:05:37,359
beta parameter is what is dictating how
 

2937
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:40,069
beta parameter is what is dictating how
big you make your sliding window.

2938
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:40,079
big you make your sliding window.
 

2939
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,349
big you make your sliding window.
Uh does that make sense? uh but momentum

2940
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:43,359
Uh does that make sense? uh but momentum
 

2941
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:45,190
Uh does that make sense? uh but momentum
basically helps with SGD for the very

2942
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:45,200
basically helps with SGD for the very
 

2943
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,950
basically helps with SGD for the very
same reason that it helps with uh

2944
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:46,960
same reason that it helps with uh
 

2945
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,950
same reason that it helps with uh
gradient descent.

2946
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:50,960

 

2947
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,270

And now again this is from uh the prince

2948
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:53,280
And now again this is from uh the prince
 

2949
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,789
And now again this is from uh the prince
book. I think this is a really great

2950
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:54,799
book. I think this is a really great
 

2951
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:57,990
book. I think this is a really great
figure. So what you have here is you

2952
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,000
figure. So what you have here is you
 

2953
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,190
figure. So what you have here is you
have these two different initializations

2954
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,200
have these two different initializations
 

2955
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,190
have these two different initializations
and this is stoastic gradient descent uh

2956
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:05,200
and this is stoastic gradient descent uh
 

2957
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,870
and this is stoastic gradient descent uh
converging to the optimum but it takes

2958
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:06,880
converging to the optimum but it takes
 

2959
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,990
converging to the optimum but it takes
this like really noisy shaky bumpy path.

2960
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,000
this like really noisy shaky bumpy path.
 

2961
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,789
this like really noisy shaky bumpy path.
But what you see when you have SGD with

2962
01:06:12,789 --> 01:06:12,799
But what you see when you have SGD with
 

2963
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,270
But what you see when you have SGD with
momentum is that these paths are kind of

2964
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:15,280
momentum is that these paths are kind of
 

2965
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,789
momentum is that these paths are kind of
much smoother because they're they're

2966
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:16,799
much smoother because they're they're
 

2967
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,069
much smoother because they're they're
not jumping around as much because

2968
01:06:18,069 --> 01:06:18,079
not jumping around as much because
 

2969
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,789
not jumping around as much because
they're low pass filtered, right? The

2970
01:06:20,789 --> 01:06:20,799
they're low pass filtered, right? The
 

2971
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,750
they're low pass filtered, right? The
the spikes have all kind of uh gone down

2972
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:23,760
the spikes have all kind of uh gone down
 

2973
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,270
the spikes have all kind of uh gone down
quite a bit. Okay,

2974
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:27,280
quite a bit. Okay,
 

2975
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,870
quite a bit. Okay,
I've talked a lot. I'll pause for

2976
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:28,880
I've talked a lot. I'll pause for
 

2977
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,670
I've talked a lot. I'll pause for
questions.

2978
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:33,680

 

2979
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,630

>> Yes. So this general like smoothing

2980
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:36,640
>> Yes. So this general like smoothing
 

2981
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,270
>> Yes. So this general like smoothing
effect is the end result of it.

2982
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:39,280
effect is the end result of it.
 

2983
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,950
effect is the end result of it.
Basically you have less iterations to

2984
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:40,960
Basically you have less iterations to
 

2985
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,470
Basically you have less iterations to
get to a minimum.

2986
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,480
get to a minimum.
 

2987
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,390
get to a minimum.
>> Yes. Okay. So what's the bang for the

2988
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400
>> Yes. Okay. So what's the bang for the
 

2989
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,349
>> Yes. Okay. So what's the bang for the
buck?

2990
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:45,359
buck?
 

2991
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:48,150
buck?
>> Um we don't care like you know I could

2992
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:48,160
>> Um we don't care like you know I could
 

2993
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,150
>> Um we don't care like you know I could
have an ugly trajectory you're saying

2994
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:50,160
have an ugly trajectory you're saying
 

2995
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,990
have an ugly trajectory you're saying
but you know I'm not here for the

2996
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:52,000
but you know I'm not here for the
 

2997
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,670
but you know I'm not here for the
visualizations. I'm here for getting to

2998
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:53,680
visualizations. I'm here for getting to
 

2999
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,829
visualizations. I'm here for getting to
the minimum. So what's who cares? Who

3000
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:55,839
the minimum. So what's who cares? Who
 

3001
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,630
the minimum. So what's who cares? Who
cares if my trajectory is is is is

3002
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:58,640
cares if my trajectory is is is is
 

3003
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,430
cares if my trajectory is is is is
smoother or not? So what you can prove

3004
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:01,440
smoother or not? So what you can prove
 

3005
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,349
smoother or not? So what you can prove
you can provably show that actually um

3006
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:05,359
you can provably show that actually um
 

3007
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,029
you can provably show that actually um
this will actually this will this will

3008
01:07:07,029 --> 01:07:07,039
this will actually this will this will
 

3009
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,589
this will actually this will this will
improve convergence and if you remember

3010
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:09,599
improve convergence and if you remember
 

3011
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,510
improve convergence and if you remember
gradient descent kind of has a

3012
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
gradient descent kind of has a
 

3013
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,430
gradient descent kind of has a
convergence rate that depends on the

3014
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:13,440
convergence rate that depends on the
 

3015
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,270
convergence rate that depends on the
condition number. What you will find

3016
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:15,280
condition number. What you will find
 

3017
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,870
condition number. What you will find
with momentum is that your convergence

3018
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:16,880
with momentum is that your convergence
 

3019
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,150
with momentum is that your convergence
rate will actually depend on the square

3020
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:18,160
rate will actually depend on the square
 

3021
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,990
rate will actually depend on the square
root of the condition number. So you

3022
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:20,000
root of the condition number. So you
 

3023
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,789
root of the condition number. So you
will actually drastically improve your

3024
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:22,799
will actually drastically improve your
 

3025
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:24,309
will actually drastically improve your
um

3026
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:24,319
um
 

3027
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,390
um
your convergence rate. So you will get

3028
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:26,400
your convergence rate. So you will get
 

3029
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,390
your convergence rate. So you will get
to the

3030
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
to the
 

3031
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,270
to the
um get to the minimum faster. So you can

3032
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:31,280
um get to the minimum faster. So you can
 

3033
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,549
um get to the minimum faster. So you can
you can actually theoretically prove

3034
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:32,559
you can actually theoretically prove
 

3035
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:34,950
you can actually theoretically prove
guarantees like this when you uh when

3036
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:34,960
guarantees like this when you uh when
 

3037
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,829
guarantees like this when you uh when
you choose the right choice of beta. So

3038
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:37,839
you choose the right choice of beta. So
 

3039
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,430
you choose the right choice of beta. So
again the right choice of the learning

3040
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:39,440
again the right choice of the learning
 

3041
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,029
again the right choice of the learning
rate and the beta parameter matters. So

3042
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:43,039
rate and the beta parameter matters. So
 

3043
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,870
rate and the beta parameter matters. So
the advantage is basically that you can

3044
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:44,880
the advantage is basically that you can
 

3045
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,430
the advantage is basically that you can
converge faster. The downside in the

3046
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,440
converge faster. The downside in the
 

3047
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,710
converge faster. The downside in the
sense is that now you have this beta

3048
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:48,720
sense is that now you have this beta
 

3049
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,789
sense is that now you have this beta
parameter that's one more hyperparameter

3050
01:07:50,789 --> 01:07:50,799
parameter that's one more hyperparameter
 

3051
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,150
parameter that's one more hyperparameter
that you had to figure out and you had

3052
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:52,160
that you had to figure out and you had
 

3053
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,390
that you had to figure out and you had
to figure out the right uh right value

3054
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:54,400
to figure out the right uh right value
 

3055
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,870
to figure out the right uh right value
for it.

3056
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
for it.
 

3057
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,270
for it.
So yes, long story short, you will

3058
01:07:59,270 --> 01:07:59,280
So yes, long story short, you will
 

3059
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,789
So yes, long story short, you will
converge faster. In practice, uh

3060
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:02,799
converge faster. In practice, uh
 

3061
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:05,589
converge faster. In practice, uh
sometimes people find that just momentum

3062
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:05,599
sometimes people find that just momentum
 

3063
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,829
sometimes people find that just momentum
with SGD doesn't improve things that

3064
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:07,839
with SGD doesn't improve things that
 

3065
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:09,109
with SGD doesn't improve things that
much. And that's what leads to things

3066
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:09,119
much. And that's what leads to things
 

3067
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,829
much. And that's what leads to things
like atom and other algorithms that

3068
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:11,839
like atom and other algorithms that
 

3069
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,750
like atom and other algorithms that
we're going to talk about uh in the next

3070
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:13,760
we're going to talk about uh in the next
 

3071
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,910
we're going to talk about uh in the next
class. But theoretically, you have

3072
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:15,920
class. But theoretically, you have
 

3073
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,669
class. But theoretically, you have
guarantees that actually improve its

3074
01:08:17,669 --> 01:08:17,679
guarantees that actually improve its
 

3075
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,590
guarantees that actually improve its
performance and the and it does improve

3076
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:19,600
performance and the and it does improve
 

3077
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,669
performance and the and it does improve
performance basically.

3078
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:21,679
performance basically.
 

3079
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,749
performance basically.

normal moving averages be okay rather

3082
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:25,920
normal moving averages be okay rather
 

3083
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,910
normal moving averages be okay rather
than doing like this exponential decay

3084
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:27,920
than doing like this exponential decay
 

3085
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,870

3091
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,189
moving averages be okay? It would be
okay. I mean no one's preventing you

3092
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:35,199
okay. I mean no one's preventing you
 

3093
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,189
okay. I mean no one's preventing you
from writing your own optimizer and

3094
01:08:37,189 --> 01:08:37,199
from writing your own optimizer and
 

3095
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:39,349
from writing your own optimizer and
running it and it would work. But when

3096
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:39,359
running it and it would work. But when
 

3097
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:41,189
running it and it would work. But when
you do moving averages, you're being

3098
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:41,199
you do moving averages, you're being
 

3099
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:43,269
you do moving averages, you're being
inefficient and you're you're having

3100
01:08:43,269 --> 01:08:43,279
inefficient and you're you're having
 

3101
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,950
inefficient and you're you're having
your uh you're using more compute

3102
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:46,960
your uh you're using more compute
 

3103
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,229
your uh you're using more compute
essentially, right? You're having you're

3104
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:48,239
essentially, right? You're having you're
 

3105
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:50,309
essentially, right? You're having you're
using more memory. You have a certain

3106
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:50,319
using more memory. You have a certain
 

3107
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,070
using more memory. You have a certain
server. It has a certain uh memory and

3108
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:54,080
server. It has a certain uh memory and
 

3109
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,669
server. It has a certain uh memory and
it has a certain uh power, right? And so

3110
01:08:57,669 --> 01:08:57,679
it has a certain uh power, right? And so
 

3111
01:08:57,679 --> 01:08:59,349
it has a certain uh power, right? And so
you want to be smart about how you

3112
01:08:59,349 --> 01:08:59,359
you want to be smart about how you
 

3113
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,829
you want to be smart about how you
allocate it. And so you what is the

3114
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:01,839
allocate it. And so you what is the
 

3115
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,070
allocate it. And so you what is the
advantage of converging faster? Well,

3116
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:04,080
advantage of converging faster? Well,
 

3117
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,149
advantage of converging faster? Well,
that's less money you have to pay

3118
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:06,159
that's less money you have to pay
 

3119
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:07,829
that's less money you have to pay
essentially, right? That's why you want

3120
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:07,839
essentially, right? That's why you want
 

3121
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,470
essentially, right? That's why you want
to get to the optimum faster.

3122
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,480
to get to the optimum faster.
 

3123
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,149
to get to the optimum faster.
So you could do the moving average but

3124
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:12,159
So you could do the moving average but
 

3125
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:16,950
So you could do the moving average but
now you've basically doubled the uh uh

3126
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:16,960
now you've basically doubled the uh uh
 

3127
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,630
now you've basically doubled the uh uh
you know if you want to have a moving

3128
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:18,640
you know if you want to have a moving
 

3129
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,749
you know if you want to have a moving
window average of size 10 then you have

3130
01:09:21,749 --> 01:09:21,759
window average of size 10 then you have
 

3131
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,510
window average of size 10 then you have
10 numbers that you had to remember

3132
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
10 numbers that you had to remember
 

3133
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,910
10 numbers that you had to remember
whereas now when I look at the momentum

3134
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:25,920
whereas now when I look at the momentum
 

3135
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,669
whereas now when I look at the momentum
equations here where did they go right

3136
01:09:29,669 --> 01:09:29,679
equations here where did they go right
 

3137
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:32,390
equations here where did they go right
if I look at the momentum equations here

3138
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:32,400
if I look at the momentum equations here
 

3139
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,630
if I look at the momentum equations here
really I've only doubled my memory

3140
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:34,640
really I've only doubled my memory
 

3141
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,269
really I've only doubled my memory
doubling is still a thing but I'm now

3142
01:09:37,269 --> 01:09:37,279
doubling is still a thing but I'm now
 

3143
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,430
doubling is still a thing but I'm now
just remembering my

3144
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:39,440
just remembering my
 

3145
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,910
just remembering my
uh W's and my Z's and my my Z's are what

3146
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:43,920
uh W's and my Z's and my my Z's are what
 

3147
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,590
uh W's and my Z's and my my Z's are what
is updating. So I replace the gra I'm

3148
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:45,600
is updating. So I replace the gra I'm
 

3149
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,110
is updating. So I replace the gra I'm
replacing the gradient update here. I

3150
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:47,120
replacing the gradient update here. I
 

3151
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,789
replacing the gradient update here. I
forgot to say this but just to be

3152
01:09:48,789 --> 01:09:48,799
forgot to say this but just to be
 

3153
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,309
forgot to say this but just to be
explicit.

3154
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:50,319
explicit.
 

3155
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,110
explicit.
My gradient descent is WK + 1 equal to W

3156
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:53,120
My gradient descent is WK + 1 equal to W
 

3157
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,870
My gradient descent is WK + 1 equal to W
K minus ADA. And here I would have the

3158
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:54,880
K minus ADA. And here I would have the
 

3159
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,189
K minus ADA. And here I would have the
gradient with momentum. Instead of the

3160
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:57,199
gradient with momentum. Instead of the
 

3161
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,870
gradient with momentum. Instead of the
gradient I have this moving average of

3162
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
gradient I have this moving average of
 

3163
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,830
gradient I have this moving average of
gradients that's represented by the ZK.

3164
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:03,840

 

3165
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,590

Make sense?

3166
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:05,600
Make sense?
 

3167
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,310
Make sense?
>> Yes. Also, if you just did a straight

3168
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:08,320
>> Yes. Also, if you just did a straight
 

3169
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,990
>> Yes. Also, if you just did a straight
moving average, would you just keep

3170
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:10,000
moving average, would you just keep
 

3171
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,709
moving average, would you just keep
going in direction? Like, assuming

3172
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:12,719
going in direction? Like, assuming
 

3173
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,470
going in direction? Like, assuming
there's enough of a run, you have so

3174
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:14,480
there's enough of a run, you have so
 

3175
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,950
there's enough of a run, you have so
much momentum just keep rolling over.

3176
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:16,960
much momentum just keep rolling over.
 

3177
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,229
much momentum just keep rolling over.
>> Oh, you're saying that if you did a

3178
01:10:18,229 --> 01:10:18,239
>> Oh, you're saying that if you did a
 

3179
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:20,630
>> Oh, you're saying that if you did a
moving average with no with no decaying

3180
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:20,640
moving average with no with no decaying
 

3181
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,310
moving average with no with no decaying
weight. Yeah, you might end up in this

3182
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:22,320
weight. Yeah, you might end up in this
 

3183
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,590
weight. Yeah, you might end up in this
position where you have like a huge

3184
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:23,600
position where you have like a huge
 

3185
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,350
position where you have like a huge
large gradient at the beginning and you

3186
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:25,360
large gradient at the beginning and you
 

3187
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,110
large gradient at the beginning and you
know, you're subsequent gradients are

3188
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,120
know, you're subsequent gradients are
 

3189
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,149
know, you're subsequent gradients are
decreasing, but you're not even taking

3190
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
decreasing, but you're not even taking
 

3191
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,910
decreasing, but you're not even taking
that into uh into account because you

3192
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:29,920
that into uh into account because you
 

3193
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,189
that into uh into account because you
have a lot of weight on the on the

3194
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:31,199
have a lot of weight on the on the
 

3195
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,709
have a lot of weight on the on the
beginning. So you wouldn't I mean you

3196
01:10:32,709 --> 01:10:32,719
beginning. So you wouldn't I mean you
 

3197
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,390
beginning. So you wouldn't I mean you
wouldn't be taking advantage of the

3198
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:36,400
wouldn't be taking advantage of the
 

3199
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,070
wouldn't be taking advantage of the
currentness of your update if you didn't

3200
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,080
currentness of your update if you didn't
 

3201
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,590
currentness of your update if you didn't
decay your weight. So just a moving

3202
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:39,600
decay your weight. So just a moving
 

3203
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,070
decay your weight. So just a moving
average. But what what would be

3204
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:42,080
average. But what what would be
 

3205
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,229
average. But what what would be
reasonable is to do a moving average of

3206
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:44,239
reasonable is to do a moving average of
 

3207
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,390
reasonable is to do a moving average of
a small window size. So you don't want

3208
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:46,400
a small window size. So you don't want
 

3209
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,590
a small window size. So you don't want
to ever be averaging all of your

3210
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:47,600
to ever be averaging all of your
 

3211
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,110
to ever be averaging all of your
gradients. But something that is

3212
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,120
gradients. But something that is
 

3213
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,390
gradients. But something that is
reasonable is just to say like I'm going

3214
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:50,400
reasonable is just to say like I'm going
 

3215
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,669
reasonable is just to say like I'm going
to average the past five gradients or

3216
01:10:51,669 --> 01:10:51,679
to average the past five gradients or
 

3217
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:53,510
to average the past five gradients or
the past 10 gradients and forget the

3218
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:53,520
the past 10 gradients and forget the
 

3219
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,830
the past 10 gradients and forget the
ones that were 100 time steps ago.

3220
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:57,840

 

3221
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,310

Okay. Good.

3222
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:02,320

 

3223
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,310

Okay, so we have a little bit of time

3224
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,320
Okay, so we have a little bit of time
 

3225
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,070
Okay, so we have a little bit of time
and I'm going to try and now walk you

3226
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:06,080
and I'm going to try and now walk you
 

3227
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,910
and I'm going to try and now walk you
through this proof for uh actually how

3228
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:09,920
through this proof for uh actually how
 

3229
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,630
through this proof for uh actually how
stoastic gradient descent can uh

3230
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:12,640
stoastic gradient descent can uh
 

3231
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,910
stoastic gradient descent can uh
converge.

3232
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:15,920

 

3233
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,430

So what are we trying to do here? We are

3234
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
So what are we trying to do here? We are
 

3235
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,310
So what are we trying to do here? We are
trying to do what we've been doing so

3236
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:22,320
trying to do what we've been doing so
 

3237
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,390
trying to do what we've been doing so
far is take a simple case of SGD and try

far is take a simple case of SGD and try
and understand at the guts level of why

we can rely on our core understanding of
how this should behave in the simple

01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:43,679
how this should behave in the simple
 

3251
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,830
how this should behave in the simple
cases. Right? when you're looking at

3252
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
cases. Right? when you're looking at
 

3253
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,830

debugging these things is a beast
the point of trying to teach you all of

3274
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
the point of trying to teach you all of
 

3275
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,669
the point of trying to teach you all of
this math behind things is to give you

3276
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:13,679
this math behind things is to give you
 

3277
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,910
this math behind things is to give you
the intuition efficient so that you can

3278
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:15,920
the intuition efficient so that you can
 

3279
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,709
the intuition efficient so that you can
look at simple cases and say hey can I

3280
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:20,719
look at simple cases and say hey can I
 

3281
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:23,110
look at simple cases and say hey can I
intuitively understand what this is

3282
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
intuitively understand what this is
 

3283
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,470
intuitively understand what this is
doing in cases where I can reason about

3284
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:26,480
doing in cases where I can reason about
 

3285
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,709
doing in cases where I can reason about
so that I can see what whether whether

3286
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:28,719
so that I can see what whether whether
 

3287
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,630
so that I can see what whether whether
my implementation is correct or not okay

3288
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:30,640
my implementation is correct or not okay
 

3289
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,790
my implementation is correct or not okay
so there's a there's a there's a reason

3290
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:32,800
so there's a there's a there's a reason
 

3291
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,709
so there's a there's a there's a reason
for kind of understanding this at this

01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:34,719
for kind of understanding this at this
 

3293
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:36,550
for kind of understanding this at this
nitty-gritty level even though there's a

3294
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:36,560
nitty-gritty level even though there's a
 

3295
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,470
nitty-gritty level even though there's a
automatic library that you can you know

need to understand this to implement SGD

need to understand this to implement SGD
 

3301
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,750
need to understand this to implement SGD
But you do need to understand this to

3302
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:45,760
But you do need to understand this to
 

3303
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,070
But you do need to understand this to
develop the next algorithm to debug

3304
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:48,080
develop the next algorithm to debug
 

3305

develop the next algorithm to debug
these things in complicated cases.

3306
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:49,600
these things in complicated cases.
 

3307
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,790
these things in complicated cases.
That's what we're trying to teach you.

3308
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:52,800
That's what we're trying to teach you.
 

3309
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,189
That's what we're trying to teach you.
So let's consider a case of SGD where

3310
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:55,199
So let's consider a case of SGD where
 

3311
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:57,270
So let's consider a case of SGD where
you actually can get to zero loss. So

3312
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:57,280
you actually can get to zero loss. So
 

3313
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,950
you actually can get to zero loss. So
I'm thinking of an underdetermined

3314
01:12:58,950 --> 01:12:58,960
I'm thinking of an underdetermined
 

3315
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,590
I'm thinking of an underdetermined
system and maybe I'm trying to get to

3316
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:01,600
system and maybe I'm trying to get to
 

3317
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,550
system and maybe I'm trying to get to
the uh minimum norm solution. So I have

3318
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:04,560
the uh minimum norm solution. So I have
 

3319
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,790
the uh minimum norm solution. So I have
X where um it's a wide matrix.

3320
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:08,800
X where um it's a wide matrix.
 

3321
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,350
X where um it's a wide matrix.
So D is bigger than N. This is this N

3322
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:11,360
So D is bigger than N. This is this N
 

3323
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,270
So D is bigger than N. This is this N
byD matrix that I have here.

3324
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:15,280

 

3325
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,669

And I'm assuming here that I have full

3326
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:17,679
And I'm assuming here that I have full
 

3327
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,310
And I'm assuming here that I have full
row rank. So

3328
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:20,320
row rank. So
 

3329
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,350
row rank. So
uh I can easily do an xxrpose inversion.

3330
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:23,360
uh I can easily do an xxrpose inversion.
 

3331
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,990
uh I can easily do an xxrpose inversion.
Okay. So let war star be the minimum

3332
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:26,000
Okay. So let war star be the minimum
 

3333
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,070
Okay. So let war star be the minimum
norm solution. In this case there's

3334
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,080
norm solution. In this case there's
 

3335
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,910
norm solution. In this case there's
infinitely many solutions because I have

3336
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:29,920
infinitely many solutions because I have
 

3337
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,750
infinitely many solutions because I have
an underdetermined system. Let's pick

3338
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:31,760
an underdetermined system. Let's pick
 

3339
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,669
an underdetermined system. Let's pick
the minimum norm one. We know exactly

3340
01:13:33,669 --> 01:13:33,679
the minimum norm one. We know exactly
 

3341
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,270
the minimum norm one. We know exactly
what it is. It's given by this

3342
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:35,280
what it is. It's given by this
 

3343
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,110
what it is. It's given by this
expression.

3344
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:37,120
expression.
 

3345
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,990
expression.
And now let's say what let's try and

3346
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:40,000
And now let's say what let's try and
 

3347
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,950
And now let's say what let's try and
explore what happens when we do SGD just

3348
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:42,960
explore what happens when we do SGD just
 

3349
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,310
explore what happens when we do SGD just
with batch size one. Okay. So before

3350
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:46,320
with batch size one. Okay. So before
 

3351
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,310
with batch size one. Okay. So before
doing that what I want to just do is I

3352
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:48,320
doing that what I want to just do is I
 

3353
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,310
doing that what I want to just do is I
want to say let's look at the system but

3354
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:52,320
want to say let's look at the system but
 

3355
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,350
want to say let's look at the system but
in a slightly transformed space. So what

3356
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:55,360
in a slightly transformed space. So what
 

3357
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,149
in a slightly transformed space. So what
I'm going to do is I'm going to say

3358
01:13:58,149 --> 01:13:58,159
I'm going to do is I'm going to say
 

3359
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:01,270
I'm going to do is I'm going to say
instead of looking at W which is my

3360
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:01,280
instead of looking at W which is my
 

3361
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,270
instead of looking at W which is my
optimal parameter I want to look at the

3362
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:03,280
optimal parameter I want to look at the
 

3363
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,270
optimal parameter I want to look at the
error of my optimal parameter. So I want

3364
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:05,280
error of my optimal parameter. So I want
 

3365
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:10,310
error of my optimal parameter. So I want
to look at the difference between

3366
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,320

 

3367
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,790

W, which is where I currently am, and W

3368
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:12,800
W, which is where I currently am, and W
 

3369
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,470
W, which is where I currently am, and W
star. Okay. So I'm just going to do a,

3370
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,480
star. Okay. So I'm just going to do a,
 

3371
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,950
star. Okay. So I'm just going to do a,
you know, transformation of coordinates

3372
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:18,960
you know, transformation of coordinates
 

3373
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,750
you know, transformation of coordinates
and instead of looking at W's, I'm going

3374
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:21,760
and instead of looking at W's, I'm going
 

3375
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,070
and instead of looking at W's, I'm going
to look at Q's where Q is the distance

3376
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:24,080
to look at Q's where Q is the distance
 

3377
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,709
to look at Q's where Q is the distance
of where I currently am to W star. Does

3378
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:26,719
of where I currently am to W star. Does
 

3379
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,470
of where I currently am to W star. Does
that make sense to everyone? So instead

3380
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:28,480
that make sense to everyone? So instead
 

3381
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,709
that make sense to everyone? So instead
of writing XW is equal to Y, I'm going

3382
01:14:30,709 --> 01:14:30,719
of writing XW is equal to Y, I'm going
 

3383
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,149
of writing XW is equal to Y, I'm going
to write XQ equal to zero where Q is

3384
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:34,159
to write XQ equal to zero where Q is
 

3385
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:39,669
to write XQ equal to zero where Q is
just my error. No big deal.

3386
01:14:39,669 --> 01:14:39,679

 

3387
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:41,990

So we know from the SVD now that all

3388
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:42,000
So we know from the SVD now that all
 

3389
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,910
So we know from the SVD now that all
that matters really for us is the

3390
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:43,920
that matters really for us is the
 

3391
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,669
that matters really for us is the
directions with the nonzero singular

3392
01:14:45,669 --> 01:14:45,679
directions with the nonzero singular
 

3393
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,350
directions with the nonzero singular
values. Obviously I cannot move in

3394
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:47,360
values. Obviously I cannot move in
 

3395
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,669
values. Obviously I cannot move in
directions where I have no data points

3396
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:49,679
directions where I have no data points
 

3397
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,830
directions where I have no data points
because I can SGD and gradient descent

3398
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:51,840
because I can SGD and gradient descent
 

3399
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,110
because I can SGD and gradient descent
will only move me in the directions of

3400
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:53,120
will only move me in the directions of
 

3401
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,750
will only move me in the directions of
the data points. So you know let's go to

3402
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:55,760
the data points. So you know let's go to
 

3403
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,669
the data points. So you know let's go to
the SVD basis. we have evidence that

3404
01:14:57,669 --> 01:14:57,679
the SVD basis. we have evidence that
 

3405
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:02,390
the SVD basis. we have evidence that
this is a a useful thing to do.

3406
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400

 

3407
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,590

So I can look at my xq and I write it in

3408
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:05,600
So I can look at my xq and I write it in
 

3409
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,630
So I can look at my xq and I write it in
the svd basis. So I have here u sigma

3410
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:08,640
the svd basis. So I have here u sigma
 

3411
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,990
the svd basis. So I have here u sigma
vranspose * q

3412
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:12,000
vranspose * q
 

3413
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,990
vranspose * q
and now sigma is a wide matrix right

3414
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:16,000
and now sigma is a wide matrix right
 

3415
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,390
and now sigma is a wide matrix right
because my x is a wide matrix so it's of

3416
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:18,400
because my x is a wide matrix so it's of
 

3417
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,390
because my x is a wide matrix so it's of
the following form where sigma 1 is this

3418
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400
the following form where sigma 1 is this
 

3419
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,110
the following form where sigma 1 is this
diagonal matrix here and then I have a

3420
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:23,120
diagonal matrix here and then I have a
 

3421
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,110
diagonal matrix here and then I have a
bunch of zeros afterwards right so this

3422
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,120
bunch of zeros afterwards right so this
 

3423
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,990
bunch of zeros afterwards right so this
is a square n byn part and this is an n

3424
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:28,000
is a square n byn part and this is an n
 

3425
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,270
is a square n byn part and this is an n
* d minus n part

3426
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:31,280
* d minus n part
 

3427
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,669
* d minus n part
okay

3428
01:15:33,669 --> 01:15:33,679
okay
 

3429
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,830
okay
and I can just rewrite this therefore as

3430
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:35,840
and I can just rewrite this therefore as
 

3431
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,350
and I can just rewrite this therefore as
kind of These zeros aren't going to

3432
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:37,360
kind of These zeros aren't going to
 

3433
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,870
kind of These zeros aren't going to
matter. So I write this as this X

3434
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:38,880
matter. So I write this as this X
 

3435
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:43,110
matter. So I write this as this X
twiddle time Z where this is now the

3436
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,120
twiddle time Z where this is now the
 

3437
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,910
twiddle time Z where this is now the
part that I care about. X twiddle is

3438
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:45,920
part that I care about. X twiddle is
 

3439
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,669
part that I care about. X twiddle is
just my U sigma 1. Okay.

3440
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:49,679
just my U sigma 1. Okay.
 

3441
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,590
just my U sigma 1. Okay.
So I want to again just try to simplify

3442
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:51,600
So I want to again just try to simplify
 

3443
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,070
So I want to again just try to simplify
my system as much as possible. I'm not

3444
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:54,080
my system as much as possible. I'm not
 

3445
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,070
my system as much as possible. I'm not
going to walk you through this. But if I

3446
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:56,080
going to walk you through this. But if I
 

3447
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:00,870
going to walk you through this. But if I
now was to think about what would my um

3448
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:00,880
now was to think about what would my um
 

3449
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,110
now was to think about what would my um
what would be my uh initial condition

3450
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:03,120
what would be my uh initial condition
 

3451
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,390
what would be my uh initial condition
also in the SVD basis, I can do a

3452
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:06,400
also in the SVD basis, I can do a
 

3453
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,870
also in the SVD basis, I can do a
similar similar algebra to this and see

3454
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:08,880
similar similar algebra to this and see
 

3455
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,590
similar similar algebra to this and see
that my initial condition

3456
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:11,600
that my initial condition
 

3457
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,510
that my initial condition
would end up being kind of like this. I

3458
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
would end up being kind of like this. I
 

3459
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,950
would end up being kind of like this. I
initially started at zero

3460
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:16,960
initially started at zero
 

3461
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,630
initially started at zero
in my new coordinates. My initial

3462
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:18,640
in my new coordinates. My initial
 

3463
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,790
in my new coordinates. My initial
condition became minus war because I was

3464
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:20,800
condition became minus war because I was
 

3465
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,070
condition became minus war because I was
looking at my error.

3466
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:24,080
looking at my error.
 

3467
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,149
looking at my error.
And now don't worry about this, but what

3468
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:26,159
And now don't worry about this, but what
 

3469
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:27,910
And now don't worry about this, but what
I want you to see is that here the last

3470
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:27,920
I want you to see is that here the last
 

3471
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,189
I want you to see is that here the last
d minus n entries are basically zero.

3472
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:31,199
d minus n entries are basically zero.
 

3473
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:34,149
d minus n entries are basically zero.
What that tells us is that all I really

3474
01:16:34,149 --> 01:16:34,159
What that tells us is that all I really
 

3475
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,709
What that tells us is that all I really
need to care about is the evolution of

3476
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:36,719
need to care about is the evolution of
 

3477
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:39,750
need to care about is the evolution of
the system according to this x twiddle

3478
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:39,760
the system according to this x twiddle
 

3479
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,950
the system according to this x twiddle
and this z, right? Because my initial

3480
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:42,960
and this z, right? Because my initial
 

3481
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,229
and this z, right? Because my initial
condition doesn't have anything in the

3482
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:44,239
condition doesn't have anything in the
 

3483
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:47,189
condition doesn't have anything in the
last d minus n coordinates and my state

3484
01:16:47,189 --> 01:16:47,199
last d minus n coordinates and my state
 

3485
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,550
last d minus n coordinates and my state
evolution also doesn't have anything in

3486
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:48,560
evolution also doesn't have anything in
 

3487
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,950
evolution also doesn't have anything in
the last d minus n coordinates. So I can

3488
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:50,960
the last d minus n coordinates. So I can
 

3489
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,110
the last d minus n coordinates. So I can
basically reduce

3490
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:53,120
basically reduce
 

3491
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,669
basically reduce
my attention to looking at this square

3492
01:16:55,669 --> 01:16:55,679
my attention to looking at this square
 

3493
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,790
my attention to looking at this square
system

3494
01:16:58,790 --> 01:16:58,800

 

3495
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,870

x twiddle z equal to zero. Okay. And row

3496
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:02,880
x twiddle z equal to zero. Okay. And row
 

3497
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,110
x twiddle z equal to zero. Okay. And row
by row actually you can show I'm not

3498
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:05,120
by row actually you can show I'm not
 

3499
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,030
by row actually you can show I'm not
going to do it right now but that the

3500
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:07,040
going to do it right now but that the
 

3501
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,110
going to do it right now but that the
irow of this system is basically the

3502
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,120
irow of this system is basically the
 

3503
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:12,229
irow of this system is basically the
irow of your original system. Okay. So

3504
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
irow of your original system. Okay. So
 

3505
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,709
irow of your original system. Okay. So
these are exactly the same things but

3506
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:14,719
these are exactly the same things but
 

3507
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,950
these are exactly the same things but
you're just focusing attention on the

3508
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:16,960
you're just focusing attention on the
 

3509
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,470
you're just focusing attention on the
directions that matter and throwing away

3510
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:18,480
directions that matter and throwing away
 

3511
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,950
directions that matter and throwing away
all the rest.

3512
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:22,960

 

3513
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,910

So how are we going to try and show that

3514
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:25,920
So how are we going to try and show that
 

3515
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,229
So how are we going to try and show that
this thing actually converges? Well, if

3516
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:28,239
this thing actually converges? Well, if
 

3517
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,870
this thing actually converges? Well, if
I was to take a gradient descent step,

3518
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:30,880
I was to take a gradient descent step,
 

3519
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,550
I was to take a gradient descent step,
this would be my loss function. And I

3520
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:32,560
this would be my loss function. And I
 

3521
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,990
this would be my loss function. And I
would get a gradient descent step that

3522
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,000
would get a gradient descent step that
 

3523
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,709
would get a gradient descent step that
looks something like this.

3524
01:17:36,709 --> 01:17:36,719
looks something like this.
 

3525
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,390
looks something like this.
What would be the corresponding

3526
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:38,400
What would be the corresponding
 

3527
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,189
What would be the corresponding
stochastic gradient descent step when I

3528
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:41,199
stochastic gradient descent step when I
 

3529
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:44,149
stochastic gradient descent step when I
have batch size one?

3530
01:17:44,149 --> 01:17:44,159
have batch size one?
 

3531
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,070
have batch size one?
So now until now we haven't really

3532
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:46,080
So now until now we haven't really
 

3533
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,830
So now until now we haven't really
started, we haven't really dealt with

3534
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:47,840
started, we haven't really dealt with
 

3535
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,350
started, we haven't really dealt with
randomness.

3536
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:49,360
randomness.
 

3537
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,110
randomness.
in the discussions that we have talked

3538
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:51,120
in the discussions that we have talked
 

3539
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,669
in the discussions that we have talked
about so far. And now one of the things

3540
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:53,679
about so far. And now one of the things
 

3541
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,430
about so far. And now one of the things
I like about showing you this proof is

3542
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:55,440
I like about showing you this proof is
 

3543
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,590
I like about showing you this proof is
that we have to wrestle with the

3544
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:57,600
that we have to wrestle with the
 

3545
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,550
that we have to wrestle with the
inherent randomness of SGD. When I say

3546
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:00,560
inherent randomness of SGD. When I say
 

3547
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,790
inherent randomness of SGD. When I say
I'm doing SGD with batch size one and

3548
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:02,800
I'm doing SGD with batch size one and
 

3549
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,189
I'm doing SGD with batch size one and
I'm picking iid over my initial data

3550
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:05,199
I'm picking iid over my initial data
 

3551
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,430
I'm picking iid over my initial data
points, do I know which data point I'm

3552
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:07,440
points, do I know which data point I'm
 

3553
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,510
points, do I know which data point I'm
going to get?

3554
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:09,520
going to get?
 

3555
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,790
going to get?
No, I don't know this. Right? So that

3556
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:12,800
No, I don't know this. Right? So that
 

3557
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,030
No, I don't know this. Right? So that
means that when I'm doing SGD, what I'm

3558
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:17,040
means that when I'm doing SGD, what I'm
 

3559
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,189
means that when I'm doing SGD, what I'm
going to have here

3560
01:18:19,189 --> 01:18:19,199
going to have here
 

3561
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,990
going to have here
is instead of this deterministic matrix

3562
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:22,000
is instead of this deterministic matrix
 

3563
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,590
is instead of this deterministic matrix
XRPOSE X, I'm going to have

3564
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:25,600
XRPOSE X, I'm going to have
 

3565
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,510
XRPOSE X, I'm going to have
this matrix that is given by the

3566
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:29,520
this matrix that is given by the
 

3567
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,669
this matrix that is given by the
specific data point I choose and I index

3568
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:31,679
specific data point I choose and I index
 

3569
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:37,350
specific data point I choose and I index
it by this it is the random index that

3570
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:37,360
it by this it is the random index that
 

3571
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,590
it by this it is the random index that
happens to be sampled at that time.

3572
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:39,600
happens to be sampled at that time.
 

3573
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,310
happens to be sampled at that time.
Okay, so this is the SGD update that I

3574
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:42,320
Okay, so this is the SGD update that I
 

3575
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,390
Okay, so this is the SGD update that I
get and we're just doing this for batch

3576
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:44,400
get and we're just doing this for batch
 

3577
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,390
get and we're just doing this for batch
size one.

3578
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:46,400
size one.
 

3579
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,430
size one.
Does that make sense questions? So I'm

3580
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440
Does that make sense questions? So I'm
 

3581
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,030
Does that make sense questions? So I'm
not going to calculate out the SGD

3582
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040
not going to calculate out the SGD
 

3583
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,470
not going to calculate out the SGD
gradient, you know, do this um u

3584
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:54,480
gradient, you know, do this um u
 

3585
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,070
gradient, you know, do this um u
actually it'll be on your homework so

3586
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:56,080
actually it'll be on your homework so
 

3587
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,229
actually it'll be on your homework so
you will have to do it but you can do it

3588
01:18:58,229 --> 01:18:58,239
you will have to do it but you can do it
 

3589
01:18:58,239 --> 01:18:59,669
you will have to do it but you can do it
on your own time. What I'm trying to

3590
01:18:59,669 --> 01:18:59,679
on your own time. What I'm trying to
 

3591
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,669
on your own time. What I'm trying to
give you is a is the big ideas of the

3592
01:19:01,669 --> 01:19:01,679
give you is a is the big ideas of the
 

3593
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,910
give you is a is the big ideas of the
proof. You can check the algebra on your

3594
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:03,920
proof. You can check the algebra on your
 

3595
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,030
proof. You can check the algebra on your
own time.

3596
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:07,040
own time.
 

3597
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,189
own time.
So now what we want to do is we want to

3598
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:09,199
So now what we want to do is we want to
 

3599
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:13,510
So now what we want to do is we want to
say given this SGD update can we argue

3600
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:13,520
say given this SGD update can we argue
 

3601
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,030
say given this SGD update can we argue
that my quadratic loss is actually going

3602
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:17,040
that my quadratic loss is actually going
 

3603
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,830
that my quadratic loss is actually going
to go to zero. I want to look at this

3604
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:19,840
to go to zero. I want to look at this
 

3605
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,750
to go to zero. I want to look at this
loss as it follows the path of evolution

3606
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:23,760
loss as it follows the path of evolution
 

3607
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,709
loss as it follows the path of evolution
dictated by this dynamical system and

3608
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:26,719
dictated by this dynamical system and
 

3609
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,270
dictated by this dynamical system and
say what is happening to this quadratic

3610
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:29,280
say what is happening to this quadratic
 

3611
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,790
say what is happening to this quadratic
function.

3612
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:30,800
function.
 

3613
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,950
function.
This is very similar to problems that

3614
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:32,960
This is very similar to problems that
 

3615
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,390
This is very similar to problems that
those of you who have taken classes in

3616
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:34,400
those of you who have taken classes in
 

3617
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,950
those of you who have taken classes in
control theory might have already seen,

3618
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:36,960
control theory might have already seen,
 

3619
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,790
control theory might have already seen,
right? I see a controls person in the

3620
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:38,800
right? I see a controls person in the
 

3621
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,430
right? I see a controls person in the
room.

3622
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:41,440
room.
 

3623
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,910
room.
What you're trying to say is that this

3624
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:43,920
What you're trying to say is that this
 

3625
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,950
What you're trying to say is that this
is my loss function. How do I show that

3626
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:46,960
is my loss function. How do I show that
 

3627
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,750
is my loss function. How do I show that
is actually going to zero? One standard

3628
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:49,760
is actually going to zero? One standard
 

3629
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,070
is actually going to zero? One standard
technique for doing this is called

3630
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:52,080
technique for doing this is called
 

3631
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,390
technique for doing this is called
leapono functions. You don't need to

3632
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:54,400
leapono functions. You don't need to
 

3633
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,390
leapono functions. You don't need to
know what a leapono function is. But

3634
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,400
know what a leapono function is. But
 

3635
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,950
know what a leapono function is. But
what is the key idea? If I want to show

3636
01:19:58,950 --> 01:19:58,960
what is the key idea? If I want to show
 

3637
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,709
what is the key idea? If I want to show
that this thing goes to zero, well, if I

3638
01:20:02,709 --> 01:20:02,719
that this thing goes to zero, well, if I
 

3639
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:06,390
that this thing goes to zero, well, if I
can tell you that at every step I take,

3640
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:06,400
can tell you that at every step I take,
 

3641
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,189
can tell you that at every step I take,
I'm always decreasing,

3642
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:09,199
I'm always decreasing,
 

3643
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:12,070
I'm always decreasing,
I'm always only going down, and I

3644
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:12,080
I'm always only going down, and I
 

3645
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,149
I'm always only going down, and I
furthermore tell you that I'm lower

3646
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:14,159
furthermore tell you that I'm lower
 

3647
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,310
furthermore tell you that I'm lower
bounded by zero, that I can never cross

3648
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:16,320
bounded by zero, that I can never cross
 

3649
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,149
bounded by zero, that I can never cross
zero,

3650
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:18,159
zero,
 

3651
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:21,189
zero,
then where am I going to go? I have to

3652
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:21,199
then where am I going to go? I have to
 

3653
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,709
then where am I going to go? I have to
get to zero. Right? So basically, so you

3654
01:20:24,709 --> 01:20:24,719
get to zero. Right? So basically, so you
 

3655
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,070
get to zero. Right? So basically, so you
can you can prove this, you know, you

3656
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:26,080
can you can prove this, you know, you
 

3657
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,310
can you can prove this, you know, you
can analysis classes do this. There's

3658
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:28,320
can analysis classes do this. There's
 

3659
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,229
can analysis classes do this. There's
lots of ways of proving this. We're not

3660
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:30,239
lots of ways of proving this. We're not
 

3661
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,830
lots of ways of proving this. We're not
going to do that. Just believe me on

3662
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:31,840
going to do that. Just believe me on
 

3663
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,270
going to do that. Just believe me on
this principle. Intuitively, you can see

3664
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:33,280
this principle. Intuitively, you can see
 

3665
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,030
this principle. Intuitively, you can see
that, right? If you're rolling down a

3666
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:35,040
that, right? If you're rolling down a
 

3667
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,870
that, right? If you're rolling down a
hill, you're always moving downwards and

3668
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:36,880
hill, you're always moving downwards and
 

3669
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,229
hill, you're always moving downwards and
there's a floor, you can't get below

3670
01:20:38,229 --> 01:20:38,239
there's a floor, you can't get below
 

3671
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:39,510
there's a floor, you can't get below
that, you're eventually going to hit

3672
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:39,520
that, you're eventually going to hit
 

3673
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,070
that, you're eventually going to hit
that floor. So that's the technique that

3674
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:42,080
that floor. So that's the technique that
 

3675
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,229
that floor. So that's the technique that
we're going to use to argue that this

3676
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:44,239
we're going to use to argue that this
 

3677
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:46,870
we're going to use to argue that this
happens. And this is called the idea of

3678
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:46,880
happens. And this is called the idea of
 

3679
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,750
happens. And this is called the idea of
a leap of function.

3680
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:49,760
a leap of function.
 

3681
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,990
a leap of function.
I have one minute. I will probably talk

3682
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,000
I have one minute. I will probably talk
 

3683
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,430
I have one minute. I will probably talk
a little bit about this in the next

3684
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:53,440
a little bit about this in the next
 

3685
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,790
a little bit about this in the next
lecture. But what I want to tell you now

3686
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:56,800
lecture. But what I want to tell you now
 

3687
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,830
lecture. But what I want to tell you now
is that the key insight that we are

3688
01:20:59,830 --> 01:20:59,840
is that the key insight that we are
 

3689
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,390
is that the key insight that we are
going to get from doing this proof is

3690
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:02,400
going to get from doing this proof is
 

3691
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,149
going to get from doing this proof is
we're going to see how this loss

3692
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:04,159
we're going to see how this loss
 

3693
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,550
we're going to see how this loss
function evolves

3694
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:06,560
function evolves
 

3695
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,910
function evolves
as a function of time as you're taking

3696
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:09,920
as a function of time as you're taking
 

3697
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,070
as a function of time as you're taking
steps. And we'll see that there's a part

3698
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:12,080
steps. And we'll see that there's a part
 

3699
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,750
steps. And we'll see that there's a part
of it that looks kind of like gradient

3700
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:13,760
of it that looks kind of like gradient
 

3701
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,030
of it that looks kind of like gradient
descent. And that will show that the

3702
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:15,040
descent. And that will show that the
 

3703
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,030
descent. And that will show that the
loss function is decreasing. And there's

3704
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,040
loss function is decreasing. And there's
 

3705
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,149
loss function is decreasing. And there's
a part of it that we will show cannot

3706
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:20,159
a part of it that we will show cannot
 

3707
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,790
a part of it that we will show cannot
increase too much as long as your data

3708
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:22,800
increase too much as long as your data
 

3709
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,270
increase too much as long as your data
points are not too large. And that will

3710
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:25,280
points are not too large. And that will
 

3711
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,910
points are not too large. And that will
give us a intuition again or a condition

3712
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:27,920
give us a intuition again or a condition
 

3713
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,709
give us a intuition again or a condition
for why sometimes normalizing your data

3714
01:21:30,709 --> 01:21:30,719
for why sometimes normalizing your data
 

3715
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,189
for why sometimes normalizing your data
and things like that are important in uh

3716
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:33,199
and things like that are important in uh
 

3717
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:34,870
and things like that are important in uh
the deep learning problems that we care

01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:34,880
the deep learning problems that we care
 

3719
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,430
the deep learning problems that we care
about. So I'm out of time to do this in

about. So I'm out of time to do this in

about. So I'm out of time to do this in
detail. I will teach you the rest of
