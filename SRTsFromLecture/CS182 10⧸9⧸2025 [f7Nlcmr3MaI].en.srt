1
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,589

We're going to move on today to talk

2
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
We're going to move on today to talk
 

3
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,229
We're going to move on today to talk
about uh graph neural nets. And I wanted

4
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
about uh graph neural nets. And I wanted
 

5
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,470
about uh graph neural nets. And I wanted
to point out right now uh important

6
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
to point out right now uh important
 

7
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,030
to point out right now uh important
resources for you to have u if you want

8
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
resources for you to have u if you want
 

9
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,509
resources for you to have u if you want
to learn more. So first is of course

10
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
to learn more. So first is of course
 

11
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,869
to learn more. So first is of course
chapter 13 in Prince's book. So Prince

12
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
chapter 13 in Prince's book. So Prince
 

13
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,030
chapter 13 in Prince's book. So Prince
uh covers transformers before he talks

14
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
uh covers transformers before he talks
 

15
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,550
uh covers transformers before he talks
about uh graph neural. the treatment

16
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
about uh graph neural. the treatment
 

17
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,790
about uh graph neural. the treatment
will be a little different in character,

18
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
will be a little different in character,
 

19
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,990
will be a little different in character,
substantially different in character,

20
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
substantially different in character,
 

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,750
substantially different in character,
but it's still there's good stuff in

22
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
but it's still there's good stuff in
 

23
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,270
but it's still there's good stuff in
there.

24
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
there.
 

25
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,350
there.
There's a really nice uh blog post from

26
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
There's a really nice uh blog post from
 

27
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,670
There's a really nice uh blog post from
2021 on graph neural nets. We will

28
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,680
2021 on graph neural nets. We will
 

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,910
2021 on graph neural nets. We will
reference this in both the homework um I

30
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:09,920
reference this in both the homework um I
 

31
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,070
reference this in both the homework um I
think possibly also in the discussion uh

32
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
think possibly also in the discussion uh
 

33
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,309
think possibly also in the discussion uh
next week.

34
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,319
next week.
 

35
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,110
next week.
Uh our treatment in this class is going

36
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,120
Uh our treatment in this class is going
 

37
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,149
Uh our treatment in this class is going
to be limited on graph neural nets and

38
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
to be limited on graph neural nets and
 

39
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,869
to be limited on graph neural nets and
there's it's an incredibly important

40
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
there's it's an incredibly important
 

41
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,949
there's it's an incredibly important
topic practically.

42
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
topic practically.
 

43
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,030
topic practically.
So uh if if you want to learn more about

44
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
So uh if if you want to learn more about
 

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,869
So uh if if you want to learn more about
many different things, you should know

46
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
many different things, you should know
 

47
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,910
many different things, you should know
about uh the different software packages

48
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
about uh the different software packages
 

49
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,789
about uh the different software packages
uh you know pytor geometric for example

50
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
uh you know pytor geometric for example
 

51
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,830
uh you know pytor geometric for example
uh this deep graph library um and

52
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
uh this deep graph library um and
 

53
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,430
uh this deep graph library um and
spectral for those who like using

54
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
spectral for those who like using
 

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,149
spectral for those who like using
tensorflow um

56
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
tensorflow um
 

57
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,910
tensorflow um
and there's a lot of information in

58
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
and there's a lot of information in
 

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,190
and there's a lot of information in
there that deals with various practical

60
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
there that deals with various practical
 

61
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,670
there that deals with various practical
things that end up happening u I've only

62
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
things that end up happening u I've only
 

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,830
things that end up happening u I've only
mentioned these extremely briefly and

64
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
mentioned these extremely briefly and
 

65
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,390
mentioned these extremely briefly and
most I will not meion at all. Uh

66
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
most I will not meion at all. Uh
 

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,949
most I will not meion at all. Uh
Stanford has a really nice course on

68
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
Stanford has a really nice course on
 

69
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,110
Stanford has a really nice course on
graph neural nets. So one of the real

70
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
graph neural nets. So one of the real
 

71
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,509
graph neural nets. So one of the real
leaders of the field uh is a professor

72
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
leaders of the field uh is a professor
 

73
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,750
leaders of the field uh is a professor
there and this class has a lot of useful

74
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
there and this class has a lot of useful
 

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,190
there and this class has a lot of useful
information if you really want to go

76
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
information if you really want to go
 

77
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,789
information if you really want to go
deeper in graph neural nets. Uh so I

78
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
deeper in graph neural nets. Uh so I
 

79
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,470
deeper in graph neural nets. Uh so I
want to point these resources out in

80
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
want to point these resources out in
 

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,229
want to point these resources out in
case for people who want to want to use

82
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
case for people who want to want to use
 

83
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,750
case for people who want to want to use
them.

84
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
them.
 

85
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,150
them.
Uh I we mentioned it on the last lecture

86
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
Uh I we mentioned it on the last lecture
 

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,030
Uh I we mentioned it on the last lecture
but uh in response to student demand we

88
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
but uh in response to student demand we
 

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,150
but uh in response to student demand we
have moved uh TA office hour from the

90
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
have moved uh TA office hour from the
 

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,189
have moved uh TA office hour from the
last office hour on Tuesday to Friday at

92
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
last office hour on Tuesday to Friday at
 

93
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,510
last office hour on Tuesday to Friday at
in 5:31 Corey at 2 to 3 p.m. So please

94
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
in 5:31 Corey at 2 to 3 p.m. So please
 

95
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,909
in 5:31 Corey at 2 to 3 p.m. So please
take advantage of that.

96
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
take advantage of that.
 

97
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,790
take advantage of that.
Um and with that I'll just uh continue

98
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
Um and with that I'll just uh continue
 

99
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,510
Um and with that I'll just uh continue
with the material. So we're moving from

100
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
with the material. So we're moving from
 

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,270
with the material. So we're moving from
in the class we talked about MLPS first

102
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
in the class we talked about MLPS first
 

103
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,550
in the class we talked about MLPS first
and you've seen them before in our

104
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
and you've seen them before in our
 

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,030
and you've seen them before in our
earlier classes to CNN's which some of

106
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
earlier classes to CNN's which some of
 

107
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,710
earlier classes to CNN's which some of
you may or may not have seen um before.

108
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
you may or may not have seen um before.
 

109
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,070
you may or may not have seen um before.
or in fact many people seem to have seen

110
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
or in fact many people seem to have seen
 

111
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,230
or in fact many people seem to have seen
them before to but hopefully the

112
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
them before to but hopefully the
 

113
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,189
them before to but hopefully the
treatment here helped you understand

114
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
treatment here helped you understand
 

115
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,070
treatment here helped you understand
them better uh to graph neural nets

116
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
them better uh to graph neural nets
 

117
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,830
them better uh to graph neural nets
which many of you have not seen before

118
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
which many of you have not seen before
 

119
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,469
which many of you have not seen before
but some of you may have

120
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
but some of you may have
 

121
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,469
but some of you may have
so the pictures that we saw before where

122
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
so the pictures that we saw before where
 

123
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,230
so the pictures that we saw before where
you know an MLP sort of everything is

124
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
you know an MLP sort of everything is
 

125
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,790
you know an MLP sort of everything is
connected to everything else uh because

126
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
connected to everything else uh because
 

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,350
connected to everything else uh because
you don't know what's going on uh in

128
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
you don't know what's going on uh in
 

129
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,270
you don't know what's going on uh in
terms of any particular information

130
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
terms of any particular information
 

131
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,390
terms of any particular information
structure about the inputs anything

132
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
structure about the inputs anything
 

133
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,790
structure about the inputs anything
could be important for anything else to

134
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
could be important for anything else to
 

135
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,990
could be important for anything else to
CNN's where you had this structure that

136
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
CNN's where you had this structure that
 

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,590
CNN's where you had this structure that
said there is a locality to the inputs

138
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
said there is a locality to the inputs
 

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,670
said there is a locality to the inputs
nearby pixels have to do with each other

140
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
nearby pixels have to do with each other
 

141
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,590
nearby pixels have to do with each other
probably and the processing took

142
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
probably and the processing took
 

143
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,670
probably and the processing took
advantage of that and so graph neural

144
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
advantage of that and so graph neural
 

145
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,550
advantage of that and so graph neural
nets are about generalizing this so

146
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
nets are about generalizing this so
 

147
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,310
nets are about generalizing this so
instead of the kind of things we saw

148
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:32,320
instead of the kind of things we saw
 

149
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,710
instead of the kind of things we saw
before where we have images that we want

150
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
before where we have images that we want
 

151
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,790
before where we have images that we want
to do something to we're going to have

152
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
to do something to we're going to have
 

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,510
to do something to we're going to have
graphs okay so very briefly

154
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
graphs okay so very briefly
 

155
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,310
graphs okay so very briefly
I wanted to just you know quickly just

156
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
I wanted to just you know quickly just
 

157
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,830
I wanted to just you know quickly just
put on here so you can go and reference

158
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
put on here so you can go and reference
 

159
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,670
put on here so you can go and reference
it when I put these up for everybody

160
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
it when I put these up for everybody
 

161
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,070
it when I put these up for everybody
that we've learned many concepts in the

162
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
that we've learned many concepts in the
 

163
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,029
that we've learned many concepts in the
context of CNN. And one of the most

164
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
context of CNN. And one of the most
 

165
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,350
context of CNN. And one of the most
useful things about graph neural net

166
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
useful things about graph neural net
 

167
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,350
useful things about graph neural net
from a pedagogical point of view is it

168
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
from a pedagogical point of view is it
 

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,749
from a pedagogical point of view is it
helps you see which of these concepts

170
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
helps you see which of these concepts
 

171
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,870
helps you see which of these concepts
were actually just tied to CNN's and

172
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
were actually just tied to CNN's and
 

173
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,029
were actually just tied to CNN's and
which ones are actually more general and

174
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
which ones are actually more general and
 

175
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,550
which ones are actually more general and
to appreciate them in a little bit more

176
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
to appreciate them in a little bit more
 

177
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,870
to appreciate them in a little bit more
of their general form. This will help

178
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
of their general form. This will help
 

179
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,070
of their general form. This will help
you when thinking about new

180
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
you when thinking about new
 

181
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,830
you when thinking about new
architectures.

182
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
architectures.
 

183
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,749
architectures.
Okay, so everything up here you should

184
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
Okay, so everything up here you should
 

185
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,629
Okay, so everything up here you should
you we've talked about. Um there's one

186
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
you we've talked about. Um there's one
 

187
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,110
you we've talked about. Um there's one
loose end that I realized in uh office

188
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
loose end that I realized in uh office
 

189
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,710
loose end that I realized in uh office
hours someone asked about I realized I

190
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
hours someone asked about I realized I
 

191
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,749
hours someone asked about I realized I
hadn't talked about it. So I wanted to

192
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
hadn't talked about it. So I wanted to
 

193
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,350
hadn't talked about it. So I wanted to
quickly mention this tie up this one

194
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
quickly mention this tie up this one
 

195
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,070
quickly mention this tie up this one
loose end which is this is a form of

196
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
loose end which is this is a form of
 

197
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,230
loose end which is this is a form of
dropout which is called stochastic depth

198
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
dropout which is called stochastic depth
 

199
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,990
dropout which is called stochastic depth
regularization.

200
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
regularization.
 

201
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,909
regularization.
Okay, it's extremely simple as an idea

202
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
Okay, it's extremely simple as an idea
 

203
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,749
Okay, it's extremely simple as an idea
but I should just make sure you you've

204
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
but I should just make sure you you've
 

205
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,110
but I should just make sure you you've
heard about it. And so in dropout

206
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
heard about it. And so in dropout
 

207
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,110
heard about it. And so in dropout
remember we use dropout for MLPS where

208
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
remember we use dropout for MLPS where
 

209
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,309
remember we use dropout for MLPS where
we individually remove for a particular

210
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
we individually remove for a particular
 

211
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,670
we individually remove for a particular
training done run certain inputs to the

212
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
training done run certain inputs to the
 

213
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,110
training done run certain inputs to the
MLP we just zero them out. Okay we we

214
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
MLP we just zero them out. Okay we we
 

215
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,710
MLP we just zero them out. Okay we we
call this a kind of data augmentation

216
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
call this a kind of data augmentation
 

217
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,710
call this a kind of data augmentation
that we do for intermediate layers. Okay

218
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
that we do for intermediate layers. Okay
 

219
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,830
that we do for intermediate layers. Okay
so stochastic depth regularization is

220
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
so stochastic depth regularization is
 

221
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,230
so stochastic depth regularization is
doing the same thing removing something

222
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
doing the same thing removing something
 

223
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,550
doing the same thing removing something
with some probability except it does it

224
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
with some probability except it does it
 

225
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,350
with some probability except it does it
at the level of an entire block.

226
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
at the level of an entire block.
 

227
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,589
at the level of an entire block.
So it says with some probability in a

228
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
So it says with some probability in a
 

229
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,909
So it says with some probability in a
resnet you'll just remove this block

230
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
resnet you'll just remove this block
 

231
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,270
resnet you'll just remove this block
entirely just wipe it up. So instead of

232
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
entirely just wipe it up. So instead of
 

233
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,749
entirely just wipe it up. So instead of
having something with a skip connection

234
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
having something with a skip connection
 

235
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,749
having something with a skip connection
you just have the skip connection.

236
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
you just have the skip connection.
 

237
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,950
you just have the skip connection.
Okay so in terms of mechanics that is

238
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
Okay so in terms of mechanics that is
 

239
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,469
Okay so in terms of mechanics that is
the full explanation. It takes one

240
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
the full explanation. It takes one
 

241
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,830
the full explanation. It takes one
minute. Okay but you should know this

242
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
minute. Okay but you should know this
 

243
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,550
minute. Okay but you should know this
exists and its purpose is light dropout.

244
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
exists and its purpose is light dropout.
 

245
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,950
exists and its purpose is light dropout.
This is used to help with overfitting

246
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
This is used to help with overfitting
 

247
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,350
This is used to help with overfitting
and for creating a kind of redundancy.

248
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
and for creating a kind of redundancy.
 

249
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,430
and for creating a kind of redundancy.
So in dropout we said what it did was it

250
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
So in dropout we said what it did was it
 

251
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,350
So in dropout we said what it did was it
forced information to be carried not

252
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
forced information to be carried not
 

253
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,629
forced information to be carried not
just in one particular activation but

254
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
just in one particular activation but
 

255
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,550
just in one particular activation but
across many activations added some

256
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
across many activations added some
 

257
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,230
across many activations added some
redundancy

258
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
redundancy
 

259
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,070
redundancy
because after all any one thing can be

260
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
because after all any one thing can be
 

261
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,230
because after all any one thing can be
dropped out. So the same thing applies

262
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
dropped out. So the same thing applies
 

263
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,469
dropped out. So the same thing applies
here at the level of blocks. This

264
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:56,479
here at the level of blocks. This
 

265
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,670
here at the level of blocks. This
creates a kind of functional redundancy

266
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
creates a kind of functional redundancy
 

267
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,749
creates a kind of functional redundancy
that you can't have this particular

268
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
that you can't have this particular
 

269
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,909
that you can't have this particular
block doing a very special thing that

270
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
block doing a very special thing that
 

271
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,990
block doing a very special thing that
this particular block hasn't done any

272
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
this particular block hasn't done any
 

273
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,150
this particular block hasn't done any
of. They all should be doing some things

274
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
of. They all should be doing some things
 

275
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,309
of. They all should be doing some things
kind of a little bit shared.

276
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319

 

277
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,309

There are other reasons for doing uh

278
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
There are other reasons for doing uh
 

279
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,070
There are other reasons for doing uh
stocastic depth regularization that you

280
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
stocastic depth regularization that you
 

281
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,469
stocastic depth regularization that you
can read about uh in terms of why people

282
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
can read about uh in terms of why people
 

283
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,430
can read about uh in terms of why people
think it works. uh empirically people

284
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
think it works. uh empirically people
 

285
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,589
think it works. uh empirically people
find in many situations it helps

286
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
find in many situations it helps
 

287
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,670
find in many situations it helps
it has another little advantage during

288
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
it has another little advantage during
 

289
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,990
it has another little advantage during
training uh which is different than

290
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
training uh which is different than
 

291
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,709
training uh which is different than
dropout in dropout when you zero out

292
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
dropout in dropout when you zero out
 

293
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,230
dropout in dropout when you zero out
some things it doesn't really help you

294
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
some things it doesn't really help you
 

295
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,149
some things it doesn't really help you
computationally because it's an MLP that

296
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
computationally because it's an MLP that
 

297
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,670
computationally because it's an MLP that
you're dropping stuff out from and you

298
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
you're dropping stuff out from and you
 

299
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,949
you're dropping stuff out from and you
can't really take advantage of this

300
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
can't really take advantage of this
 

301
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,550
can't really take advantage of this
unstructured sparity that you just

302
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
unstructured sparity that you just
 

303
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,670
unstructured sparity that you just
introduced in terms of the computation

304
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
introduced in terms of the computation
 

305
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,350
introduced in terms of the computation
but here you can take advantage of it

306
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
but here you can take advantage of it
 

307
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,110
but here you can take advantage of it
computationally you don't have to do

308
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
computationally you don't have to do
 

309
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,230
computationally you don't have to do
anything for the block you dropped out.

310
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
anything for the block you dropped out.
 

311
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,630
anything for the block you dropped out.
So buys you little little bits of

312
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
So buys you little little bits of
 

313
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,030
So buys you little little bits of
computational savings. Uh if you know

314
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
computational savings. Uh if you know
 

315
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,790
computational savings. Uh if you know
10% of the blocks are being dropped out,

316
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
10% of the blocks are being dropped out,
 

317
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,750
10% of the blocks are being dropped out,
you can run the entire operation, you

318
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
you can run the entire operation, you
 

319
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,070
you can run the entire operation, you
know, without doing that 10% of work as

320
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
know, without doing that 10% of work as
 

321
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,949
know, without doing that 10% of work as
well.

322
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
well.
 

323
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,670
well.

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
>> Yes. Question.
 

325
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,990
>> Yes. Question.

values for the dropout percentage?

328
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
values for the dropout percentage?
 

329
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,389
values for the dropout percentage?
>> Uh typical probabilities are so in

330
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
>> Uh typical probabilities are so in
 

331
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,590

dropout for MLPS you go like 50 or 10%.

332
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
dropout for MLPS you go like 50 or 10%.
 

333
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,150
dropout for MLPS you go like 50 or 10%.
Here it's more like 10. Um there's

334
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
Here it's more like 10. Um there's
 

335
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,670
Here it's more like 10. Um there's
different schedules that people use for

336
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
different schedules that people use for
 

337
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,829
different schedules that people use for
dropout uh for stocastic death

338
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
dropout uh for stocastic death
 

339
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,389
dropout uh for stocastic death
regularization. Sometimes they will drop

340
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
regularization. Sometimes they will drop
 

341
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,790
regularization. Sometimes they will drop
stuff out earlier more often than

342
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
stuff out earlier more often than
 

343
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,070
stuff out earlier more often than
they'll drop stuff out later. Um this

344
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
they'll drop stuff out later. Um this
 

345
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,310
they'll drop stuff out later. Um this
different scalings they use but you can

346
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
different scalings they use but you can
 

347
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,150
different scalings they use but you can
read about it. So again the rule is

348
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
read about it. So again the rule is
 

349
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,829
read about it. So again the rule is
always the same. If you're working on

350
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
always the same. If you're working on
 

351
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,990
always the same. If you're working on
something and you're experiencing

352
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
something and you're experiencing
 

353
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,310
something and you're experiencing
overfitting you say okay what are my

354
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320

355
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,910
overfitting you say okay what are my
list of things I could do? Look at other

356
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
list of things I could do? Look at other
 

357
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,310
list of things I could do? Look at other
papers. if they did stocastic death

358
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
papers. if they did stocastic death
 

359
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,150
papers. if they did stocastic death
regularization you'd be like maybe I

360
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
regularization you'd be like maybe I
 

361
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,470
regularization you'd be like maybe I
should try that okay that's the

362
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
should try that okay that's the
 

363
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,590
should try that okay that's the
practical import but you should know

364
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
practical import but you should know
 

365
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,509
practical import but you should know
what it is

366
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
what it is
 

367
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,350
what it is
okay so now let's start into uh the GNN

368
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
okay so now let's start into uh the GNN
 

369
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,630
okay so now let's start into uh the GNN
topic so the big picture of generalizing

370
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
topic so the big picture of generalizing
 

371
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,630

CNN's is to say images have local

372
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
CNN's is to say images have local
 

373
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,350

object class we know about that captures

376
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
object class we know about that captures
 

377
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,070
object class we know about that captures
the idea of local structure and those

378
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,080
the idea of local structure and those
 

379
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,990
the idea of local structure and those
are graphs

380
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
are graphs
 

381
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,269
are graphs
Okay, so graphs also occur because they

382
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:13,279
Okay, so graphs also occur because they
 

383
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,590
Okay, so graphs also occur because they
do this. They occur in lots and lots of

384
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
do this. They occur in lots and lots of
 

385
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,630
do this. They occur in lots and lots of
uh potential applications. So, you know,

386
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
uh potential applications. So, you know,
 

387
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,710
uh potential applications. So, you know,
here's a picture from Prince that sort

also you have who buys what in

404
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
also you have who buys what in
 

405
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,509
also you have who buys what in
commercial settings. Hopefully these

406
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
commercial settings. Hopefully these
 

407
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,949

graph neural nets are extremely

410
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
graph neural nets are extremely
 

411
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,310
graph neural nets are extremely
practically significant. Um because

412
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
practically significant. Um because
 

413
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,470
practically significant. Um because

you really care about that graph and

418
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
you really care about that graph and
 

419
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,230
you really care about that graph and
really would like to make predictions uh

420
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
really would like to make predictions uh
 

421
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,949
really would like to make predictions uh
based on that information.

00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
based on that information.
 

423
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,430
based on that information.
Um you also have you know so networks

424
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
Um you also have you know so networks
 

425
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,910
Um you also have you know so networks
that have lots of labels you also have

426
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:07,920
that have lots of labels you also have
 

427
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,509
that have lots of labels you also have

electrical circuits you have graph

436
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
electrical circuits you have graph
 

437
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,030
electrical circuits you have graph
structures so here's an example of a

438
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
structures so here's an example of a
 

439
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,670
structures so here's an example of a
graph kind of showing the kind of meshes

440
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
graph kind of showing the kind of meshes
 

441
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,670
graph kind of showing the kind of meshes
that happen when you're thinking about

442
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
that happen when you're thinking about
 

443
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,829
that happen when you're thinking about
3D modeling

444
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:25,839
3D modeling
 

445
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,310
3D modeling
and graphs have also played a role in

446
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
and graphs have also played a role in
 

447
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,069
and graphs have also played a role in
computer vision where you want to

448
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
computer vision where you want to
 

449
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,069
computer vision where you want to
express the interreationship of objects

450
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
express the interreationship of objects
 

451
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,630
express the interreationship of objects
to each other. So graphs are useful

452
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
to each other. So graphs are useful
 

453
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,269
to each other. So graphs are useful
things to have around.

454
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
things to have around.
 

455
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,670
things to have around.
And so the question is

456
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
And so the question is
 

457
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,829
And so the question is
how can we take advantage of the graph

458
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
how can we take advantage of the graph
 

459
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,710
how can we take advantage of the graph
and build a deep neural network that

460
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
and build a deep neural network that
 

461
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,990
and build a deep neural network that
takes advantage of the graph structure.

462
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
takes advantage of the graph structure.
 

463
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,670
takes advantage of the graph structure.
Okay, everyone see the kind of big

464
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
Okay, everyone see the kind of big
 

465
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,829
Okay, everyone see the kind of big
picture here? So uh in terms of

466
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
picture here? So uh in terms of
 

467
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,509
picture here? So uh in terms of
practical importance, I mentioned some

468
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
practical importance, I mentioned some
 

469
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,030
practical importance, I mentioned some
examples here. The other place where

470
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
examples here. The other place where
 

471
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,550
examples here. The other place where
they're extremely important is

472
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
they're extremely important is
 

473
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,829
they're extremely important is
chemistry. and materials because as you

474
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
chemistry. and materials because as you
 

475
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,750
chemistry. and materials because as you
can imagine molecules are naturally

476
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
can imagine molecules are naturally
 

477
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,829
can imagine molecules are naturally
graphs um and so they play a huge role

478
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
graphs um and so they play a huge role
 

479
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,829
graphs um and so they play a huge role
there and in other domains in physics so

480
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
there and in other domains in physics so
 

481
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,750
there and in other domains in physics so
lots of physics inspired neural net

482
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
lots of physics inspired neural net
 

483
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,829
lots of physics inspired neural net
stuff involves graph neural nets

484
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
stuff involves graph neural nets
 

485
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,829
stuff involves graph neural nets
okay so now let's start building some

486
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
okay so now let's start building some
 

487
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,030
okay so now let's start building some
analogies the basic kind of question

488
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
analogies the basic kind of question
 

489
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,350
analogies the basic kind of question
that we started off when we talked about

490
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360
that we started off when we talked about
 

491
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,949
that we started off when we talked about
CNN's was the idea of image

492
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
CNN's was the idea of image
 

493
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,430
CNN's was the idea of image
classification right you have an image

494
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
classification right you have an image
 

495
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,430
classification right you have an image
and you say is this an image of a dog, a

496
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
and you say is this an image of a dog, a
 

497
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,230
and you say is this an image of a dog, a
cat, an airplane and so on. The

498
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
cat, an airplane and so on. The
 

499
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,710
cat, an airplane and so on. The
counterpart in graph neural nets is

500
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
counterpart in graph neural nets is
 

501
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,949
counterpart in graph neural nets is
called graph classification. So you're

502
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
called graph classification. So you're
 

503
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,670
called graph classification. So you're
given a graph and the entire graph has

504
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
given a graph and the entire graph has
 

505
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,910
given a graph and the entire graph has
to be digested and understood and then

506
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
to be digested and understood and then
 

507
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,670
to be digested and understood and then
you say something about it. I think the

508
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
you say something about it. I think the
 

509
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,430
you say something about it. I think the
example in that blog post uh is

510
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
example in that blog post uh is
 

511
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,710
example in that blog post uh is
here's a chemical. Does it smell or not?

512
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
here's a chemical. Does it smell or not?
 

513
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,190
here's a chemical. Does it smell or not?
Is it a smelly chemical? Right? So you

514
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200
Is it a smelly chemical? Right? So you
 

515
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,230
Is it a smelly chemical? Right? So you
see that's kind of a property of the

516
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
see that's kind of a property of the
 

517
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,230
see that's kind of a property of the
entire graph.

518
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
entire graph.
 

519
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,190
entire graph.
So you know you have some information

520
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,200
So you know you have some information
 

521
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,710
So you know you have some information
that's used it comes in on a graph

522
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
that's used it comes in on a graph
 

523
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,629
that's used it comes in on a graph
like images

524
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
like images
 

525
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,870
like images
every information will be expressed in

526
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
every information will be expressed in
 

527
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,590
every information will be expressed in
vectors in in your input and then you do

528
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
vectors in in your input and then you do
 

529
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,269
vectors in in your input and then you do
some processing in a graph neural net

530
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
some processing in a graph neural net
 

531
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,710
some processing in a graph neural net
and then you get a classifier at the

532
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
and then you get a classifier at the
 

533
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,790
and then you get a classifier at the
end. Okay that's like a classification

534
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
end. Okay that's like a classification
 

535
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,629
end. Okay that's like a classification
style problem.

536
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
style problem.
 

537
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,870
style problem.
But just like we had semantic

538
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
But just like we had semantic
 

539
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,110
But just like we had semantic
segmentation which was a pixel level

540
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
segmentation which was a pixel level
 

541
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,629
segmentation which was a pixel level
problem.

542
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
problem.
 

543
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,949
problem.
You have a counterpart in graphs which

544
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
You have a counterpart in graphs which
 

545
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,629
You have a counterpart in graphs which
you can think of as a node level

546
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
you can think of as a node level
 

547
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,590
you can think of as a node level
problem. So you have a graph and you

548
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
problem. So you have a graph and you
 

549
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,030
problem. So you have a graph and you
would like to do some kind of

550
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,040
would like to do some kind of
 

551
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,870
would like to do some kind of
classification at every node.

552
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
classification at every node.
 

553
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,870
classification at every node.
Okay, hopefully this is very natural.

554
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
Okay, hopefully this is very natural.
 

555
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,829
Okay, hopefully this is very natural.
And because graphs have nodes and edges,

556
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
And because graphs have nodes and edges,
 

557
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,629
And because graphs have nodes and edges,
you can do the same thing for edges.

558
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
you can do the same thing for edges.
 

559
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,430
you can do the same thing for edges.
And for edges you can also have this uh

560
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
And for edges you can also have this uh
 

561
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,150
And for edges you can also have this uh
other might seem as a conceptually

562
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
other might seem as a conceptually
 

563
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,069
other might seem as a conceptually
distinct thing is even saying should

564
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
distinct thing is even saying should
 

565
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,110
distinct thing is even saying should
this edge exist.

566
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,120
this edge exist.
 

567
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,350
this edge exist.
Right now in our treatment here we're

568
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
Right now in our treatment here we're
 

569
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,790
Right now in our treatment here we're
going to focus entirely at the node

570
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
going to focus entirely at the node
 

571
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,030
going to focus entirely at the node
level but everything we talk about can

572
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
level but everything we talk about can
 

573
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,710
level but everything we talk about can
be generalized to thinking about edges

574
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
be generalized to thinking about edges
 

575
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,430
be generalized to thinking about edges
as well. Okay.

576
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440

 

577
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,790

So everyone get the kind of big picture

578
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
So everyone get the kind of big picture
 

579
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,150
So everyone get the kind of big picture
of the mapping. So this is the first

580
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
of the mapping. So this is the first
 

581
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,990
of the mapping. So this is the first
level of mapping. Ask yourself the

582
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
level of mapping. Ask yourself the
 

583
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,750
level of mapping. Ask yourself the
question given the things you know how

584
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
question given the things you know how
 

585
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,990
question given the things you know how
to do in CNN's what are the counterpart

586
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
to do in CNN's what are the counterpart
 

587
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,269
to do in CNN's what are the counterpart
things you could imagine doing in a

588
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
things you could imagine doing in a
 

589
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,509
things you could imagine doing in a
graph are they useful or not and yeah

590
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
graph are they useful or not and yeah
 

591
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,470
graph are they useful or not and yeah
they're useful so here we talk about in

592
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
they're useful so here we talk about in
 

593
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,389
they're useful so here we talk about in
terms of classification

594
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
terms of classification
 

595
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,389
terms of classification
but you can also think about it in terms

596
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
but you can also think about it in terms
 

597
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,670
but you can also think about it in terms
of regression so classic example is

598
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
of regression so classic example is
 

599
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,790
of regression so classic example is
here's a molecule graph tell me the

600
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:32,800
here's a molecule graph tell me the
 

601
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,350
here's a molecule graph tell me the
three-dimensional position of the

602
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
three-dimensional position of the
 

603
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,230
three-dimensional position of the
individual atoms when this is being

604
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,240
individual atoms when this is being
 

605
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,949
individual atoms when this is being
immersed in a solution with a certain pH

606
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
immersed in a solution with a certain pH
 

607
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,350
immersed in a solution with a certain pH
Right. Very important practical

608
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
Right. Very important practical
 

609
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,750
Right. Very important practical
question.

610
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760

 

611
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,910

Okay. So hopefully everyone's on board

612
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
Okay. So hopefully everyone's on board
 

613
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,509
Okay. So hopefully everyone's on board
with uh what we're trying to do.

614
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
with uh what we're trying to do.
 

615
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,110
with uh what we're trying to do.
And so now to understand graph neural

616
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
And so now to understand graph neural
 

617
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,110
And so now to understand graph neural
nets, we're going to start with the

618
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
nets, we're going to start with the
 

619
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,310
nets, we're going to start with the
simplest conceptual step which is we're

620
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
simplest conceptual step which is we're
 

621
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,230
simplest conceptual step which is we're
going to think about images which we

622
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
going to think about images which we
 

623
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,389
going to think about images which we
know how to do as though they are

624
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
know how to do as though they are
 

625
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,829
know how to do as though they are
graphs.

626
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
graphs.
 

627
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,430
graphs.
We'll understand what kind of graph they

628
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
We'll understand what kind of graph they
 

629
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,350
We'll understand what kind of graph they
are most naturally and then what would

630
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
are most naturally and then what would
 

631
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,110
are most naturally and then what would
we do which is we'll do the same thing

632
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
we do which is we'll do the same thing
 

633
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,949
we do which is we'll do the same thing
we did before except we're going to

634
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
we did before except we're going to
 

635
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,350
we did before except we're going to
think about it as a graph everyone see

636
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
think about it as a graph everyone see
 

637
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,470
think about it as a graph everyone see
this as a good way if you want to

638
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
this as a good way if you want to
 

639
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,389
this as a good way if you want to
generalize something you want to say

640
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:22,399
generalize something you want to say
 

641
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,710
generalize something you want to say
okay what is it that you know let me

642
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
okay what is it that you know let me
 

643
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,710
okay what is it that you know let me
understand what I know with a lens

644
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
understand what I know with a lens
 

645
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,550
understand what I know with a lens
towards the more general picture I want

646
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
towards the more general picture I want
 

647
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,550
towards the more general picture I want
to look at so I can see what I might

648
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,560
to look at so I can see what I might
 

649
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,430
to look at so I can see what I might
need to change

650
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
need to change
 

651
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,710
need to change
okay so here's a very simple picture so

652
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
okay so here's a very simple picture so
 

653
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,430
okay so here's a very simple picture so
I've dri I've made a little image hair.

654
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
I've dri I've made a little image hair.
 

655
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,829
I've dri I've made a little image hair.
Can everyone can see this little image?

656
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
Can everyone can see this little image?
 

657
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,310
Can everyone can see this little image?
And just for reasons of visual uh

658
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
And just for reasons of visual uh
 

659
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,990
And just for reasons of visual uh
depiction, I've used fours for the

660
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
depiction, I've used fours for the
 

661
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,230
depiction, I've used fours for the
smiley and ones for the background. So

662
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
smiley and ones for the background. So
 

663
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,790
smiley and ones for the background. So
you can see the different colors.

664
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:50,800
you can see the different colors.
 

665
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,389
you can see the different colors.
And

666
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
And
 

667
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,710
And
we're going to think of nodes in the

668
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
we're going to think of nodes in the
 

669
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,550
we're going to think of nodes in the
graph as being pixels in the image.

670
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
graph as being pixels in the image.
 

671
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,949
graph as being pixels in the image.
Okay? So there's this pixel, which is

672
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
Okay? So there's this pixel, which is
 

673
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,910
Okay? So there's this pixel, which is
the top corner of the image. It happens

674
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:03,920
the top corner of the image. It happens
 

675
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,030
the top corner of the image. It happens
to have a value in it, namely one.

676
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
to have a value in it, namely one.
 

677
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,710
to have a value in it, namely one.
So I'm going to think of it as a node.

678
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
So I'm going to think of it as a node.
 

679
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,030
So I'm going to think of it as a node.
There's a particular node here and it

680
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
There's a particular node here and it
 

681
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,110
There's a particular node here and it
has a value one

682
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
has a value one
 

683
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,590
has a value one
and the local neighborhood structure of

684
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
and the local neighborhood structure of
 

685
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,670
and the local neighborhood structure of
the image which was expressed by the

686
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
the image which was expressed by the
 

687
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,470
the image which was expressed by the
array in a CNN. I want to make it

688
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
array in a CNN. I want to make it
 

689
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,790
array in a CNN. I want to make it
explicit as a graph. So

690
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
explicit as a graph. So
 

691
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,189
explicit as a graph. So
let's look at this little section here

692
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
let's look at this little section here
 

693
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,749
let's look at this little section here
and blow it up. Okay. So let me make

694
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
and blow it up. Okay. So let me make
 

695
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,950
and blow it up. Okay. So let me make
this bigger.

696
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:31,960
this bigger.
 

697
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,110
this bigger.
[Applause]

698
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
[Applause]
 

699
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,790
[Applause]
So if I want to express the information

700
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
So if I want to express the information
 

701
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,430
So if I want to express the information
in this little section as a graph in

702
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
in this little section as a graph in
 

703
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,470
in this little section as a graph in
terms of what the neighborhood

704
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
terms of what the neighborhood
 

705
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,949
terms of what the neighborhood
relationships are,

706
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
relationships are,
 

707
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,509
relationships are,
I can say for example this one is the

708
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
I can say for example this one is the
 

709
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,230
I can say for example this one is the
one I'm calling here the center one. It

710
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
one I'm calling here the center one. It
 

711
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,550
one I'm calling here the center one. It
has neighbors.

712
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
has neighbors.
 

713
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,150
has neighbors.
So I can think of it as having neighbors

714
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
So I can think of it as having neighbors
 

715
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,949
So I can think of it as having neighbors
as having edges to the neighbors.

716
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
as having edges to the neighbors.
 

717
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,590
as having edges to the neighbors.
But you can think of it this way. You

718
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
But you can think of it this way. You
 

719
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,069
But you can think of it this way. You
can think of an edge between this one,

720
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
can think of an edge between this one,
 

721
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,910
can think of an edge between this one,
which is this one here, and this one

722
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
which is this one here, and this one
 

723
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,909
which is this one here, and this one
that says this particular node

724
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
that says this particular node
 

725
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,029
that says this particular node
has information coming from the north

726
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:09,039
has information coming from the north
 

727
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,350
has information coming from the north
from this guy. You can use like like I

728
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360
from this guy. You can use like like I
 

729
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,390
from this guy. You can use like like I
did before, right? North,

730
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
did before, right? North,
 

731
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,909
did before, right? North,
south,outheast, west. And this

732
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
south,outheast, west. And this
 

733
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,549
south,outheast, west. And this
particular node has information coming

734
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
particular node has information coming
 

735
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,350
particular node has information coming
from the south from this one.

736
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
from the south from this one.
 

737
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,990
from the south from this one.
So, first thing you notice is there's a

738
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
So, first thing you notice is there's a
 

739
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,750
So, first thing you notice is there's a
relationship between these two. And for

740
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
relationship between these two. And for
 

741
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,829
relationship between these two. And for
a connet, the kind of stuff we did in a

742
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
a connet, the kind of stuff we did in a
 

743
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,390
a connet, the kind of stuff we did in a
convent, it matters,

744
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
convent, it matters,
 

745
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,549
convent, it matters,
you know what that ordering is because

746
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
you know what that ordering is because
 

747
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,830
you know what that ordering is because
there's a difference between the image

748
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
there's a difference between the image
 

749
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,390
there's a difference between the image
and the image upside down.

750
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
and the image upside down.
 

751
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,310
and the image upside down.
Does everyone see that? So I have to

752
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
Does everyone see that? So I have to
 

753
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,710
Does everyone see that? So I have to
have both those edges. So first thing we

754
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
have both those edges. So first thing we
 

755
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,310
have both those edges. So first thing we
notice is what kind of thing is like a

756
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
notice is what kind of thing is like a
 

757
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,950
notice is what kind of thing is like a
directed graph. It's a directed graph

758
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
directed graph. It's a directed graph
 

759
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,510
directed graph. It's a directed graph
and it has labels on the edges that tell

760
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
and it has labels on the edges that tell
 

761
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,270
and it has labels on the edges that tell
what kind of relationship those two

762
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
what kind of relationship those two
 

763
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,029
what kind of relationship those two
things have.

764
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
things have.
 

765
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,830
things have.
And similarly you have west and east and

766
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
And similarly you have west and east and
 

767
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,510
And similarly you have west and east and
you know then you have southeast

768
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
you know then you have southeast
 

769
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,909
you know then you have southeast
northwest and all these other edges.

770
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919

 

771
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,830

So I'll I'll pause here. Any questions

772
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
So I'll I'll pause here. Any questions
 

773
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,230
So I'll I'll pause here. Any questions
on this sort of bigger the story that

774
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
on this sort of bigger the story that
 

775
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,150
on this sort of bigger the story that
we're doing. So we have an image. We can

776
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
we're doing. So we have an image. We can
 

777
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,070
we're doing. So we have an image. We can
view the image as a graph. This is how

778
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
view the image as a graph. This is how
 

779
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,070
view the image as a graph. This is how
we would for example view it as a graph.

780
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
we would for example view it as a graph.
 

781
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,830
we would for example view it as a graph.
And of course the edges continue on out.

782
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
And of course the edges continue on out.
 

783
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,470
And of course the edges continue on out.
I just zoomed in in one little place.

784
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
I just zoomed in in one little place.
 

785
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,310
I just zoomed in in one little place.
Any questions on this?

786
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
Any questions on this?
 

787
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,710
Any questions on this?
>> Yes. The relationship between north and

788
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
>> Yes. The relationship between north and
 

789
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,669
>> Yes. The relationship between north and
south for each nodes are the same. I

790
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
south for each nodes are the same. I
 

791
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,310
south for each nodes are the same. I
mean this is north and south the same as

792
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,320
mean this is north and south the same as
 

793
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,909
mean this is north and south the same as
north and south here.

794
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
north and south here.
 

795
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,630
north and south here.
>> Excellent question. So uh let me zoom

796
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
>> Excellent question. So uh let me zoom
 

797
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,830
>> Excellent question. So uh let me zoom
out here because I' I've captured this.

798
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
out here because I' I've captured this.
 

799
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,070
out here because I' I've captured this.
Uh is there's a finite set of labels in

800
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
Uh is there's a finite set of labels in
 

801
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,070
Uh is there's a finite set of labels in
this graph?

802
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
this graph?
 

803
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,230
this graph?
Right? There's north, south, east, west,

804
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
Right? There's north, south, east, west,
 

805
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,669
Right? There's north, south, east, west,
northeast, southeast, northwest,

806
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
northeast, southeast, northwest,
 

807
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,110
northeast, southeast, northwest,
southwest. And this label is the same.

808
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
southwest. And this label is the same.
 

809
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,190
southwest. And this label is the same.
So this edge south label and this edge

810
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,200
So this edge south label and this edge
 

811
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,830
So this edge south label and this edge
north label is the same label as this

812
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
north label is the same label as this
 

813
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,070
north label is the same label as this
one. So in that sense the labels are

814
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
one. So in that sense the labels are
 

815
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,270
one. So in that sense the labels are
capturing the nature of that

816
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
capturing the nature of that
 

817
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,990
capturing the nature of that
relationship and there's a finite set of

818
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
relationship and there's a finite set of
 

819
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,350
relationship and there's a finite set of
them. So it's the same.

820
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
them. So it's the same.
 

821
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,270
them. So it's the same.
Okay, does that answer your question?

822
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,280
Okay, does that answer your question?
 

823
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,110
Okay, does that answer your question?
Okay, good. So now you have the idea

824
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
Okay, good. So now you have the idea
 

825
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,549
Okay, good. So now you have the idea
that you have uh these neighbors and we

826
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
that you have uh these neighbors and we
 

827
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,990
that you have uh these neighbors and we
have to make note of something else

828
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
have to make note of something else
 

829
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,830
have to make note of something else
which is that you always have a special

830
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:09,840
which is that you always have a special
 

831
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,230
which is that you always have a special
relationship to self

832
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
relationship to self
 

833
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,909
relationship to self
right in a con you need to use the

834
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919
right in a con you need to use the
 

835
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,909
right in a con you need to use the
information here but you can just say

836
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
information here but you can just say
 

837
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,870
information here but you can just say
graphs have a self they know where they

838
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
graphs have a self they know where they
 

839
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,190
graphs have a self they know where they
what they themselves are at a particular

840
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
what they themselves are at a particular
 

841
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,510
what they themselves are at a particular
node.

842
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
node.
 

843
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,510
node.
Is that clear?

844
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
Is that clear?
 

845
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,390
Is that clear?
Okay. So now what we're going to do is

846
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
Okay. So now what we're going to do is
 

847
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,549
Okay. So now what we're going to do is
we're going to just look at our picture

848
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:30,559
we're going to just look at our picture
 

849
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,870
we're going to just look at our picture
from before of

850
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
from before of
 

851
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,950
from before of
how we do a con a 3x3 con.

852
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:38,960
how we do a con a 3x3 con.
 

853
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,390
how we do a con a 3x3 con.
So everyone remember this picture from

854
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
So everyone remember this picture from
 

855
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,190
So everyone remember this picture from
before for a 3x3 con where we thought

856
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
before for a 3x3 con where we thought
 

857
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,710
before for a 3x3 con where we thought
about there being weight matrices

858
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
about there being weight matrices
 

859
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,549
about there being weight matrices
associated with every position in the

860
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
associated with every position in the
 

861
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,630
associated with every position in the
3x3 grid and you had a bias and you

862
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
3x3 grid and you had a bias and you
 

863
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,190
3x3 grid and you had a bias and you
computed the output for this particular

864
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
computed the output for this particular
 

865
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,630
computed the output for this particular
position by taking a sum of information

866
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
position by taking a sum of information
 

867
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,230
position by taking a sum of information
from neighboring pixels as well as this

868
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
from neighboring pixels as well as this
 

869
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,070
from neighboring pixels as well as this
pixel itself.

870
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
pixel itself.
 

871
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,750
pixel itself.
Okay. Now we can think of that from a

872
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
Okay. Now we can think of that from a
 

873
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,350
Okay. Now we can think of that from a
point of view of where the information

874
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
point of view of where the information
 

875
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,310
point of view of where the information
is flowing on a graph. We can think of

876
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
is flowing on a graph. We can think of
 

877
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,350
is flowing on a graph. We can think of
it as a particular node receives

878
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
it as a particular node receives
 

879
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,950
it as a particular node receives
messages from its neighbors

880
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
messages from its neighbors
 

881
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,870
messages from its neighbors
each of whom has their own labeled edge

882
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
each of whom has their own labeled edge
 

883
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,150
each of whom has their own labeled edge
to me. So I'm going to take the

884
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:20,160
to me. So I'm going to take the
 

885
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,830
to me. So I'm going to take the
perspective of me being the node the

886
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
perspective of me being the node the
 

887
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,430
perspective of me being the node the
center.

888
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
center.
 

889
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,110
center.
So I get information from all these

890
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
So I get information from all these
 

891
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,270
So I get information from all these
different edges. And so I see this has

892
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,280
different edges. And so I see this has
 

893
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,830
different edges. And so I see this has
come to me on an edge labeled north.

894
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
come to me on an edge labeled north.
 

895
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,390
come to me on an edge labeled north.
So I'll multiply it by the matrix W N.

896
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,400
So I'll multiply it by the matrix W N.
 

897
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,190
So I'll multiply it by the matrix W N.
This information has come for me from an

898
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
This information has come for me from an
 

899
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,149
This information has come for me from an
an edge labeled south. So I'm going to

900
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
an edge labeled south. So I'm going to
 

901
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,390
an edge labeled south. So I'm going to
multiply that information by a weight

902
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
multiply that information by a weight
 

903
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,909
multiply that information by a weight
south.

904
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
south.
 

905
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,230
south.
Everyone see this? And I do this and I

906
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:48,240
Everyone see this? And I do this and I
 

907
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,230
Everyone see this? And I do this and I
add them all up and I take my own

908
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
add them all up and I take my own
 

909
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,430
add them all up and I take my own
information that I have from the last

910
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
information that I have from the last
 

911
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,830
information that I have from the last
layer and I multiply it by something

912
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
layer and I multiply it by something
 

913
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,270
layer and I multiply it by something
specific. the weight for me. Add that up

914
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
specific. the weight for me. Add that up
 

915
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,270
specific. the weight for me. Add that up
and then I add a bias.

916
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280

 

917
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,830

Okay, so I'll pause here uh for a

918
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840
Okay, so I'll pause here uh for a
 

919
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,990
Okay, so I'll pause here uh for a
minute.

920
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,000
minute.
 

921
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,270
minute.
Does everyone see how this is exactly

922
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,280
Does everyone see how this is exactly
 

923
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,590
Does everyone see how this is exactly
what's happening here? Except all we've

924
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
what's happening here? Except all we've
 

925
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,750
what's happening here? Except all we've
done is we've turned it from thinking of

926
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,760
done is we've turned it from thinking of
 

927
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,870
done is we've turned it from thinking of
it as a convolution acting on a array to

928
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
it as a convolution acting on a array to
 

929
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,990
it as a convolution acting on a array to
messages coming on a graph.

930
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
messages coming on a graph.
 

931
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,669
messages coming on a graph.
But it's the same story. Nothing has

932
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679
But it's the same story. Nothing has
 

933
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,830
But it's the same story. Nothing has
changed. We've just translated to graph

934
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:29,840
changed. We've just translated to graph
 

935
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,830
changed. We've just translated to graph
language.

936
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:31,840
language.
 

937
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,909
language.
So any questions here.

938
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919

 

939
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,390

Okay.

940
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:42,400

 

941
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,590

So now if there's no questions we can

942
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
So now if there's no questions we can
 

943
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,029
So now if there's no questions we can
say okay let's like make some

944
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
say okay let's like make some
 

945
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,789
say okay let's like make some
observations here.

946
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799

 

947
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,590

In this view,

948
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600
In this view,
 

949
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,549
In this view,
we have implicitly

950
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559
we have implicitly
 

951
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,990
we have implicitly
same padding and zero padding. Whereas

952
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,000
same padding and zero padding. Whereas
 

953
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,669
same padding and zero padding. Whereas
for a con, we had this question of where

954
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:01,679
for a con, we had this question of where
 

955
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,110
for a con, we had this question of where
was the con fit?

956
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
was the con fit?
 

957
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,950
was the con fit?
Everyone see that? So, let me explain

958
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
Everyone see that? So, let me explain
 

959
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,909
Everyone see that? So, let me explain
what I mean by that.

960
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:09,919
what I mean by that.
 

961
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,710
what I mean by that.
In the picture of a con, we ask the

962
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
In the picture of a con, we ask the
 

963
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,990
In the picture of a con, we ask the
question, well, I don't know how to get

964
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,000
question, well, I don't know how to get
 

965
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,909
question, well, I don't know how to get
an output for this for a 3x3 con

966
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
an output for this for a 3x3 con
 

967
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,470
an output for this for a 3x3 con
necessarily because I can't fit a 3x3

968
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
necessarily because I can't fit a 3x3
 

969
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,710
necessarily because I can't fit a 3x3
filter. I'll have an out of memory

970
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
filter. I'll have an out of memory
 

971
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,390
filter. I'll have an out of memory
error. But in this picture, I will just

972
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,400
error. But in this picture, I will just
 

973
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,350
error. But in this picture, I will just
receive messages from some edges but not

974
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
receive messages from some edges but not
 

975
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,590
receive messages from some edges but not
from others. So if I follow this

976
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
from others. So if I follow this
 

977
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,270
from others. So if I follow this
procedure, I'll still just multiply

978
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280
procedure, I'll still just multiply
 

979
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,830
procedure, I'll still just multiply
everything out, add them up, and I'll

980
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
everything out, add them up, and I'll
 

981
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,070
everything out, add them up, and I'll
have an answer.

982
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
have an answer.
 

983
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,630
have an answer.
But what that corresponds to is the

984
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,640
But what that corresponds to is the
 

985
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,470
But what that corresponds to is the
missing information that I don't have by

986
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
missing information that I don't have by
 

987
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,870
missing information that I don't have by
multiplying by zeros. So it's like a

988
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
multiplying by zeros. So it's like a
 

989
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,270
multiplying by zeros. So it's like a
zero pad.

990
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
zero pad.
 

991
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,470
zero pad.
And in this picture, no node says,

992
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:48,480
And in this picture, no node says,
 

993
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,510
And in this picture, no node says,
"Sorry, I have nothing. I'm out."

994
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:51,520
"Sorry, I have nothing. I'm out."
 

995
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,070
"Sorry, I have nothing. I'm out."
So it's always same padding.

996
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
So it's always same padding.
 

997
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,390
So it's always same padding.
As I apply this kind of processing, I

998
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
As I apply this kind of processing, I
 

999
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,950
As I apply this kind of processing, I
always get the same nodes back. No new

1000
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:58,960
always get the same nodes back. No new
 

1001
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,149
always get the same nodes back. No new
nodes are added, no nodes are deleted in

1002
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
nodes are added, no nodes are deleted in
 

1003
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,510
nodes are added, no nodes are deleted in
this picture.

1004
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520

 

1005
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,230

Questions on that?

1006
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,240
Questions on that?
 

1007
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,789
Questions on that?
Yes,

1008
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
Yes,
 

1009
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,470
Yes,

convolution we think of there just being

1012
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,000
convolution we think of there just being
 

1013
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,029
convolution we think of there just being
like one unified bias. In this case,

1014
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
like one unified bias. In this case,
 

1015
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,510
like one unified bias. In this case,
would we still like technically have

1016
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
would we still like technically have
 

1017
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,430
would we still like technically have
unified bias or do we just functionally

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,440
unified bias or do we just functionally
 

1019
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,310
unified bias or do we just functionally
have one because all of the connections

00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
have one because all of the connections
 

1021
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,230
have one because all of the connections
have their own biases that just add up

have their own biases that just add up
 

1023
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,510
have their own biases that just add up
together.

1024
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,520
together.
 

1025
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,070
together.
>> Okay, excellent point. So the way I

1026
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
>> Okay, excellent point. So the way I
 

1027
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,430
>> Okay, excellent point. So the way I
described it, so let me you're asking

1028
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:29,440
described it, so let me you're asking
 

1029
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,870
described it, so let me you're asking
about the biases. So let me explain the

1030
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:30,880
about the biases. So let me explain the
 

1031
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,310
about the biases. So let me explain the
biases as well as make note of another

1032
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
biases as well as make note of another
 

1033
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,669
biases as well as make note of another
point.

1034
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
point.
 

1035
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,430
point.
The way I described this is I said you

1036
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,440
The way I described this is I said you
 

1037
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,350
The way I described this is I said you
do all these multiplications add them up

1038
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:37,360
do all these multiplications add them up
 

1039
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,029
do all these multiplications add them up
and then finally you add a bias.

1040
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
and then finally you add a bias.
 

1041
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,669
and then finally you add a bias.
Okay. But implicit in this story is

1042
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:43,679
Okay. But implicit in this story is
 

1043
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,350
Okay. But implicit in this story is
weight sharing. So let me make a note of

1044
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,360
weight sharing. So let me make a note of
 

1045
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,190
weight sharing. So let me make a note of
that explicitly.

1046
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
that explicitly.
 

1047
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,789
that explicitly.
Make another note.

1048
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:50,799

 

1049
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,830

Weight sharing

1050
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840

 

1051
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,990

across nodes.

1052
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000

 

1053
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,990

So just as we said in the connet you

1054
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
So just as we said in the connet you
 

1055
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,510
So just as we said in the connet you
could imagine a connet where you do

1056
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520
could imagine a connet where you do
 

1057
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,870
could imagine a connet where you do
different convolutions at different

1058
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:06,880
different convolutions at different
 

1059
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,789
different convolutions at different
places. In fact we had on the on the

1060
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:08,799
places. In fact we had on the on the
 

1061
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,630
places. In fact we had on the on the
discussion for you to see right you can

1062
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:10,640
discussion for you to see right you can
 

1063
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,789
discussion for you to see right you can
still do that but we said in practice we

1064
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
still do that but we said in practice we
 

1065
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,350
still do that but we said in practice we
share. Why? Because we want to say that

1066
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
share. Why? Because we want to say that
 

1067
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,870
share. Why? Because we want to say that
what we learned here is good over here

1068
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880
what we learned here is good over here
 

1069
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,830
what we learned here is good over here
too. We do the same thing in a graph

1070
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:19,840
too. We do the same thing in a graph
 

1071
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,190
too. We do the same thing in a graph
except the weight sharing which was

1072
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
except the weight sharing which was
 

1073
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,710
except the weight sharing which was
weight sharing over pixels in a CNN

1074
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
weight sharing over pixels in a CNN
 

1075
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,190
weight sharing over pixels in a CNN
becomes weight sharing over nodes in a

1076
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,200
becomes weight sharing over nodes in a
 

1077
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,269
becomes weight sharing over nodes in a
graph neural net. But it's the same

1078
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,279
graph neural net. But it's the same
 

1079
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,390
graph neural net. But it's the same
story.

1080
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:32,400

 

1081
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,149

Okay. So everyone sees uh these two

1082
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
Okay. So everyone sees uh these two
 

1083
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,190
Okay. So everyone sees uh these two
points hopefully understands them.

1084
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200

 

1085
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,350

Second is in our description of connets

1086
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:45,360
Second is in our description of connets
 

1087
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,230
Second is in our description of connets
we also had one by one coms and one by

1088
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,240
we also had one by one coms and one by
 

1089
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,310
we also had one by one coms and one by
one conss if you remember just acted on

1090
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320
one conss if you remember just acted on
 

1091
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,029
one conss if you remember just acted on
the information in a particular pixel

1092
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
the information in a particular pixel
 

1093
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,430
the information in a particular pixel
and that just carries over here too.

1094
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
and that just carries over here too.
 

1095
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,430
and that just carries over here too.
Okay, we can still have operations. We

1096
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
Okay, we can still have operations. We
 

1097
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,789
Okay, we can still have operations. We
want to do this local to a particular

1098
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
want to do this local to a particular
 

1099
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,149
want to do this local to a particular
node. Just look at the information in

1100
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
node. Just look at the information in
 

1101
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,950
node. Just look at the information in
this node does some operation on it. A

1102
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
this node does some operation on it. A
 

1103
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,110
this node does some operation on it. A
one by one con, you can make it an MLP

1104
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,120
one by one con, you can make it an MLP
 

1105
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,430
one by one con, you can make it an MLP
like all that can still happen just as

1106
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
like all that can still happen just as
 

1107
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,510
like all that can still happen just as
we did in the blocks that we had. For

1108
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
we did in the blocks that we had. For
 

1109
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,549
we did in the blocks that we had. For
example, last time we talked about

1110
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
example, last time we talked about
 

1111
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,630
example, last time we talked about
resonant blocks, right? Remember in the

1112
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
resonant blocks, right? Remember in the
 

1113
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,149
resonant blocks, right? Remember in the
context we said there was some kind of

1114
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:16,159
context we said there was some kind of
 

1115
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,269
context we said there was some kind of
convolution and then there was a we'll

1116
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
convolution and then there was a we'll
 

1117
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,149
convolution and then there was a we'll
talk about other layers like

1118
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
talk about other layers like
 

1119
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,149
talk about other layers like
normalization and then there was a one

1120
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:22,159
normalization and then there was a one
 

1121
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,230
normalization and then there was a one
by one followed by nonlinearity followed

1122
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
by one followed by nonlinearity followed
 

1123
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,190
by one followed by nonlinearity followed
by one by one. So all that kind of story

1124
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
by one by one. So all that kind of story
 

1125
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,590
by one by one. So all that kind of story
just still works here. That's this

1126
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,600
just still works here. That's this
 

1127
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,789
just still works here. That's this
meaning of the one by ones.

1128
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
meaning of the one by ones.
 

1129
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,070
meaning of the one by ones.
So and just as in a connet

1130
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
So and just as in a connet
 

1131
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,269
So and just as in a connet
the matrices wi and biases B are

1132
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:41,279
the matrices wi and biases B are
 

1133
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,950
the matrices wi and biases B are
specific to a particular layer of

1134
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
specific to a particular layer of
 

1135
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,110
specific to a particular layer of
processing. So in a connet we do

1136
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
processing. So in a connet we do
 

1137
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,230
processing. So in a connet we do
different cons at different blocks. We

1138
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,240
different cons at different blocks. We
 

1139
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,470
different cons at different blocks. We
can do the same thing here

1140
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
can do the same thing here
 

1141
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,029
can do the same thing here
in a graph neural net.

1142
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,039
in a graph neural net.
 

1143
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,310
in a graph neural net.
So here the important thing is we

1144
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:56,320
So here the important thing is we
 

1145
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,350
So here the important thing is we
haven't changed anything. It's the same

1146
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
haven't changed anything. It's the same
 

1147
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,789
haven't changed anything. It's the same
as it was in a connet. We're just

1148
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:00,799
as it was in a connet. We're just
 

1149
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,230
as it was in a connet. We're just
interpreting it in graph language and

1150
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
interpreting it in graph language and
 

1151
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,750
interpreting it in graph language and
seeing that everything just carries

1152
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:03,760
seeing that everything just carries
 

1153
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,630
seeing that everything just carries
over.

1154
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
over.
 

1155
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,430
over.
>> Yes.

1156
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
>> Yes.
 

1157
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,830
>> Yes.
>> Um if we're using matrices for like the

1158
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:07,840
>> Um if we're using matrices for like the
 

1159
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,510
>> Um if we're using matrices for like the
gra does that imply that there's like

1160
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,520
gra does that imply that there's like
 

1161
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,230
gra does that imply that there's like
channels of the graph as well.

1162
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,240
channels of the graph as well.
 

1163
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,590
channels of the graph as well.
>> Excellent question. The question about

1164
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:13,600
>> Excellent question. The question about
 

1165
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,789
>> Excellent question. The question about
channels. So just as we had in a CNN in

1166
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
channels. So just as we had in a CNN in
 

1167
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,269
channels. So just as we had in a CNN in
a CNN we said what's an image? An image

1168
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:19,279
a CNN we said what's an image? An image
 

1169
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,230
a CNN we said what's an image? An image
is a rectangular array of pixels filled

1170
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,240
is a rectangular array of pixels filled
 

1171
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,390
is a rectangular array of pixels filled
with vectors. That's what we said was an

1172
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
with vectors. That's what we said was an
 

1173
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,549
with vectors. That's what we said was an
image. So here in a graph neural net,

1174
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:26,559
image. So here in a graph neural net,
 

1175
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,990
image. So here in a graph neural net,
we'll and those vectors are the same

1176
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
we'll and those vectors are the same
 

1177
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,430
we'll and those vectors are the same
size. In a graph neural net, we'll say

1178
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,440
size. In a graph neural net, we'll say
 

1179
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,430
size. In a graph neural net, we'll say
what's a graph problem? It's a graph

1180
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,440
what's a graph problem? It's a graph
 

1181
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,549
what's a graph problem? It's a graph
with in this particular case edges

1182
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
with in this particular case edges
 

1183
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,830
with in this particular case edges
labeled with one of some finite set

1184
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:41,840
labeled with one of some finite set
 

1185
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,710
labeled with one of some finite set
and inside every node of the graph is a

1186
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
and inside every node of the graph is a
 

1187
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,950
and inside every node of the graph is a
vector of the same dimension. That's how

1188
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:46,960
vector of the same dimension. That's how
 

1189
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,549
vector of the same dimension. That's how
the whatever your input is, you have to

1190
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:48,559
the whatever your input is, you have to
 

1191
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,669
the whatever your input is, you have to
turn it into this for me to start

1192
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
turn it into this for me to start
 

1193
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,390
turn it into this for me to start
working. The same thing for a CNN.

1194
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400

 

1195
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,990

Okay. So

1196
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,000
Okay. So
 

1197
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,110
Okay. So
what I what I said here is that look

1198
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
what I what I said here is that look
 

1199
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,070
what I what I said here is that look
from this simple picture

1200
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,080
from this simple picture
 

1201
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,789
from this simple picture
doing no work at all.

1202
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
doing no work at all.
 

1203
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,630
doing no work at all.
We have an immediate recipe to

1204
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:08,640
We have an immediate recipe to
 

1205
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,110
We have an immediate recipe to
generalize CNN's to as long as we have

1206
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,120
generalize CNN's to as long as we have
 

1207
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,669
generalize CNN's to as long as we have
the following properties. We must have a

1208
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
the following properties. We must have a
 

1209
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,669
the following properties. We must have a
directed graph

1210
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:15,679
directed graph
 

1211
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,390
directed graph
and every edge has to be labeled from a

1212
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:18,400
and every edge has to be labeled from a
 

1213
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,190
and every edge has to be labeled from a
discrete finite set. Then with every

1214
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,200
discrete finite set. Then with every
 

1215
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,789
discrete finite set. Then with every
element of that finite set, we can

1216
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:22,799
element of that finite set, we can
 

1217
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,190
element of that finite set, we can
associate a weight matrix

1218
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
associate a weight matrix
 

1219
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,510
associate a weight matrix
and then we can follow this recipe.

1220
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520

 

1221
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,390

Does everyone see that? So this is like

1222
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:32,400
Does everyone see that? So this is like
 

1223
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,830
Does everyone see that? So this is like
simply saying we look at a a CNN and we

1224
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
simply saying we look at a a CNN and we
 

1225
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,750
simply saying we look at a a CNN and we
say let's think about it as those on a

1226
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760
say let's think about it as those on a
 

1227
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,950
say let's think about it as those on a
graph. What do we know how to do? We

1228
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:40,960
graph. What do we know how to do? We
 

1229
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,110
graph. What do we know how to do? We
know how to do this.

1230
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,120
know how to do this.
 

1231
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,830
know how to do this.
Nothing new is required to do this. So

1232
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:47,840
Nothing new is required to do this. So
 

1233
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,390
Nothing new is required to do this. So
now we ask ourselves

1234
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,400
now we ask ourselves
 

1235
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,430
now we ask ourselves
what kind of stuff do we get that

1236
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
what kind of stuff do we get that
 

1237
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,909
what kind of stuff do we get that
generalizes immediately like there's no

1238
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:55,919
generalizes immediately like there's no
 

1239
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,630
generalizes immediately like there's no
work required.

1240
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:58,640
work required.
 

1241
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,830
work required.
So weight sharing nodes do the same

1242
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:01,840
So weight sharing nodes do the same
 

1243
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:09,430
So weight sharing nodes do the same
things again no work 3x3 cons fine

1244
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
things again no work 3x3 cons fine
 

1245
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,350
things again no work 3x3 cons fine
matrices for edge labels we have

1246
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,360
matrices for edge labels we have
 

1247
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,909
matrices for edge labels we have
the idea of additional channels fine we

1248
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:15,919
the idea of additional channels fine we
 

1249
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,269
the idea of additional channels fine we
can do a con that creates more channels

1250
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:17,279
can do a con that creates more channels
 

1251
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,710
can do a con that creates more channels
at another layer no problem

1252
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:20,720
at another layer no problem
 

1253
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,430
at another layer no problem
residual connections no problem we can

1254
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
residual connections no problem we can
 

1255
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,710
residual connections no problem we can
still add things together

1256
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:26,720
still add things together
 

1257
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,710
still add things together
dropout for MLPS

1258
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:28,720
dropout for MLPS
 

1259
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,190
dropout for MLPS
No problem. Stocastic depth

1260
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,200
No problem. Stocastic depth

No problem. Stocastic depth
regularization no problem. Nothing is

00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
it just works.
 

1265
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,029
it just works.
Does it? Okay. This is is it good to

Does it? Okay. This is is it good to
 

1267

Does it? Okay. This is is it good to
pause here? Any questions on this? When

1268
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720
pause here? Any questions on this? When
 

1269
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,389
pause here? Any questions on this? When
I say just works, it means from the

00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:42,399
I say just works, it means from the
 

1271
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,789
I say just works, it means from the
graph story we've told

00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,799
graph story we've told
 

1273
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,430
graph story we've told
you do exactly the same thing and you

1274
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:47,440
you do exactly the same thing and you
 

1275
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,350
you do exactly the same thing and you
can do it on a graph. No thought is

1276
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,360
can do it on a graph. No thought is
 

1277
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,029
can do it on a graph. No thought is

00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:53,039

 

1279
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,909

Any questions on these?

1280
00:28:57,909 --> 00:28:57,919

 

1281
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,549

Yes.

1282
00:28:58,549 --> 00:28:58,559
Yes.
 

1283
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,750
Yes.
>> I think I'm just a little confused.

1284
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760
>> I think I'm just a little confused.
 

1285
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,750
>> I think I'm just a little confused.
Could you like for example like show how

1286
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:01,760
Could you like for example like show how
 

1287
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,029
Could you like for example like show how
you would like drop out on a graph?

1288
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039
you would like drop out on a graph?
 

1289
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,230
you would like drop out on a graph?
>> Ah, excellent. So I didn't say drop out

1290
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,240
>> Ah, excellent. So I didn't say drop out
 

1291
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,190
>> Ah, excellent. So I didn't say drop out
on a graph. I said drop out for MLPS. So

1292
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
on a graph. I said drop out for MLPS. So
 

1293
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,789
on a graph. I said drop out for MLPS. So
remember we said when do you use dropout

1294
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
remember we said when do you use dropout
 

1295
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,110
remember we said when do you use dropout
in the CNN? You use them on the MLPS.

1296
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,120
in the CNN? You use them on the MLPS.
 

1297
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,549
in the CNN? You use them on the MLPS.
We said we don't use dropout on the

1298
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:18,559
We said we don't use dropout on the
 

1299
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,710
We said we don't use dropout on the
cons.

1300
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:20,720
cons.
 

1301
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,149
cons.
So dropout for the MLPS those are like

1302
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:24,159
So dropout for the MLPS those are like
 

1303
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,549
So dropout for the MLPS those are like
you still have MLPS here. and they they

1304
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:26,559
you still have MLPS here. and they they
 

1305
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,830
you still have MLPS here. and they they
don't they don't even care that there's

1306
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,840
don't they don't even care that there's
 

1307
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,310
don't they don't even care that there's
a graph. They just sit inside one node.

1308
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,320

 

1309
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,630

Okay. So from that point of view, it

1310
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:34,640
Okay. So from that point of view, it
 

1311
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,389
Okay. So from that point of view, it
doesn't even the dropout for MLPS

1312
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:36,399
doesn't even the dropout for MLPS
 

1313
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,830
doesn't even the dropout for MLPS
doesn't even see the graph.

1314
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,840
doesn't even see the graph.
 

1315
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,190
doesn't even see the graph.
>> Yeah.

1316
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
>> Yeah.
 

1317
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,590
>> Yeah.
>> Could you like illustrate real quick

1318
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
>> Could you like illustrate real quick
 

1319
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,590

what are the weights that are associated

1320
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,600
what are the weights that are associated
 

1321
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,070
what are the weights that are associated
with the graph again? Are they the edges

1322
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
with the graph again? Are they the edges
 

1323
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,110
with the graph again? Are they the edges
or what?

1324
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,120
or what?
 

1325
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,430
or what?
>> Okay. Excellent question. When I use the

1326
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,440
>> Okay. Excellent question. When I use the
 

1327
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,430
>> Okay. Excellent question. When I use the
word weight, I'm going to mean a

1328
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,440
word weight, I'm going to mean a
 

1329
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,909
word weight, I'm going to mean a
learnable parameter.

1330
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
learnable parameter.
 

1331
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,029
learnable parameter.
Okay, of our neural net. The neural net

1332
00:29:59,029 --> 00:29:59,039
Okay, of our neural net. The neural net
 

1333
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,669
Okay, of our neural net. The neural net
is something that we design. We would

1334
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
is something that we design. We would
 

1335
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,830
is something that we design. We would
like to do the processing in a way that

1336
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:03,840
like to do the processing in a way that
 

1337
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,230
like to do the processing in a way that
respects the graph's topology. That's

1338
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,240
respects the graph's topology. That's
 

1339
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,830
respects the graph's topology. That's
why we're doing a graph neural net

1340
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:07,840
why we're doing a graph neural net
 

1341
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,710
why we're doing a graph neural net
because we saw this is useful for a CNN

1342
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:10,720
because we saw this is useful for a CNN
 

1343
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,710
because we saw this is useful for a CNN
to respect the images topology. So, we

1344
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:12,720
to respect the images topology. So, we
 

1345
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,909
to respect the images topology. So, we
want to kind of carry that same

1346
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:13,919
want to kind of carry that same
 

1347
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,149
want to kind of carry that same
principle over.

1348
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:16,159
principle over.
 

1349
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,830
principle over.
There are no weights associated with the

1350
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
There are no weights associated with the
 

1351
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,750
There are no weights associated with the
graph.

1352
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:19,760
graph.
 

1353
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,389
graph.
In this story, all we have is edges with

1354
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:22,399
In this story, all we have is edges with
 

1355
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,549
In this story, all we have is edges with
labels. There's no weights. there are

1356
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:24,559
labels. There's no weights. there are
 

1357
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,950
labels. There's no weights. there are
labels and those labels come from a

1358
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:26,960
labels and those labels come from a
 

1359
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,430
labels and those labels come from a
discrete finite set.

1360
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,440
discrete finite set.
 

1361
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,950
discrete finite set.
Okay, so there are no weights associated

1362
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
Okay, so there are no weights associated
 

1363
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,310
Okay, so there are no weights associated
with the graph. There are weights

1364
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,320
with the graph. There are weights
 

1365
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,029
with the graph. There are weights
associated with the graph neural net and

1366
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:35,039
associated with the graph neural net and
 

1367
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,630
associated with the graph neural net and
those weights associated with the graph

1368
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:36,640
those weights associated with the graph
 

1369
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,149
those weights associated with the graph
neural net for the thing that

1370
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
neural net for the thing that
 

1371
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,590
neural net for the thing that
corresponds to a 3x3 conf. Those weights

1372
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
corresponds to a 3x3 conf. Those weights
 

1373
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,669
corresponds to a 3x3 conf. Those weights
are associated with the edge labels.

1374
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:45,679
are associated with the edge labels.
 

1375
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,310
are associated with the edge labels.
Okay, that's what we have here.

1376
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320

 

1377
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,029

>> Yes. Um, I think I get the difference

1378
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:55,039
>> Yes. Um, I think I get the difference
 

1379
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,909
>> Yes. Um, I think I get the difference
between like the CNN and the CNN, but

1380
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:57,919
between like the CNN and the CNN, but
 

1381
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,389
between like the CNN and the CNN, but
I'm not sure about the difference on the

1382
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:00,399
I'm not sure about the difference on the
 

1383
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,310
I'm not sure about the difference on the
coding part like should we just create

1384
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:04,320
coding part like should we just create
 

1385
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,269
coding part like should we just create
classes

1386
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
classes
 

1387
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,389
classes
>> for what? Sorry.

1388
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:08,399
>> for what? Sorry.
 

1389
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,950
>> for what? Sorry.
>> Like how how different is it when you

1390
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:10,960
>> Like how how different is it when you
 

1391
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,510
>> Like how how different is it when you
code it?

1392
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:11,520
code it?
 

1393
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,990
code it?
>> Ah, excellent question. So, okay, so

1394
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,000
>> Ah, excellent question. So, okay, so
 

1395
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,430
>> Ah, excellent question. So, okay, so
that's a really really good question.

1396
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,440
that's a really really good question.
 

1397
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,190
that's a really really good question.
So, the question was, okay, we

1398
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,200
So, the question was, okay, we
 

1399
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,510
So, the question was, okay, we
understand the story conceptually, but

1400
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:19,520
understand the story conceptually, but
 

1401
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,789
understand the story conceptually, but
what do you do when you're working with

1402
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:20,799
what do you do when you're working with
 

1403
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,269
what do you do when you're working with
code? Right? because you can't just say

1404
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:23,279
code? Right? because you can't just say
 

1405
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,909
code? Right? because you can't just say
well look I know that this particular

1406
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:25,919
well look I know that this particular
 

1407
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,710
well look I know that this particular
case is exactly like a CNN conceptually

1408
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:28,720
case is exactly like a CNN conceptually
 

1409
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,310
case is exactly like a CNN conceptually
you can't call the con class and have it

1410
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:32,320
you can't call the con class and have it
 

1411
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,710
you can't call the con class and have it
work because it expects arrays and here

1412
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
work because it expects arrays and here
 

1413
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,630
work because it expects arrays and here
we don't have arrays we have graphs this

1414
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640
we don't have arrays we have graphs this
 

1415
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,269
we don't have arrays we have graphs this
is why on the first page I said use

1416
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
is why on the first page I said use
 

1417
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,509
is why on the first page I said use
these libraries

1418
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:41,519
these libraries
 

1419
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,230
these libraries
okay

1420
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,240

 

1421
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,110

so uh pytorch geometric for example will

1422
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:49,120
so uh pytorch geometric for example will
 

1423
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,909
so uh pytorch geometric for example will
give you classes that will deal with all

1424
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:51,919
give you classes that will deal with all
 

1425
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,830
give you classes that will deal with all
these these things for you. Okay? And

1426
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:53,840
these these things for you. Okay? And
 

1427
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,830
these these things for you. Okay? And
you can reuse those. So this is an

1428
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:55,840
you can reuse those. So this is an
 

1429
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,269
you can reuse those. So this is an
excellent point to make a note of

1430
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:57,279
excellent point to make a note of
 

1431
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,789
excellent point to make a note of
something that's is practically

1432
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:58,799
something that's is practically
 

1433
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,110
something that's is practically
significant. So in graphs

1434
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
significant. So in graphs
 

1435
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,870
significant. So in graphs
we have a graph and we can take a local

1436
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:04,880
we have a graph and we can take a local
 

1437
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,590
we have a graph and we can take a local
view. But in images you have a very

1438
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:07,600
view. But in images you have a very
 

1439
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,630
view. But in images you have a very
rigid and

1440
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:10,640
rigid and
 

1441
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,149
rigid and
rectangular structure and computers like

1442
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:14,159
rectangular structure and computers like
 

1443
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,149
rectangular structure and computers like
rectangular structures because they map

1444
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:16,159
rectangular structures because they map
 

1445
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,470
rectangular structures because they map
to memory arrays nicely and here it's

1446
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
to memory arrays nicely and here it's
 

1447
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,310
to memory arrays nicely and here it's
more free form. So there's a

1448
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,320
more free form. So there's a
 

1449
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,350
more free form. So there's a
computational hit you take by having to

1450
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:23,360
computational hit you take by having to
 

1451
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,470
computational hit you take by having to
have this flexibility and the libraries

1452
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:26,480
have this flexibility and the libraries
 

1453
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,630
have this flexibility and the libraries
work very hard into trying to get the

1454
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:28,640
work very hard into trying to get the
 

1455
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,830
work very hard into trying to get the
parallelisms to work when it can work

1456
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:31,840
parallelisms to work when it can work
 

1457
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,870
parallelisms to work when it can work
but you take a hit for doing it. Um but

1458
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:34,880
but you take a hit for doing it. Um but
 

1459
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,269
but you take a hit for doing it. Um but
the practical importance of graphs is so

1460
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:37,279
the practical importance of graphs is so
 

1461
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,350
the practical importance of graphs is so
high that it's worth people making those

1462
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
high that it's worth people making those
 

1463
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,190
high that it's worth people making those
libraries and making it efficient.

1464
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200
libraries and making it efficient.
 

1465
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,470
libraries and making it efficient.
And that's why we're not going to ask

1466
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:44,480
And that's why we're not going to ask
 

1467
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,549
And that's why we're not going to ask
you to code it up um yourself because it

1468
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:46,559
you to code it up um yourself because it
 

1469
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,389
you to code it up um yourself because it
is a lot more um like detailed keeping

1470
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:50,399
is a lot more um like detailed keeping
 

1471
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,950
is a lot more um like detailed keeping
track of edges and graphs and not much

1472
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:52,960
track of edges and graphs and not much
 

1473
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,950
track of edges and graphs and not much
learning bang for the buck in doing that

1474
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
learning bang for the buck in doing that
 

1475
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,110
learning bang for the buck in doing that
um in this class at least. I'm sure a

1476
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,120
um in this class at least. I'm sure a
 

1477
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,389
um in this class at least. I'm sure a
graph neural nets class would make you

1478
00:32:58,389 --> 00:32:58,399
graph neural nets class would make you
 

1479
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,310
graph neural nets class would make you
do it but this is not a graph neural

1480
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,320
do it but this is not a graph neural
 

1481
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,590
do it but this is not a graph neural
nets class.

1482
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:05,600

 

1483
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,950

So moving along. Okay. So now let's talk

1484
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:08,960
So moving along. Okay. So now let's talk
 

1485
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,269
So moving along. Okay. So now let's talk
about what stuff does not generalize.

1486
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:13,279
about what stuff does not generalize.
 

1487
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,029
about what stuff does not generalize.
So when you're can you just use this

1488
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:15,039
So when you're can you just use this
 

1489
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,630
So when you're can you just use this
exact kind of architecture as you did

1490
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:16,640
exact kind of architecture as you did
 

1491
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,789
exact kind of architecture as you did
before and the thing that doesn't

1492
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:18,799
before and the thing that doesn't
 

1493
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,149
before and the thing that doesn't
generalize that requires the most

1494
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:20,159
generalize that requires the most
 

1495
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,630
generalize that requires the most
thinking is

1496
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:22,640
thinking is
 

1497
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,269
thinking is
downsampling and pulling and relatedly

1498
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
downsampling and pulling and relatedly
 

1499
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,430
downsampling and pulling and relatedly
upsampling.

1500
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,440
upsampling.
 

1501
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,350
upsampling.
And the reason is if you think about a

1502
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
And the reason is if you think about a
 

1503
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,870
And the reason is if you think about a
graph right image it makes sense to say

1504
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:32,880
graph right image it makes sense to say
 

1505
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,789
graph right image it makes sense to say
give me that image at half the

1506
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:34,799
give me that image at half the
 

1507
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,310
give me that image at half the
resolution. That makes sense. We say

1508
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,320
resolution. That makes sense. We say
 

1509
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,070
resolution. That makes sense. We say
here is a graph of friends.

1510
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,080
here is a graph of friends.
 

1511
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,269
here is a graph of friends.
Give me this graph at half resolution.

1512
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
Give me this graph at half resolution.
 

1513
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,870
Give me this graph at half resolution.
Like what? Like what does that mean?

1514
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:48,880
Like what? Like what does that mean?
 

1515
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,269
Like what? Like what does that mean?
Right? It doesn't have an application

1516
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:51,279
Right? It doesn't have an application
 

1517
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,230
Right? It doesn't have an application
independent meaning you have to think

1518
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,240
independent meaning you have to think
 

1519
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,310
independent meaning you have to think
what am I trying to do? Why am I doing

1520
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:56,320
what am I trying to do? Why am I doing
 

1521
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,950
what am I trying to do? Why am I doing
this? What's going on? Right? What do I

1522
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:58,960
this? What's going on? Right? What do I
 

1523
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,909
this? What's going on? Right? What do I
want these new nodes to mean? Right? I

1524
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:01,919
want these new nodes to mean? Right? I
 

1525
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,590
want these new nodes to mean? Right? I
get a new graph. You can say give me a

1526
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
get a new graph. You can say give me a
 

1527
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,909
get a new graph. You can say give me a
graph with half as many nodes in it.

1528
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:05,919
graph with half as many nodes in it.
 

1529
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,830
graph with half as many nodes in it.
That makes sense as a question, but what

1530
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
That makes sense as a question, but what
 

1531
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,190
That makes sense as a question, but what
do you want from that half as many

1532
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
do you want from that half as many
 

1533
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,790
do you want from that half as many
nodes,

1534
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:10,800
nodes,
 

1535
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,510
nodes,
right? It's not as clear as throw away

1536
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:13,520
right? It's not as clear as throw away
 

1537
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,710
right? It's not as clear as throw away
every other pixel. Everyone see that? So

1538
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:16,720
every other pixel. Everyone see that? So
 

1539
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,909
every other pixel. Everyone see that? So
there's no clean way of generalizing

1540
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:19,919
there's no clean way of generalizing
 

1541
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:22,629
there's no clean way of generalizing
pooling and downsampling. And similarly

1542
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:22,639
pooling and downsampling. And similarly
 

1543
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,550
pooling and downsampling. And similarly
for upsampling for the same reason.

1544
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:26,560
for upsampling for the same reason.
 

1545
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,149
for upsampling for the same reason.
Any questions on that? So I just want to

1546
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
Any questions on that? So I just want to
 

1547
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,470
Any questions on that? So I just want to
flag that. So that's the part of the CNN

1548
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,480
flag that. So that's the part of the CNN
 

1549
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,589
flag that. So that's the part of the CNN
you can't just bring over.

1550
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:33,599
you can't just bring over.
 

1551
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,510
you can't just bring over.
You have to keep the same graph all the

1552
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520
You have to keep the same graph all the
 

1553
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,589
You have to keep the same graph all the
time for your processing. No going down.

1554
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:41,599
time for your processing. No going down.
 

1555
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,629
time for your processing. No going down.
Any questions on that part?

1556
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:44,639
Any questions on that part?
 

1557
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,069
Any questions on that part?
Okay. Next thing what needs discussion

1558
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:48,079
Okay. Next thing what needs discussion
 

1559
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,030
Okay. Next thing what needs discussion
is normalization

1560
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,040
is normalization
 

1561
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,069
is normalization
because the pictures we had in

1562
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:52,079
because the pictures we had in
 

1563
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,829
because the pictures we had in
normalization before were kind of image

1564
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
normalization before were kind of image
 

1565
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,270
normalization before were kind of image
tied. So we need to kind of think about

1566
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,280
tied. So we need to kind of think about
 

1567
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,869
tied. So we need to kind of think about
them a little bit um for the question.

1568
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
them a little bit um for the question.
 

1569
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,390
them a little bit um for the question.
It won't take long but we do have to

1570
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,400
It won't take long but we do have to
 

1571
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,190
It won't take long but we do have to
think about it.

1572
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
think about it.
 

1573
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,829
think about it.
Okay. So the big insight that we're

1574
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:03,839
Okay. So the big insight that we're
 

1575
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,510
Okay. So the big insight that we're
using throughout is the graph in a graph

1576
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,520
using throughout is the graph in a graph
 

1577
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,510
using throughout is the graph in a graph
neural net is playing the role of the

1578
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,520
neural net is playing the role of the
 

1579
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,950
neural net is playing the role of the
empty grid of pixels in a CNN. Okay, the

1580
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:12,960
empty grid of pixels in a CNN. Okay, the
 

1581
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,470
empty grid of pixels in a CNN. Okay, the
graph corresponds to the empty grid of

1582
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:14,480
graph corresponds to the empty grid of
 

1583
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,630
graph corresponds to the empty grid of
pixels. The input to a CNN is not an

1584
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
pixels. The input to a CNN is not an
 

1585
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,310
pixels. The input to a CNN is not an
empty grid of pixels but a grid of

1586
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:20,320
empty grid of pixels but a grid of
 

1587
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,390
empty grid of pixels but a grid of
pixels with values filled in. And same

1588
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,400
pixels with values filled in. And same
 

1589
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,670
pixels with values filled in. And same
thing for a GNN. The input is a graph

1590
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:25,680
thing for a GNN. The input is a graph
 

1591
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,230
thing for a GNN. The input is a graph
with vectors in it. And then we do

1592
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
with vectors in it. And then we do
 

1593
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,270
with vectors in it. And then we do
processing.

1594
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:31,280

 

1595
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,829

Okay, so now let's just talk about the

1596
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:33,839
Okay, so now let's just talk about the
 

1597
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,589
Okay, so now let's just talk about the
normalization part.

1598
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:39,599

 

1599
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,510

So before we had this these kind of

1600
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:43,520
So before we had this these kind of
 

1601
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,510
So before we had this these kind of
pictures

1602
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:45,520
pictures
 

1603
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,190
pictures
where we said we have an axis for

1604
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,200
where we said we have an axis for
 

1605
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,430
where we said we have an axis for
channels. We still have an axis for

1606
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:49,440
channels. We still have an axis for
 

1607
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,910
channels. We still have an axis for
channels. You could have batches. So we

1608
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:51,920
channels. You could have batches. So we
 

1609
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,550
channels. You could have batches. So we
could have an axis for batch

1610
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
could have an axis for batch
 

1611
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,589
could have an axis for batch
um except it's no longer this nice

1612
00:35:59,589 --> 00:35:59,599
um except it's no longer this nice
 

1613
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,230
um except it's no longer this nice
cubicle shape.

1614
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:02,240
cubicle shape.
 

1615
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,190
cubicle shape.
Why? Because in an image, we said we're

1616
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,200
Why? Because in an image, we said we're
 

1617
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,670
Why? Because in an image, we said we're
going to fix a resolution and all of our

1618
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:07,680
going to fix a resolution and all of our
 

1619
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,270
going to fix a resolution and all of our
images in the CNN are going to have the

1620
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,280
images in the CNN are going to have the
 

1621
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,750
images in the CNN are going to have the
same resolution. So our batch is going

1622
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:11,760
same resolution. So our batch is going
 

1623
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,270
same resolution. So our batch is going
to have the same size images. But for

1624
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,280
to have the same size images. But for
 

1625
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,910
to have the same size images. But for
graphs, if you're going to take many

1626
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:17,920
graphs, if you're going to take many
 

1627
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,310
graphs, if you're going to take many
graphs as your input to make a batch,

1628
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:22,320
graphs as your input to make a batch,
 

1629
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,990
graphs as your input to make a batch,
it might not be the case that your graph

1630
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,000
it might not be the case that your graph
 

1631
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,829
it might not be the case that your graph
has the same number of nodes. Many

1632
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:25,839
has the same number of nodes. Many
 

1633
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,430
has the same number of nodes. Many
natural settings, graphs have different

1634
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,440
natural settings, graphs have different
 

1635
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,910
natural settings, graphs have different
numbers of nodes. So think about, you

1636
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
numbers of nodes. So think about, you
 

1637
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,510
numbers of nodes. So think about, you
know, amino acids. The amino acids don't

1638
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,520
know, amino acids. The amino acids don't
 

1639
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,150
know, amino acids. The amino acids don't
have the same number of atoms in them.

1640
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,160
have the same number of atoms in them.
 

1641
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,710
have the same number of atoms in them.
They're different.

1642
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:38,720
They're different.
 

1643
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,910
They're different.
They might be related to each other. So

1644
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:39,920
They might be related to each other. So
 

1645
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,349
They might be related to each other. So
you want to train one network on all the

1646
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:41,359
you want to train one network on all the
 

1647
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,069
you want to train one network on all the
amino acids, but that doesn't work. So

1648
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:46,079
amino acids, but that doesn't work. So
 

1649
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,310
amino acids, but that doesn't work. So
there's a whole level of complexity in

1650
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,320
there's a whole level of complexity in
 

1651
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,790
there's a whole level of complexity in
thinking about batches in graph neural

1652
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:50,800
thinking about batches in graph neural
 

1653
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,510
thinking about batches in graph neural
nets that we're not going to talk about.

1654
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520
nets that we're not going to talk about.
 

1655
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,710
nets that we're not going to talk about.
So batch normalization type ideas are

1656
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:56,720
So batch normalization type ideas are
 

1657
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,829
So batch normalization type ideas are
sort of don't quite work

1658
00:36:59,829 --> 00:36:59,839
sort of don't quite work
 

1659
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,310
sort of don't quite work
naturally in units.

1660
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:04,320

 

1661
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,390

Okay, so

1662
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,400
Okay, so
 

1663
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,430
Okay, so
this one is kind of out uh for what to

1664
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:09,440
this one is kind of out uh for what to
 

1665
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,870
this one is kind of out uh for what to
do because it's hard to even deal with

1666
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:10,880
do because it's hard to even deal with
 

1667
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,589
do because it's hard to even deal with
the batch.

1668
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:13,599
the batch.
 

1669
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,430
the batch.
Next is sort of layerm. So layerm

1670
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,440
Next is sort of layerm. So layerm
 

1671
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,790
Next is sort of layerm. So layerm
doesn't look at the batches. It doesn't

1672
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
doesn't look at the batches. It doesn't
 

1673
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,150
doesn't look at the batches. It doesn't
care the fact that this picture doesn't

1674
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
care the fact that this picture doesn't
 

1675
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,510
care the fact that this picture doesn't
hold for the graph. You definitely have

1676
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
hold for the graph. You definitely have
 

1677
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,390
hold for the graph. You definitely have
a graph

1678
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:26,400
a graph
 

1679
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,510
a graph
and what lairs we have to do for layerm

1680
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520
and what lairs we have to do for layerm
 

1681
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,589
and what lairs we have to do for layerm
is we have to say okay

1682
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:35,599

 

1683
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,390

in a CNN we have

1684
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:38,400
in a CNN we have
 

1685
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,550
in a CNN we have
you know pixels that we were averaging

1686
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:40,560
you know pixels that we were averaging
 

1687
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,589
you know pixels that we were averaging
over and we were averaging over them to

1688
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:43,599
over and we were averaging over them to
 

1689
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,109
over and we were averaging over them to
get

1690
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:45,119
get
 

1691
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,270
get
two things first is we wanted to say

1692
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,280
two things first is we wanted to say
 

1693
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,910
two things first is we wanted to say
look let's get more averaging

1694
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:49,920
look let's get more averaging
 

1695
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,710
look let's get more averaging
okay than just our channels

1696
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:52,720
okay than just our channels
 

1697
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,470
okay than just our channels
Second thing we said is that in many

1698
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:54,480
Second thing we said is that in many
 

1699
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,990
Second thing we said is that in many
practical settings, you know, there

1700
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,000
practical settings, you know, there
 

1701
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,470
practical settings, you know, there
might be a cat somewhere in the image.

1702
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:58,480
might be a cat somewhere in the image.
 

1703
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,150
might be a cat somewhere in the image.
So just for the fact there's not a cat

1704
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,160
So just for the fact there's not a cat
 

1705
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,750
So just for the fact there's not a cat
here or this is a boring part of the

1706
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:01,760
here or this is a boring part of the
 

1707
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,270
here or this is a boring part of the
image, I don't want to accidentally have

1708
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,280
image, I don't want to accidentally have
 

1709
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,990
image, I don't want to accidentally have
the normalization do something to it. If

1710
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
the normalization do something to it. If
 

1711
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,190
the normalization do something to it. If
there's an interesting thing, I want to

1712
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,200
there's an interesting thing, I want to
 

1713
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,630
there's an interesting thing, I want to
keep the interesting thing being louder

1714
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,640
keep the interesting thing being louder
 

1715
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,829
keep the interesting thing being louder
than the boring parts, for example.

1716
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:11,839
than the boring parts, for example.
 

1717
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,190
than the boring parts, for example.
So that's why we're doing this. But

1718
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,200
So that's why we're doing this. But
 

1719
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,109
So that's why we're doing this. But
here,

1720
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:15,119
here,
 

1721
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,069
here,
when we replace this, the natural

1722
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:18,079
when we replace this, the natural
 

1723
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,430
when we replace this, the natural
counterpart to pixels is nodes.

1724
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:23,440

 

1725
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,069

And so it is possible to implement layer

1726
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:26,079
And so it is possible to implement layer
 

1727
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,069
And so it is possible to implement layer
on a graph neural net where you do an

1728
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:28,079
on a graph neural net where you do an
 

1729
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,069
on a graph neural net where you do an
average both over channels and over all

1730
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:30,079
average both over channels and over all
 

1731
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,829
average both over channels and over all
the nodes.

1732
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:31,839
the nodes.
 

1733
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,150
the nodes.
This requires

1734
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,160
This requires
 

1735
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,870
This requires
one thing though. It requires your graph

1736
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:36,880
one thing though. It requires your graph
 

1737
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,310
one thing though. It requires your graph
to fit in memory.

1738
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:40,320
to fit in memory.
 

1739
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,589
to fit in memory.
Now we're going to take that for granted

1740
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:41,599
Now we're going to take that for granted
 

1741
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,109
Now we're going to take that for granted
in all of our discussion. But

1742
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:43,119
in all of our discussion. But
 

1743
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,270
in all of our discussion. But
practically speaking that is sometimes

1744
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,280
practically speaking that is sometimes
 

1745
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,030
practically speaking that is sometimes
not true.

1746
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,040
not true.
 

1747
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,710
not true.
Think about the graph of Facebook.

1748
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720
Think about the graph of Facebook.
 

1749
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,990
Think about the graph of Facebook.
right? Has a massive social network. It

1750
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,000
right? Has a massive social network. It
 

1751
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,310
right? Has a massive social network. It
doesn't fit in memory.

1752
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:58,320

 

1753
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,990

So, but they want to train on this giant

1754
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,000
So, but they want to train on this giant
 

1755
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,550
So, but they want to train on this giant
graph. What do you do? So, there's all

1756
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560
graph. What do you do? So, there's all
 

1757
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,150
graph. What do you do? So, there's all
this work in graph neural nets that is

1758
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,160
this work in graph neural nets that is
 

1759
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,390
this work in graph neural nets that is
also dealing with the case of when your

1760
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:06,400
also dealing with the case of when your
 

1761
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,550
also dealing with the case of when your
graph is too big to even fit in memory,

1762
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:08,560
graph is too big to even fit in memory,
 

1763
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,790
graph is too big to even fit in memory,
what do you do? Not a problem in CNN's.

1764
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:10,800
what do you do? Not a problem in CNN's.
 

1765
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,230
what do you do? Not a problem in CNN's.
We never work with images that are too

00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,240
We never work with images that are too
 

1767
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,230
We never work with images that are too
big to fit in memory.

1768
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:16,240

 

1769
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,109

>> Yes. I think like different graphs might

1770
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:19,119
>> Yes. I think like different graphs might
 

1771
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,630
>> Yes. I think like different graphs might
might have like different number of

might have like different number of
 

1773
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,990
might have like different number of
nodes, right? Uh

1774
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,000
nodes, right? Uh
 

1775
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,710
nodes, right? Uh
>> yes.

1776
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:22,720
>> yes.
 

1777
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,950
>> yes.
>> So how are we supposed to

1778
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:26,960

 

1779
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,310

>> Okay, so I I said before this

1780
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:30,320
>> Okay, so I I said before this
 

1781
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,109
>> Okay, so I I said before this
not a good picture

1782
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:33,119
not a good picture
 

1783
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,270
not a good picture
because batches don't have the same

1784
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,280
because batches don't have the same
 

1785
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,430
because batches don't have the same
shape. So we really don't want to go

1786
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,440
shape. So we really don't want to go
 

1787
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,349
shape. So we really don't want to go
across batches.

1788
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:39,359
across batches.
 

1789
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,510
across batches.
There are techniques for doing batch

1790
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,520
There are techniques for doing batch
 

1791
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,270
There are techniques for doing batch
type stuff in graph neural nets, but I'm

1792
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,280
type stuff in graph neural nets, but I'm
 

1793
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,550
type stuff in graph neural nets, but I'm
not going to talk about them because

1794
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:44,560
not going to talk about them because
 

1795
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,950
not going to talk about them because
they're much more complicated.

1796
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:46,960
they're much more complicated.
 

1797
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,349
they're much more complicated.
So different different graphs might have

1798
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:49,359
So different different graphs might have
 

1799
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,790
So different different graphs might have
different number of nodes. So we just

1800
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:50,800
different number of nodes. So we just
 

1801
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,310
different number of nodes. So we just
never try to combine information across

1802
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
never try to combine information across
 

1803
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,750
never try to combine information across
different graphs in one training map.

1804
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:55,760
different graphs in one training map.
 

1805
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,230
different graphs in one training map.
>> Yes.

1806
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,240
>> Yes.
 

1807
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,750
>> Yes.
>> So in this case layer norm is sort of

1808
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:57,760
>> So in this case layer norm is sort of
 

1809
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,349

just like I'm going to go through all my

1810
00:39:59,349 --> 00:39:59,359
just like I'm going to go through all my
 

1811
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,109
just like I'm going to go through all my
nodes. I'm going to check all the

1812
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:01,119
nodes. I'm going to check all the
 

1813
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,430
nodes. I'm going to check all the
channels take the average of every

1814
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,440
channels take the average of every
 

1815
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,950
channels take the average of every
channel value of every node.

1816
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
channel value of every node.
 

1817
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,430

>> Yeah.

1818
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:05,440
>> Yeah.
 

1819
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,470
>> Yeah.
>> And that's like okay.

1820
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:06,480
>> And that's like okay.
 

1821
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,750
>> And that's like okay.
>> Yeah. This is like basically saying I

1822
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:07,760
>> Yeah. This is like basically saying I
 

1823
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,270
>> Yeah. This is like basically saying I
want the for example you think of the

1824
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:09,280
want the for example you think of the
 

1825
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,270
want the for example you think of the
RMS norm point of view. I want the

1826
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:11,280
RMS norm point of view. I want the
 

1827
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,870
RMS norm point of view. I want the
average RMS norm of my activations for

00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:14,880
average RMS norm of my activations for
 

1829
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,069
average RMS norm of my activations for
this particular output of this layer for

this particular output of this layer for
 

1831
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,829
this particular output of this layer for
my entire graph to be one.

So that's what layerm would do. Layerm

1834
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:23,680
So that's what layerm would do. Layerm
 

1835
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,349
So that's what layerm would do. Layerm
style would do laror of course actual

lair norm also has this mean correction

1838
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:26,960
lair norm also has this mean correction
 

1839
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,750
lair norm also has this mean correction
but you know that's a that's a level of

00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:29,760
but you know that's a that's a level of
 

1841
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,270
but you know that's a that's a level of
detail that doesn't matter for the graph

1842
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:31,280
detail that doesn't matter for the graph
 

1843
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,069
detail that doesn't matter for the graph
to CNN distinction. Yes. If you think of

1844
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,079
to CNN distinction. Yes. If you think of
 

1845
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,470
to CNN distinction. Yes. If you think of
the channels as like the dimensions in

1846
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:36,480
the channels as like the dimensions in
 

1847
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,710
the channels as like the dimensions in
the vectors for each node, then is it

1848
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:38,720
the vectors for each node, then is it
 

1849
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,230
the vectors for each node, then is it
possible for different nodes to have

1850
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:40,240
possible for different nodes to have
 

1851
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,589
possible for different nodes to have
different dimensional vectors and

1852
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
different dimensional vectors and
 

1853
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,069
different dimensional vectors and
therefore the channels aren't the same?

1854
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:44,079
therefore the channels aren't the same?
 

1855
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,230
therefore the channels aren't the same?
>> Great question. The question was, is it

inputs? The answer is maybe in your

1862
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:52,560
inputs? The answer is maybe in your
 

1863
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,630
inputs? The answer is maybe in your
original problem, but not when you start

original problem, but not when you start
 

1865
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,030
original problem, but not when you start
feeding into the GNN.

1866
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,040
feeding into the GNN.
 

1867
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,109
feeding into the GNN.
You enforce that the same number of

1868
00:40:59,109 --> 00:40:59,119
You enforce that the same number of
 

1869
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,829
You enforce that the same number of
channels exist everywhere.

1870
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:03,839

 

1871
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,230

So this leaves one more choice which we

1872
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,240
So this leaves one more choice which we
 

1873
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,390
So this leaves one more choice which we
didn't talk about before but it's a very

1874
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:08,400
didn't talk about before but it's a very
 

1875
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,030
didn't talk about before but it's a very
natural choice which just says yeah

1876
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,040
natural choice which just says yeah
 

1877
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,589
natural choice which just says yeah
don't don't try to do any averaging over

1878
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
don't don't try to do any averaging over
 

1879
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,349
don't don't try to do any averaging over
nodes just look at every node by itself

1880
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:17,359
nodes just look at every node by itself
 

1881
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,750
nodes just look at every node by itself
look at its channels

1882
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:19,760
look at its channels
 

1883
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,030
look at its channels
and just normalize that.

1884
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,040
and just normalize that.
 

1885
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,630
and just normalize that.
Okay, so in general the term that's used

1886
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:26,640
Okay, so in general the term that's used
 

1887
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,230
Okay, so in general the term that's used
for the channels, the vectors that are

1888
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
for the channels, the vectors that are
 

1889
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,150
for the channels, the vectors that are
sitting in a neural net at a particular

1890
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,160
sitting in a neural net at a particular
 

1891
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,790
sitting in a neural net at a particular
entity like a like a node in a graph or

1892
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:34,800
entity like a like a node in a graph or
 

1893
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,829
entity like a like a node in a graph or
pixel, it's called an embedding. That's

1894
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:37,839
pixel, it's called an embedding. That's
 

1895
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,510
pixel, it's called an embedding. That's
the word that's used for that. So this

1896
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:39,520
the word that's used for that. So this
 

1897
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,109
the word that's used for that. So this
is just looking at the embedding just

1898
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:41,119
is just looking at the embedding just
 

1899
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,589
is just looking at the embedding just
per embedding normalization.

1900
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:43,599
per embedding normalization.
 

1901
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,630
per embedding normalization.
You can do this for sure

1902
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:46,640
You can do this for sure
 

1903
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,150
You can do this for sure
and just apply the same embedding at

1904
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,160
and just apply the same embedding at
 

1905
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,309
and just apply the same embedding at
every node. the weights are shared if

1906
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:50,319
every node. the weights are shared if
 

1907
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,670
every node. the weights are shared if
you have learnable weights like for

1908
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,680
you have learnable weights like for
 

1909
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,670
you have learnable weights like for
example for scale or shift but if you're

1910
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:53,680
example for scale or shift but if you're
 

1911
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,270
example for scale or shift but if you're
doing like an RMS norm peg to one

1912
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,280
doing like an RMS norm peg to one
 

1913
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,109
doing like an RMS norm peg to one
there's no learnable weights at all

1914
00:41:59,109 --> 00:41:59,119
there's no learnable weights at all
 

1915
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,630
there's no learnable weights at all
as always weights are shared across

1916
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:00,640
as always weights are shared across
 

1917
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,390
as always weights are shared across
nodes

1918
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
nodes
 

1919
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,630
nodes
but there's no you don't have to look at

1920
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:04,640
but there's no you don't have to look at
 

1921
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,990
but there's no you don't have to look at
what's going on in another node to

1922
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,000
what's going on in another node to
 

1923
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,309
what's going on in another node to
compute how to normalize this particular

1924
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:08,319
compute how to normalize this particular
 

1925
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,950
compute how to normalize this particular
value so this is the easy choice any

1926
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:10,960
value so this is the easy choice any
 

1927
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,430
value so this is the easy choice any
questions on this

1928
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,440
questions on this
 

1929
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,270
questions on this
so by default in a graph neural net

1930
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,280
so by default in a graph neural net
 

1931
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,190
so by default in a graph neural net
you'll just do this

1932
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,200

 

1933
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,630

Okay. So now we've talked about all the

1934
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:24,640
Okay. So now we've talked about all the
 

1935
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,870
Okay. So now we've talked about all the
stuff you know here this is easy this

1936
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:28,880
stuff you know here this is easy this
 

1937
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,030
stuff you know here this is easy this
we've now covered.

1938
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,040
we've now covered.
 

1939
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,829
we've now covered.
So let's keep going

1940
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:33,839
So let's keep going
 

1941
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,550
So let's keep going
and let's say okay are we done and the

1942
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:36,560
and let's say okay are we done and the
 

1943
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:41,109
and let's say okay are we done and the
answer is no. Okay we are not done. Um

1944
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,119
answer is no. Okay we are not done. Um
 

1945
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,270
answer is no. Okay we are not done. Um
why are we not done? Because there's

1946
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:43,280
why are we not done? Because there's
 

1947
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,030
why are we not done? Because there's
many kinds of graphs. I showed you

1948
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:45,040
many kinds of graphs. I showed you
 

1949
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,309
many kinds of graphs. I showed you
pictures and we've talked about this

1950
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:48,319
pictures and we've talked about this
 

1951
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,069
pictures and we've talked about this
case

1952
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:50,079
case
 

1953
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,470
case
where we have finite set of edge labels

1954
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:52,480
where we have finite set of edge labels
 

1955
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,109
where we have finite set of edge labels
in a directed graph.

1956
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:55,119
in a directed graph.
 

1957
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,589
in a directed graph.
We can do that.

1958
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
We can do that.
 

1959
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,069
We can do that.
But there's also directed graphs where

1960
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:00,079
But there's also directed graphs where
 

1961
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,829
But there's also directed graphs where
you have infinite edge labels. For

1962
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:01,839
you have infinite edge labels. For
 

1963
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,069
you have infinite edge labels. For
example, continuous things. For example,

1964
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:04,079
example, continuous things. For example,
 

1965
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,510
example, continuous things. For example,
what some people you might call weights

1966
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:05,520
what some people you might call weights
 

1967
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,710
what some people you might call weights
on graphs, weighted on weights on edges.

1968
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:08,720
on graphs, weighted on weights on edges.
 

1969
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,829
on graphs, weighted on weights on edges.
We don't know how to deal with that.

1970
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:11,839
We don't know how to deal with that.
 

1971
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,790
We don't know how to deal with that.
um you have undirected graphs which we

1972
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:14,800
um you have undirected graphs which we
 

1973
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,349
um you have undirected graphs which we
don't know how to deal with and you have

1974
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:17,359
don't know how to deal with and you have
 

1975
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,349
don't know how to deal with and you have
cases where you don't have labels.

1976
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:21,359
cases where you don't have labels.
 

1977
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,430
cases where you don't have labels.
We don't know how to deal with that. So

1978
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:23,440
We don't know how to deal with that. So
 

1979
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,829
We don't know how to deal with that. So
the most different than this is this

1980
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:25,839
the most different than this is this
 

1981
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,270
the most different than this is this
corner. Does everyone see that? So we're

1982
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,280
corner. Does everyone see that? So we're
 

1983
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,230
corner. Does everyone see that? So we're
going to talk about this corner next

1984
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240
going to talk about this corner next
 

1985
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,750
going to talk about this corner next
because the ideas that we use to cover

1986
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:33,760
because the ideas that we use to cover
 

1987
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,230
because the ideas that we use to cover
this corner will then help us understand

1988
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:36,240
this corner will then help us understand
 

1989
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,670
this corner will then help us understand
everything in here.

1990
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
everything in here.
 

1991
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,550
everything in here.
>> Yes.

1992
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:38,560
>> Yes.
 

1993
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,710
>> Yes.
>> Yeah. I just don't get why we are so

1994
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:42,720
>> Yeah. I just don't get why we are so
 

1995
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,030
>> Yeah. I just don't get why we are so
attached to the fact that the graph is

1996
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
attached to the fact that the graph is
 

1997
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,069
attached to the fact that the graph is
directed or undirected because like if

1998
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:48,079
directed or undirected because like if
 

1999
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,309
directed or undirected because like if
I'm the pixel behind you, you are the

00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:50,319
I'm the pixel behind you, you are the
 

2001
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,670
I'm the pixel behind you, you are the
pixel on top of me. So,

2002
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:53,680
pixel on top of me. So,
 

2003
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,190
pixel on top of me. So,
>> but we have a different relationship.

2004
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:55,200
>> but we have a different relationship.
 

2005
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,309
>> but we have a different relationship.
The important thing is we have a

2006
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:56,319
The important thing is we have a
 

2007
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,710
The important thing is we have a
different relationship to each other.

2008
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
different relationship to each other.
 

2009
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,230
different relationship to each other.
So, when you have two pixels next to

2010
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,240
So, when you have two pixels next to
 

2011
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,750
So, when you have two pixels next to
each other, one is on the right and one

2012
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:01,760
each other, one is on the right and one
 

2013
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,829
each other, one is on the right and one
is on the left.

2014
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:03,839
is on the left.
 

2015
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,030
is on the left.
>> That matters for the conf.

00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,040
>> That matters for the conf.
 

2017
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,309
>> That matters for the conf.
is not just that they're next to each

2018
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:08,319
is not just that they're next to each
 

2019
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,750
is not just that they're next to each

2020
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:11,760

 

2021
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,390

So

2022
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:12,400
So
 

2023
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,950
So

2027
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,430

this clear in a little bit but here's a

2028
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,440
this clear in a little bit but here's a
 

2029
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,190
this clear in a little bit but here's a
way of thinking about it suppose I

2030
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:27,200
way of thinking about it suppose I
 

2031
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,470
way of thinking about it suppose I
didn't I wanted to take the image

2032
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:28,480
didn't I wanted to take the image
 

2033
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,109
didn't I wanted to take the image
picture here

2034
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
picture here
 

2035
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,109
picture here
so let's look at this image picture and

2036
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:33,119
so let's look at this image picture and
 

2037
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,550
so let's look at this image picture and
suppose I just dropped all the labels

2038
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:36,560
suppose I just dropped all the labels
 

2039
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,510
suppose I just dropped all the labels
okay so I drop all the labels then this

2040
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:39,520
okay so I drop all the labels then this
 

2041
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,870
okay so I drop all the labels then this
pixel

2042
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:40,880
pixel
 

2043
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,990
pixel
knows it has nine neighbors,

2044
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:44,000
knows it has nine neighbors,
 

2045
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,910
knows it has nine neighbors,
but it doesn't know which ones are up

2046
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:45,920
but it doesn't know which ones are up
 

2047
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,390
but it doesn't know which ones are up
and which ones are down.

2048
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,400
and which ones are down.
 

2049
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,790
and which ones are down.
Does everyone see that? So, for example,

2050
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:50,800
Does everyone see that? So, for example,
 

2051
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,790
Does everyone see that? So, for example,
can I detect a vertical edge

2052
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:56,800

 

2053
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,630

versus a horizontal edge versus a random

2054
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:00,640
versus a horizontal edge versus a random
 

2055
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,270
versus a horizontal edge versus a random
scatter? I cannot because a vertical

2056
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:03,280
scatter? I cannot because a vertical
 

2057
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,109
scatter? I cannot because a vertical
edge is characterized by the idea that

2058
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:05,119
edge is characterized by the idea that
 

2059
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,710
edge is characterized by the idea that
there is some you know something

2060
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:06,720
there is some you know something
 

2061
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,309
there is some you know something
happening over here and then something

2062
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:08,319
happening over here and then something
 

2063
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,950
happening over here and then something
different happening over here but all I

2064
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:10,960
different happening over here but all I
 

2065
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,790
different happening over here but all I
have is a collection of edges so I can't

2066
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:14,800
have is a collection of edges so I can't
 

2067
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,349
have is a collection of edges so I can't
tell. So there's definitely a

2068
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:17,359
tell. So there's definitely a
 

2069
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,069
tell. So there's definitely a
restriction in what you can do if you

2070
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:20,079
restriction in what you can do if you
 

2071
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,349
restriction in what you can do if you
don't have labels on edges. Does that in

2072
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359
don't have labels on edges. Does that in
 

2073
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,069
don't have labels on edges. Does that in
that intuition become clear?

2074
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:26,079
that intuition become clear?
 

2075
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,510
that intuition become clear?
So it's non-trivial what to do

2076
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,520

 

2077
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,230

in this setting.

2078
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:34,240
in this setting.
 

2079
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,430
in this setting.
Okay. So go back. Okay. So here's an

2080
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:39,440
Okay. So go back. Okay. So here's an
 

2081
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,829
Okay. So go back. Okay. So here's an
attempt that we can do that won't work

2082
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:41,839
attempt that we can do that won't work
 

2083
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,910
attempt that we can do that won't work
but it's I showed you in pictures but

2084
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:43,920
but it's I showed you in pictures but
 

2085
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,109
but it's I showed you in pictures but
it's good to sort of think about it in

2086
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:45,119
it's good to sort of think about it in
 

2087
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,950
it's good to sort of think about it in
math.

2088
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:46,960
math.
 

2089
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,030
math.
So the first attempt says let's try to

2090
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040
So the first attempt says let's try to
 

2091
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,589
So the first attempt says let's try to
reduce to the understood case. So I

2092
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:51,599
reduce to the understood case. So I
 

2093
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,270
reduce to the understood case. So I
understand how to do directed with edge

2094
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:53,280
understand how to do directed with edge
 

2095
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,589
understand how to do directed with edge
finite edge labels. I don't have any

2096
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:55,599
finite edge labels. I don't have any
 

2097
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,069
finite edge labels. I don't have any
edge labels. So you could think not

2098
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,079
edge labels. So you could think not
 

2099
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,790
edge labels. So you could think not
having any is finite zero,

2100
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:02,800
having any is finite zero,
 

2101
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,950
having any is finite zero,
right? So I could just assign remember

2102
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:04,960
right? So I could just assign remember
 

2103
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,870
right? So I could just assign remember
we're processing it how we want to. So I

2104
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
we're processing it how we want to. So I
 

2105
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,870
we're processing it how we want to. So I
could just assign a label to everything.

2106
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:08,880
could just assign a label to everything.
 

2107
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,270
could just assign a label to everything.
Call everything edge.

2108
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:11,280
Call everything edge.
 

2109
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,630
Call everything edge.
I have a labeled edge labeled edge.

2110
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:14,640
I have a labeled edge labeled edge.
 

2111
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,309
I have a labeled edge labeled edge.
Okay?

2112
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:16,319
Okay?
 

2113
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,030
Okay?
And if I have an undirected edge, I just

2114
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:19,040
And if I have an undirected edge, I just
 

2115
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,550
And if I have an undirected edge, I just
say, yeah, I have edges in both

2116
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,560
say, yeah, I have edges in both
 

2117
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,470
say, yeah, I have edges in both
directions

2118
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,480
directions
 

2119
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,349
directions
and they're both labeled edge.

2120
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:25,359
and they're both labeled edge.
 

2121
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,309
and they're both labeled edge.
Okay,

2122
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
Okay,
 

2123
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,710
Okay,
so that now I've reduced it from here

2124
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:30,720
so that now I've reduced it from here
 

2125
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,670
so that now I've reduced it from here
syntactically into this case and I can

2126
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:33,680
syntactically into this case and I can
 

2127
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,069
syntactically into this case and I can
run all the machinery that I have. But

2128
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:36,079
run all the machinery that I have. But
 

2129
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,750
run all the machinery that I have. But
what does that machinery do?

2130
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:39,760
what does that machinery do?
 

2131
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,550
what does that machinery do?
That machinery would do this. A con

2132
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:42,560
That machinery would do this. A con
 

2133
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,190
That machinery would do this. A con
would look like this. But I wouldn't

2134
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,200
would look like this. But I wouldn't
 

2135
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,150
would look like this. But I wouldn't
have an index on the W.

2136
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:48,160
have an index on the W.
 

2137
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,349
have an index on the W.
I'm missing something, right? I'm

2138
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:49,359
I'm missing something, right? I'm
 

2139
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:55,430
I'm missing something, right? I'm
missing a subscript.

2140
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:55,440

 

2141
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,910

But then

2142
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:57,920
But then
 

2143
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,069
But then
unfortunately

2144
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:00,079
unfortunately
 

2145
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,750
unfortunately
the W can be brought outside the sum.

2146
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:03,760
the W can be brought outside the sum.
 

2147
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,589
the W can be brought outside the sum.
Does everyone see that?

2148
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:07,599

 

2149
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,109

So you might think, what's so

2150
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:09,119
So you might think, what's so
 

2151
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:22,470
So you might think, what's so
unfortunate about this? Okay.

2152
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:22,480

 

2153
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,990

Everyone see that? We do this. But now

2154
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:26,000
Everyone see that? We do this. But now
 

2155
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,790
Everyone see that? We do this. But now
all I can do is average my neighbors or

2156
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:28,800
all I can do is average my neighbors or
 

2157
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,430
all I can do is average my neighbors or
add them up. That's all I can do.

2158
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:33,440
add them up. That's all I can do.
 

2159
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,470
add them up. That's all I can do.
I can then do some scaling on it, but

2160
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:36,480
I can then do some scaling on it, but
 

2161
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,150
I can then do some scaling on it, but
not not really. If I take this picture.

2162
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,160

 

2163
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,910

So what ends up happening in these

2164
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:43,920
So what ends up happening in these
 

2165
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,670
So what ends up happening in these
situations is when you run a graph

2166
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680
situations is when you run a graph
 

2167
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,430
situations is when you run a graph
neural net like this, you get a

2168
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:47,440
neural net like this, you get a
 

2169
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,710
neural net like this, you get a
phenomena that's sometimes called

2170
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:50,720
phenomena that's sometimes called
 

2171
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,750
phenomena that's sometimes called
dramatic over smoothing.

2172
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:53,760
dramatic over smoothing.
 

2173
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,670
dramatic over smoothing.
Okay. What happens when you average

2174
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:55,680
Okay. What happens when you average
 

2175
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,829
Okay. What happens when you average
together a bunch of things? At some

2176
00:47:57,829 --> 00:47:57,839
together a bunch of things? At some
 

2177
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,109
together a bunch of things? At some
point you just average everything

2178
00:47:59,109 --> 00:47:59,119
point you just average everything
 

2179
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,030
point you just average everything
together.

2180
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,040
together.
 

2181
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,109
together.
So lots of layers of processing. All you

2182
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:03,119
So lots of layers of processing. All you
 

2183
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,950
So lots of layers of processing. All you
end up doing is averaging everything.

2184
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:06,960
end up doing is averaging everything.
 

2185
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,670
end up doing is averaging everything.
So this is called over smoothing. Um

2186
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
So this is called over smoothing. Um
 

2187
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,190
So this is called over smoothing. Um
it's always a problem in graph neural

2188
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,200
it's always a problem in graph neural
 

2189
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,790
it's always a problem in graph neural
nets but this is like most dramatic case

2190
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:12,800
nets but this is like most dramatic case
 

2191
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,309
nets but this is like most dramatic case
of it. Um and so your expressive power

2192
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:16,319
of it. Um and so your expressive power
 

2193
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,470
of it. Um and so your expressive power
of the kinds of things you can compute

2194
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:18,480
of the kinds of things you can compute
 

2195
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,510
of the kinds of things you can compute
with this kind of network is too low.

2196
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:21,520
with this kind of network is too low.
 

2197
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,950
with this kind of network is too low.
You can't compute the interesting things

2198
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:22,960
You can't compute the interesting things
 

2199
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,870
You can't compute the interesting things
you want.

2200
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:24,880
you want.
 

2201
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,750
you want.
Questions on this?

2202
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:27,760
Questions on this?
 

2203
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,309
Questions on this?
Okay. So this approach doesn't work. So

2204
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:30,319
Okay. So this approach doesn't work. So
 

2205
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:34,230
Okay. So this approach doesn't work. So
we have to step back and ask what do we

2206
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,240
we have to step back and ask what do we
 

2207
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,790
we have to step back and ask what do we
actually know in this case?

2208
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:38,800

 

2209
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,309

What kind of what can we use?

2210
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:42,319
What kind of what can we use?
 

2211
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,910
What kind of what can we use?
So

2212
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:43,920
So
 

2213
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,710
So
we know that a node knows that it's

2214
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:46,720
we know that a node knows that it's
 

2215
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,950
we know that a node knows that it's
itself.

2216
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:48,960
itself.
 

2217
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,270
itself.
So it has a special piece of information

2218
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:51,280
So it has a special piece of information
 

2219
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,750
So it has a special piece of information
which is its own information H0 that

2220
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:53,760
which is its own information H0 that
 

2221
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,109
which is its own information H0 that
didn't come on any edge.

2222
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:57,119
didn't come on any edge.
 

2223
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,510
didn't come on any edge.
Okay. So you know that

2224
00:48:59,510 --> 00:48:59,520
Okay. So you know that
 

2225
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,990
Okay. So you know that
and you can treat it specially

2226
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,000
and you can treat it specially
 

2227
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,109
and you can treat it specially
here. We didn't treat it specially

2228
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:05,119
here. We didn't treat it specially
 

2229
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,069
here. We didn't treat it specially
but we could.

2230
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:10,079

 

2231
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,790

Second you know how many neighbors you

2232
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:12,800
Second you know how many neighbors you
 

2233
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,790
Second you know how many neighbors you
actually have

2234
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:14,800
actually have
 

2235
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,990
actually have
because you're getting message on some

2236
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,000
because you're getting message on some
 

2237
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,470
because you're getting message on some
edges. So you know that you're getting n

2238
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:18,480
edges. So you know that you're getting n
 

2239
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,870
edges. So you know that you're getting n
such messages. That's another piece of

2240
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:20,880
such messages. That's another piece of
 

2241
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,990
such messages. That's another piece of
information you can actually try to use.

2242
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:24,000
information you can actually try to use.
 

2243
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,069
information you can actually try to use.
So I could do averaging for example.

2244
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,079
So I could do averaging for example.
 

2245
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,510
So I could do averaging for example.
But that doesn't help me by itself.

2246
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:33,520

 

2247
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,390

And all I have a kind of mathematical

2248
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:36,400
And all I have a kind of mathematical
 

2249
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,470
And all I have a kind of mathematical
way to think about it is I have a set of

2250
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:40,480
way to think about it is I have a set of
 

2251
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,589
way to think about it is I have a set of
information from my neighbors. I don't

2252
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:43,599
information from my neighbors. I don't
 

2253
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,109
information from my neighbors. I don't
have a list. I have a set.

2254
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,119
have a list. I have a set.
 

2255
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,630
have a list. I have a set.
All of the information I'm getting from

2256
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:48,640
All of the information I'm getting from
 

2257
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:54,710
All of the information I'm getting from
my different edges is equivalent to me.

2258
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:54,720
my different edges is equivalent to me.
 

2259
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,710
my different edges is equivalent to me.
there's no ordering information in

2260
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:56,720
there's no ordering information in
 

2261
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,790
there's no ordering information in
there.

2262
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:58,800
there.
 

2263
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,589
there.
So I have to respect this and look at

2264
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:01,599
So I have to respect this and look at
 

2265
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,829
So I have to respect this and look at
what design freedom I have given that I

2266
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:03,839
what design freedom I have given that I
 

2267
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:08,230
what design freedom I have given that I
have this limit these limitations.

2268
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:08,240

 

2269
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,549

So the architectural constraints that

2270
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:10,559
So the architectural constraints that
 

2271
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,470
So the architectural constraints that
this creates for our graph neural net

2272
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:12,480
this creates for our graph neural net
 

2273
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,390
this creates for our graph neural net
that I have to obey to be true to the

2274
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:14,400
that I have to obey to be true to the
 

2275
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,349
that I have to obey to be true to the
graph is I can use n and h0 in a special

2276
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:19,359
graph is I can use n and h0 in a special
 

2277
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,990
graph is I can use n and h0 in a special
way but I have to be permutation

2278
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,000
way but I have to be permutation
 

2279
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,309
way but I have to be permutation
invariant to the other things.

2280
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:26,319
invariant to the other things.
 

2281
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,710
invariant to the other things.
Okay.

2282
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:28,720
Okay.
 

2283
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,069
Okay.
So one such thing I could do is this.

2284
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:32,079
So one such thing I could do is this.
 

2285
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,470
So one such thing I could do is this.
But this is bad because of the fact this

2286
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:34,480
But this is bad because of the fact this
 

2287
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,230
But this is bad because of the fact this
is commuting.

2288
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:36,240
is commuting.
 

2289
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,750
is commuting.
I can pull the sorry I can pull the uh w

2290
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:39,760
I can pull the sorry I can pull the uh w
 

2291
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,549
I can pull the sorry I can pull the uh w
out of the sum the linearity.

2292
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:44,559

 

2293
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:52,390

So now the question is what can we do?

2294
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:52,400

 

2295
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,030

So here's an example of something we can

2296
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:55,040
So here's an example of something we can
 

2297
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,829
So here's an example of something we can
do

2298
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:57,839
do
 

2299
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,230
do
as a general form.

2300
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
as a general form.
 

2301
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,150
as a general form.
I want learnable weights. So I have some

2302
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:02,160
I want learnable weights. So I have some
 

2303
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,630
I want learnable weights. So I have some
function f with learnable weights.

2304
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,640
function f with learnable weights.
 

2305
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,349
function f with learnable weights.
It takes two distinct arguments

2306
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
It takes two distinct arguments
 

2307
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,710
It takes two distinct arguments
me because I can tell me and then it

2308
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:14,720
me because I can tell me and then it
 

2309
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,030
me because I can tell me and then it
just takes a sum

2310
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:17,040
just takes a sum
 

2311
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,630
just takes a sum
of

2312
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:18,640
of
 

2313
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,230
of
some other learnable function applied to

2314
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,240
some other learnable function applied to
 

2315
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,430
some other learnable function applied to
information I'm getting from my

2316
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:23,440
information I'm getting from my
 

2317
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,270
information I'm getting from my
neighbors. This is legal.

2318
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280
neighbors. This is legal.
 

2319
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,630
neighbors. This is legal.
Okay, does everyone see why this is

2320
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:28,640
Okay, does everyone see why this is
 

2321
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,510
Okay, does everyone see why this is
legal? Because I'm using things that I'm

2322
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:31,520
legal? Because I'm using things that I'm
 

2323
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,270
legal? Because I'm using things that I'm
allowed to use. I'm allowed to use

2324
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
allowed to use. I'm allowed to use
 

2325
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,750
allowed to use. I'm allowed to use
myself specially and I have to be

2326
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:35,760
myself specially and I have to be
 

2327
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,309
myself specially and I have to be
permutation invariant and a sum is

2328
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:38,319
permutation invariant and a sum is
 

2329
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,510
permutation invariant and a sum is
permutation invariant

2330
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
permutation invariant
 

2331
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,030
permutation invariant
and I'm doing the same thing to all my

2332
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,040
and I'm doing the same thing to all my
 

2333
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,630
and I'm doing the same thing to all my
neighbors. My neighbors are being

2334
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:44,640
neighbors. My neighbors are being
 

2335
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,870
neighbors. My neighbors are being
treated symmetrically.

2336
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:46,880
treated symmetrically.
 

2337
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,670
treated symmetrically.
Okay. So now I want everyone to take one

2338
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:51,680
Okay. So now I want everyone to take one
 

2339
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,990
Okay. So now I want everyone to take one
minute talk to your neighbors and ask

2340
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:56,000
minute talk to your neighbors and ask
 

2341
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,510
minute talk to your neighbors and ask
yourself you can compute a list of other

2342
00:51:59,510 --> 00:51:59,520
yourself you can compute a list of other
 

2343
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,150
yourself you can compute a list of other
permutation invariant sum like

2344
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
permutation invariant sum like

Only one other thing.
 

2383
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,030
Only one other thing.
Two other things. Couple of people.

2384
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040
Two other things. Couple of people.
 

2385
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,069
Two other things. Couple of people.
Three other things.

2386
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079
Three other things.
 

2387
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,109
Three other things.
Okay. Slightly more people. Four other

2388
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:41,119
Okay. Slightly more people. Four other
 

2389
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,990
Okay. Slightly more people. Four other
things. Okay. More. Five.

2390
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,000
things. Okay. More. Five.
 

2391
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,190
things. Okay. More. Five.
Six. Six.

2392
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:49,200
Six. Six.
 

2393
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,950
Six. Six.
Seven. Any other number higher?

2394
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:52,960
Seven. Any other number higher?
 

2395
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,390
Seven. Any other number higher?
Okay. So, let's just let's let's go

2396
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:54,400
Okay. So, let's just let's let's go
 

2397
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,069
Okay. So, let's just let's let's go
through and see what we can get. How

2398
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:56,079
through and see what we can get. How
 

2399
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,670
through and see what we can get. How
many different things we can get. Some

2400
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:57,680
many different things we can get. Some
 

2401
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,950
many different things we can get. Some
will be similar presumably to each

2402
00:53:58,950 --> 00:53:58,960
will be similar presumably to each
 

2403
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,430
will be similar presumably to each
other. But someone want to start with a

2404
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:01,440
other. But someone want to start with a
 

2405
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,030
other. But someone want to start with a
list?

2406
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:05,040

 

2407
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,790

Someone said multiplication. Fine.

2408
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:06,800
Someone said multiplication. Fine.
 

2409
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,190
Someone said multiplication. Fine.
multiplication.

2410
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:09,200
multiplication.
 

2411
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,069
multiplication.
Okay, multiplication

2412
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079

 

2413
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,710

true doesn't care about the order, but

2414
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:16,720
true doesn't care about the order, but
 

2415
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,150
true doesn't care about the order, but
you can just take logs and treat it as a

2416
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:18,160
you can just take logs and treat it as a
 

2417
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,470
you can just take logs and treat it as a
sum. So, it's kind of same thing kind

2418
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:20,480
sum. So, it's kind of same thing kind
 

2419
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,790
sum. So, it's kind of same thing kind
same kind of thing, but good to know.

2420
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:22,800
same kind of thing, but good to know.
 

2421
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,910
same kind of thing, but good to know.
Um, what else over there?

2422
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:25,920
Um, what else over there?
 

2423
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,870
Um, what else over there?
>> Um, inverse of the sum of inverses.

2424
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:28,880
>> Um, inverse of the sum of inverses.
 

2425
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,790
>> Um, inverse of the sum of inverses.
>> Inverse of sums of inverses. Yeah. Okay.

2426
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:30,800
>> Inverse of sums of inverses. Yeah. Okay.
 

2427
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,910
>> Inverse of sums of inverses. Yeah. Okay.
So, they're compositions. So what I you

2428
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:33,920
So, they're compositions. So what I you
 

2429
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,109
So, they're compositions. So what I you
can do in this picture here

2430
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:37,119
can do in this picture here
 

2431
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,870
can do in this picture here
if you think about something which is

2432
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:38,880
if you think about something which is
 

2433
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,150
if you think about something which is
basically an inverse

2434
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:42,160
basically an inverse
 

2435
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,829
basically an inverse
a sum of inverses and inverting that

2436
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:45,839
a sum of inverses and inverting that
 

2437
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,589
a sum of inverses and inverting that
that's all already contained in the

2438
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:47,599
that's all already contained in the
 

2439
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:48,950
that's all already contained in the
expressive power of what you're doing

2440
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:48,960
expressive power of what you're doing
 

2441
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,950
expressive power of what you're doing
here. So I'm not looking for things that

2442
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:50,960
here. So I'm not looking for things that
 

2443
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,270
here. So I'm not looking for things that
do operations and then take sums and

2444
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:53,280
do operations and then take sums and
 

2445
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,109
do operations and then take sums and
then do other things to that. Okay. So

2446
00:54:55,109 --> 00:54:55,119
then do other things to that. Okay. So
 

2447
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,349
then do other things to that. Okay. So
I'm not going to count that as a a

2448
00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:57,359
I'm not going to count that as a a
 

2449
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,589
I'm not going to count that as a a
choice.

2450
00:54:59,589 --> 00:54:59,599
choice.
 

2451
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:00,150
choice.
>> Yeah.

2452
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,160
>> Yeah.
 

2453
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,270
>> Yeah.
>> Min or max?

2454

>> Min or max?
 

2455
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,349
>> Min or max?
>> Min or max. Yeah,

2456
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:07,359

 

2457
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:11,750

those don't care. Um, what else? Yeah.

2458
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:11,760
those don't care. Um, what else? Yeah.
 

2459
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,230
those don't care. Um, what else? Yeah.
>> Yeah.

2460
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:12,240
>> Yeah.
 

2461
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,430
>> Yeah.
>> Median.

2465
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,710

Because you can just sort, right? And

2466
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,720
Because you can just sort, right? And
 

2467
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,950
Because you can just sort, right? And
then you could do something. Yeah. Min,

2468
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:24,960
then you could do something. Yeah. Min,
 

2469
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,870
then you could do something. Yeah. Min,

like that.
>> General order statistics. Yeah.

2478
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:38,960

 

2479
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,710

These are things like median, right?

2480
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:40,720
These are things like median, right?
 

2481
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,870
These are things like median, right?
These are all in the f friends of

2482
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:42,880
These are all in the f friends of
 

2483

Um, okay. Good.

2486
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:50,160

 

2487
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,109

Yeah.

2488
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:51,119
Yeah.
 

2489
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,150
Yeah.
>> Norms.

2490
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160
>> Norms.
 

2491
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,390
>> Norms.
>> Norms. Yep.

2492
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:54,400
>> Norms. Yep.
 

2493
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,589
>> Norms. Yep.
As long as the norm doesn't care about

2494
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:57,599
As long as the norm doesn't care about
 

2495
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,109
As long as the norm doesn't care about
the ordering. So, uh, certain norms. So

2496
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:01,119
the ordering. So, uh, certain norms. So
 

2497
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,910
the ordering. So, uh, certain norms. So
all the LP type norms are all fine but

2498
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:03,920
all the LP type norms are all fine but
 

2499
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,190
all the LP type norms are all fine but
for example if you think about a norm

2500
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:05,200
for example if you think about a norm
 

2501
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,670
for example if you think about a norm
that involves a quadratic form inside

2502
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:07,680
that involves a quadratic form inside
 

2503
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,510
that involves a quadratic form inside
right that will not be legal because you

2504
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:09,520
right that will not be legal because you
 

2505
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,829
right that will not be legal because you
can't do a matrix multiply uh to compute

2506
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:11,839
can't do a matrix multiply uh to compute
 

2507
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:23,109
can't do a matrix multiply uh to compute
that norm but yes norms the right kind

2508
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:23,119

 

2509
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,309

um I'll write one down that's uh

2510
00:56:26,309 --> 00:56:26,319
um I'll write one down that's uh
 

2511
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,390
um I'll write one down that's uh
basically the same as sum but we'll

2512
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:28,400
basically the same as sum but we'll
 

2513
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,829
basically the same as sum but we'll
treat it slightly differently because

2514
00:56:29,829 --> 00:56:29,839
treat it slightly differently because
 

2515
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:32,309
treat it slightly differently because
we're allowed to is the n so we can do

2516
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:32,319
we're allowed to is the n so we can do
 

2517
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:35,430
we're allowed to is the n so we can do
an average. Um

2518
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:35,440
an average. Um
 

2519
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,870
an average. Um
but uh okay uh more anyone more choices.

2520
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:40,880
but uh okay uh more anyone more choices.
 

2521
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,270
but uh okay uh more anyone more choices.
>> Yeah.

2522
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
>> Yeah.
 

2523
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,789
>> Yeah.
>> Could you find the variance too?

2524
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:42,799
>> Could you find the variance too?
 

2525
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,870
>> Could you find the variance too?
>> Variance. Yeah. Because that's like

2526
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:44,880
>> Variance. Yeah. Because that's like
 

2527
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,349
>> Variance. Yeah. Because that's like
average and then other things that are

2528
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:47,359
average and then other things that are
 

2529
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,430
average and then other things that are
built off of average of another thing

2530
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,440
built off of average of another thing
 

2531
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,870
built off of average of another thing
that's uses the average. Good. Yeah.

2532
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:52,880
that's uses the average. Good. Yeah.
 

2533
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,230
that's uses the average. Good. Yeah.
>> Mode.

2534
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:54,240
>> Mode.
 

2535
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,390
>> Mode.
>> Um sure. Let's call mode in this mix in

2536
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:58,400
>> Um sure. Let's call mode in this mix in
 

2537
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,950
>> Um sure. Let's call mode in this mix in
the same family as this. Yeah. Mode type

2538
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:00,960
the same family as this. Yeah. Mode type
 

2539
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,109
the same family as this. Yeah. Mode type
stuff. Yeah.

2540
00:57:03,109 --> 00:57:03,119

00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:03,920
>> Yeah.
 

2543
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,430
>> Yeah.
>> Like the I don't have to call it like

2544
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:05,440
>> Like the I don't have to call it like
 

2545
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,870
>> Like the I don't have to call it like
the cardality but like the number of

2546
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:06,880
the cardality but like the number of
 

2547
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,870
the cardality but like the number of
unique items.

2548
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:08,880
unique items.
 

2549
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,549
unique items.
>> Sure. Good. Number of unique items.

2550
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:10,559
>> Sure. Good. Number of unique items.
 

2551
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:17,430
>> Sure. Good. Number of unique items.
Yeah. Count unique. Yeah.

2552
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:17,440

 

2553
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,630

These are all valid choices.

2554
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:20,640
These are all valid choices.
 

2555
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,430
These are all valid choices.
>> Yeah.

2556
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:21,440
>> Yeah.
 

2557
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,510
>> Yeah.
>> We have another another like learnable

2558
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:23,520
>> We have another another like learnable
 

2559
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,950
>> We have another another like learnable
function.

2560
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:24,960
function.
 

2561
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,390
function.
So we we want to have learnable

2562
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:26,400
So we we want to have learnable
 

2563
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,670
So we we want to have learnable
functions. Okay, remember the big

2564
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:27,680
functions. Okay, remember the big
 

2565
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,150
functions. Okay, remember the big
picture. The big picture is when we make

2566
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:30,160
picture. The big picture is when we make
 

2567
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,710
picture. The big picture is when we make
a neural net making a neural net is our

00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,030
a neural net making a neural net is our
answer to I don't know what to do. I

2570
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:35,040
answer to I don't know what to do. I
 

2571
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,030
answer to I don't know what to do. I
want to make it learnable. However, to

2572
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:37,040
want to make it learnable. However, to
 

2573
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,150
want to make it learnable. However, to
make it learnable, I have to make an

2574
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:38,160
make it learnable, I have to make an
 

2575
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,670
make it learnable, I have to make an
architecture and I have to make certain

2576
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:39,680
architecture and I have to make certain
 

2577
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,150
architecture and I have to make certain
choices in my architecture and I in

2578
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:42,160
choices in my architecture and I in

00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,309
choices in my architecture and I in
neural net language we usually want to

2580
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:44,319
neural net language we usually want to
 

2581
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,069
neural net language we usually want to
make all the learnable parameter be

2582
00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:46,079
make all the learnable parameter be
 

2583
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,710
make all the learnable parameter be
weights or biases of some kind or things

2584
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:48,720
weights or biases of some kind or things
 

2585
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,470
weights or biases of some kind or things
some a few other families of things that

2586
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:50,480
some a few other families of things that
 

2587
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,870
some a few other families of things that
we also consider learnable parameters.

2588
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:52,880
we also consider learnable parameters.
 

2589
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,349
we also consider learnable parameters.
So saying I want to make it learnable

2590
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:55,359
So saying I want to make it learnable
 

2591
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:56,710
So saying I want to make it learnable
doesn't answer the question that we're

2592
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:56,720
doesn't answer the question that we're
 

2593
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,069
doesn't answer the question that we're
trying to answer here which is what are

2594
00:57:58,069 --> 00:57:58,079
trying to answer here which is what are
 

2595
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,710
trying to answer here which is what are
the kind of basic forms we can use out

2596
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,720
the kind of basic forms we can use out
 

2597
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,190
the kind of basic forms we can use out
of which we can make learnable things.

2598
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,200

 

2599
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,990

>> Yeah I have a question just so we're

2600
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:08,000
>> Yeah I have a question just so we're
 

2601
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,549
>> Yeah I have a question just so we're
doing this for each output channel but

2602
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:10,559
doing this for each output channel but
 

2603
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,589
doing this for each output channel but
then the inputs H's may have many

2604
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:13,599
then the inputs H's may have many
 

2605
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,589
then the inputs H's may have many
channels but they're all the same right

2606
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:15,599
channels but they're all the same right
 

2607
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,109
channels but they're all the same right
like H self and H all of your edges can

2608
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:19,119
like H self and H all of your edges can
 

2609
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:21,270
like H self and H all of your edges can
have multiple items per H right?

2610
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:21,280
have multiple items per H right?
 

2611
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,030
have multiple items per H right?
>> Yes. All of the hes are vectors of some

2612
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,040
>> Yes. All of the hes are vectors of some
 

2613
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,309
>> Yes. All of the hes are vectors of some
dimensionality, but the dimensionality

2614
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:24,319
dimensionality, but the dimensionality
 

2615
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,990
dimensionality, but the dimensionality
is the same. We're doing this for every

2616
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,000
is the same. We're doing this for every
 

2617
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,870
is the same. We're doing this for every
output channel.

2618
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:26,880
output channel.
 

2619
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,430
output channel.
>> Okay.

2620
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,440
>> Okay.
 

2621
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,470
>> Okay.
>> Yeah.

2622
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:28,480
>> Yeah.
 

2623
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,589
>> Yeah.
>> Could you look at things like

2624
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:29,599
>> Could you look at things like
 

2625
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,910
>> Could you look at things like
correlation with itself maybe or

2626
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:31,920
correlation with itself maybe or
 

2627
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,950
correlation with itself maybe or
something like that?

2628
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:32,960
something like that?
 

2629
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,470
something like that?
>> Yes, you can do correlations with self.

2630
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:34,480
>> Yes, you can do correlations with self.
 

2631
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,589
>> Yes, you can do correlations with self.
So, we'll come back to that. Uh yeah, so

2632
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:37,599
So, we'll come back to that. Uh yeah, so
 

2633
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,270
So, we'll come back to that. Uh yeah, so
we'll come back to that. Uh

2634
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:41,280
we'll come back to that. Uh
 

2635
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:51,270
we'll come back to that. Uh
I'll make that a special letter.

2636
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:51,280

 

2637
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,950

because that correlation with self

2638
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:52,960
because that correlation with self
 

2639
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,510
because that correlation with self
doesn't fall into this format here. I'm

2640
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:55,520
doesn't fall into this format here. I'm
 

2641
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,990
doesn't fall into this format here. I'm
really talking about replacing this guy.

2642
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
really talking about replacing this guy.
 

2643
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,349
really talking about replacing this guy.
Okay, but that we'll talk about that in

2644
00:58:59,349 --> 00:58:59,359
Okay, but that we'll talk about that in
 

2645
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,150
Okay, but that we'll talk about that in
a moment. Um,

2646
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:02,160
a moment. Um,
 

2647
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,789
a moment. Um,
so uh

2648
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:04,799
so uh
 

2649
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,710
so uh
I want to point out uh something that

2650
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:06,720
I want to point out uh something that
 

2651
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,150
I want to point out uh something that
you might not have thought about as

2652
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:08,160
you might not have thought about as
 

2653
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,390
you might not have thought about as
being permutation invariant, but it is

2654
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,400
being permutation invariant, but it is
 

2655
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,710
being permutation invariant, but it is
permutation invariant. Uh we're going to

2656
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:12,720
permutation invariant. Uh we're going to
 

2657
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,789
permutation invariant. Uh we're going to
do le squares.

2658
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:14,799
do le squares.
 

2659
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,349
do le squares.
So

2660
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:17,359
So
 

2661
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,990
So
magic trick

2662
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:20,000
magic trick
 

2663
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,710
magic trick
every time you see average ask yourself

2664
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:22,720
every time you see average ask yourself
 

2665
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,549
every time you see average ask yourself
who's average is big brother right le

2666
00:59:26,549 --> 00:59:26,559
who's average is big brother right le
 

2667
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,390
who's average is big brother right le
squares

2668
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:28,400
squares
 

2669
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,349
squares
right le squares is like an average in

2670
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:31,359
right le squares is like an average in
 

2671
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,950
right le squares is like an average in
spirit

2672
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:32,960
spirit
 

2673
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,230
spirit
so le squares thought of as a single

2674
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,240
so le squares thought of as a single
 

2675
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,630
so le squares thought of as a single
object that takes xy pairs and computes

2676
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:40,640
object that takes xy pairs and computes
 

2677
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,549
object that takes xy pairs and computes
a matrix to apply

2678
00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:44,559
a matrix to apply
 

2679
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:45,750
a matrix to apply
Le squares doesn't care about the

2680
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:45,760
Le squares doesn't care about the
 

2681
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,549
Le squares doesn't care about the
ordering.

2682
00:59:48,549 --> 00:59:48,559
ordering.
 

2683
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,630
ordering.
Everyone see this?

2684
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:50,640
Everyone see this?
 

2685
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,069
Everyone see this?
The order of the inputs doesn't matter

2686
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:52,079
The order of the inputs doesn't matter
 

2687
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,910
The order of the inputs doesn't matter
to le squares. So all of le squares is a

2688
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:55,920
to le squares. So all of le squares is a
 

2689
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,589
to le squares. So all of le squares is a
choice of something that's permutation

2690
00:59:57,589 --> 00:59:57,599
choice of something that's permutation
 

2691
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:09,829
choice of something that's permutation
invariant.

2692
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:09,839

 

2693
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,190

as a block. But once le squares is in

2694
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:13,200
as a block. But once le squares is in
 

2695
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,910
as a block. But once le squares is in
all ML

2696
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:15,920
all ML
 

2697
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,390
all ML
is in,

2698
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:18,400
is in,
 

2699
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,470
is in,
right? Did you see that everyone le

2700
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:22,480
right? Did you see that everyone le
 

2701
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,309
right? Did you see that everyone le
squares is one example you know le

2702
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:24,319
squares is one example you know le
 

2703
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:25,750
squares is one example you know le
squares. So this is like you have to

2704
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:25,760
squares. So this is like you have to
 

2705
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,750
squares. So this is like you have to
have build these conceptual connections

2706
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:27,760
have build these conceptual connections
 

2707
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,390
have build these conceptual connections
in your mind. It helps you. Okay. You

2708
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:30,400
in your mind. It helps you. Okay. You
 

2709
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,190
in your mind. It helps you. Okay. You
know averaging is like le squares but le

2710
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:33,200
know averaging is like le squares but le
 

2711
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,990
know averaging is like le squares but le
squares is the root of like all ML. So

2712
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,000
squares is the root of like all ML. So
 

2713
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,150
squares is the root of like all ML. So
nearest neighbors

2714
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,160
nearest neighbors
 

2715
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,750
nearest neighbors
kernel methods everything that has the

01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:41,760
kernel methods everything that has the
 

2717
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,069
kernel methods everything that has the
flavor like you can think of as being I

2718
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:44,079
flavor like you can think of as being I
 

2719
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,510
flavor like you can think of as being I
treat things as a bunch of training

2720
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:45,520
treat things as a bunch of training
 

2721
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,270
treat things as a bunch of training
data. You don't care about the ordering

2722
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,280
data. You don't care about the ordering
 

2723
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:53,190
data. You don't care about the ordering
of the training data. All of that is in

2724
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:53,200

 

2725
01:00:53,200 --> 01:01:07,589

this is a huge family.

2726
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:07,599

 

2727
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,789

Okay. Um, another thing that you should

2728
01:01:10,789 --> 01:01:10,799
Okay. Um, another thing that you should
 

2729
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,150
Okay. Um, another thing that you should
be thinking about is if you have a bunch

2730
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
be thinking about is if you have a bunch
 

2731
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,309
be thinking about is if you have a bunch
of numbers,

2732
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:16,319
of numbers,
 

2733
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:21,190
of numbers,
you can do soft maxes.

2734
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:21,200

 

2735
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,190

A softmax operation takes a bunch of

2736
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:23,200
A softmax operation takes a bunch of
 

2737
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,069
A softmax operation takes a bunch of
numbers and turns them into things that

2738
01:01:26,069 --> 01:01:26,079
numbers and turns them into things that
 

2739
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,549
numbers and turns them into things that
look like probabilities.

2740
01:01:28,549 --> 01:01:28,559
look like probabilities.
 

2741
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,589
look like probabilities.
It doesn't care about the order,

2742
01:01:31,589 --> 01:01:31,599
It doesn't care about the order,
 

2743
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,910
It doesn't care about the order,
but it kind of it gives you back the

2744
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:33,920
but it kind of it gives you back the
 

2745
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,589
but it kind of it gives you back the
same things counterparts for every

2746
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:35,599
same things counterparts for every
 

2747
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,109
same things counterparts for every
single thing. So you can also build

2748
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:37,119
single thing. So you can also build
 

2749
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,270
single thing. So you can also build
things out of using softmaxes in this

2750
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:39,280
things out of using softmaxes in this
 

2751
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,030
things out of using softmaxes in this
picture.

2752
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:43,040

 

2753
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,270

Okay. So you think okay wow

2754
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:47,280
Okay. So you think okay wow
 

2755
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,510
Okay. So you think okay wow
once you start asking yourself what kind

2756
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:49,520
once you start asking yourself what kind
 

2757
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,750
once you start asking yourself what kind
of things you can do you have a a pretty

2758
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:51,760
of things you can do you have a a pretty
 

2759
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,270
of things you can do you have a a pretty
rich vocabulary of stuff that's

2760
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:53,280
rich vocabulary of stuff that's
 

2761
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,510
rich vocabulary of stuff that's
permutation invariant. So now we're

2762
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:55,520
permutation invariant. So now we're
 

2763
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,990
permutation invariant. So now we're
going to keep going. Okay. Yes.

2764
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,000
going to keep going. Okay. Yes.

2775
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,950
an object like this you can think of it
as this. For example, for le squares,

as this. For example, for le squares,
 

2777
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,710

you could say, fine, what I'm going to
do is I'm gonna have a function,

do is I'm gonna have a function,
 

2781
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,309
do is I'm gonna have a function,
learnable function that takes the input

they didn't have to think about what

other general forms I might want
 

2825
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,430
other general forms I might want
necessarily. But in the GNN community,

2826
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:15,440
necessarily. But in the GNN community,
 

2827
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,029
necessarily. But in the GNN community,
because you had this constraint of

2828
01:03:17,029 --> 01:03:17,039
because you had this constraint of
 

2829
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,230
because you had this constraint of
undirected edges, you had to think of

2830
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:20,240
undirected edges, you had to think of
 

2831
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,750
undirected edges, you had to think of
what your actual design flexibility was

2832
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:23,760
what your actual design flexibility was
 

2833
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,309
what your actual design flexibility was

So it turns out that even this format is

2836
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:33,119
So it turns out that even this format is
 

2837
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,150
So it turns out that even this format is
not the most general that you can get

2838
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:36,160
not the most general that you can get
 

2839
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,549
not the most general that you can get
because as was mentioned there is this

2840
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:38,559
because as was mentioned there is this
 

2841
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:43,349
because as was mentioned there is this
correlations with self idea

2842

01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:47,359
which said why in this picture why am I
 

2845

not using myself in this function.

2846
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:51,440

2847
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:57,829

01:03:57,829 --> 01:03:57,839

 

2849
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:00,470

So if everyone can see here, we can have

So if everyone can see here, we can have
 

2851
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,630
So if everyone can see here, we can have
a function that acts on myself and then

2852
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:04,640
a function that acts on myself and then
 

2853
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,309
a function that acts on myself and then
some some like thing, which of course is

2859
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,789
that takes not just a learnable function
of the stuff that's coming from my

2860
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:14,799
of the stuff that's coming from my
 

2861
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:26,390
of the stuff that's coming from my
neighbor, but also myself.

2862
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:26,400

 

2863
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,270

Okay, so here's for example, so you

2864
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:29,280
Okay, so here's for example, so you
 

2865
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,190
Okay, so here's for example, so you
might think this is hard to think about.

2866
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:33,200
might think this is hard to think about.
 

2867
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,069
might think this is hard to think about.
This is very general. So how can I think

2868
01:04:36,069 --> 01:04:36,079
This is very general. So how can I think
 

2869
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,750
This is very general. So how can I think
about this? How might I want to use

2870
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:39,760
about this? How might I want to use
 

2871
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,390
about this? How might I want to use
information about myself together with

2872
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:42,400
information about myself together with
 

2873
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,789
information about myself together with
the neighbor?

2874
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:44,799
the neighbor?
 

2875
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,190
the neighbor?
Does everyone see this as a like how do

2876
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:47,200
Does everyone see this as a like how do
 

2877
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,349
Does everyone see this as a like how do
you think about it? And the fact that

2878
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:51,359
you think about it? And the fact that
 

2879
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,069
you think about it? And the fact that
you've studied machine learning says

2880
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:54,079
you've studied machine learning says
 

2881
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:56,870
you've studied machine learning says
that well I actually do have one kind of

2882
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:56,880
that well I actually do have one kind of
 

2883
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,710
that well I actually do have one kind of
way that I'm used to thinking about

2884
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:58,720
way that I'm used to thinking about
 

2885
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,430
way that I'm used to thinking about
this. I'm used to thinking about this

2886
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:01,440
this. I'm used to thinking about this
 

2887
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,190
this. I'm used to thinking about this
for example when I take the kernel

2888
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,200
for example when I take the kernel
 

2889
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,710
for example when I take the kernel
perspective on regression problems or

2890
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:06,720
perspective on regression problems or
 

2891
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,430
perspective on regression problems or
classification problems.

2892
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
classification problems.
 

2893
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,870
classification problems.
So when you take the kernel this is not

2894
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:10,880
So when you take the kernel this is not
 

2895
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,390
So when you take the kernel this is not
the convolutional kernel kernel this is

2896
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:12,400
the convolutional kernel kernel this is
 

2897
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,630
the convolutional kernel kernel this is
kernels and kernel methods kernel. If I

2898
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:14,640
kernels and kernel methods kernel. If I
 

2899
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,789
kernels and kernel methods kernel. If I
take the kernel uh kernelized

2900
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:16,799
take the kernel uh kernelized
 

2901
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,870
take the kernel uh kernelized
perspective, the kernelized perspective

2902
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:18,880
perspective, the kernelized perspective
 

2903
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,710
perspective, the kernelized perspective
says

2904
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:20,720
says
 

2905
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,150
says
easiest to think about even from the

2906
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:22,160
easiest to think about even from the
 

2907
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,390
easiest to think about even from the
nearest neighbor point of view, how

2908
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:24,400
nearest neighbor point of view, how
 

2909
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,870
nearest neighbor point of view, how
should I predict what happens here? Let

2910
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:26,880
should I predict what happens here? Let
 

2911
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,549
should I predict what happens here? Let
me look at points that are like me. What

2912
01:05:30,549 --> 01:05:30,559
me look at points that are like me. What
 

2913
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,670
me look at points that are like me. What
did they do? They did this. I should do

2914
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,680
did they do? They did this. I should do
 

2915
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,670
did they do? They did this. I should do
something similar. Right? That's the

2916
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:35,680
something similar. Right? That's the
 

2917
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,589
something similar. Right? That's the
nearest neighbor point of view. And

2918
01:05:37,589 --> 01:05:37,599
nearest neighbor point of view. And
 

2919
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,510
nearest neighbor point of view. And
that's the kernelized perspective. More

2920
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:39,520
that's the kernelized perspective. More
 

2921
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,670
that's the kernelized perspective. More
generally, it says you compute some kind

2922
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:41,680
generally, it says you compute some kind
 

2923
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,950
generally, it says you compute some kind
of similarity between points and you use

2924
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:44,960
of similarity between points and you use
 

2925
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,470
of similarity between points and you use
that to interpret and weigh what that

2926
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:48,480
that to interpret and weigh what that
 

2927
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,109
that to interpret and weigh what that
particular point is predicting.

2928
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:51,119
particular point is predicting.
 

2929
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,710
particular point is predicting.
Everyone with me? So as in terms of math

2930
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:54,720
Everyone with me? So as in terms of math
 

2931
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,230
Everyone with me? So as in terms of math
format

2932
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:56,240
format
 

2933
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,190
format
inspired by kernel methods,

2934
01:05:59,190 --> 01:05:59,200
inspired by kernel methods,
 

2935
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,630
inspired by kernel methods,
you can think about something that looks

2936
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:00,640
you can think about something that looks
 

2937
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,430
you can think about something that looks
like this.

2938
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:03,440
like this.
 

2939
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,230
like this.
So what's happening here is we're saying

2940
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:06,240
So what's happening here is we're saying
 

2941
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,150
So what's happening here is we're saying
look

2942
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:08,160
look
 

2943
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,390
look
we're going to take a sum of some

2944
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:10,400
we're going to take a sum of some
 

2945
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,029
we're going to take a sum of some
learned similarity measure between me

2946
01:06:13,029 --> 01:06:13,039
learned similarity measure between me
 

2947
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,589
learned similarity measure between me
and a point and then some other learned

2948
01:06:15,589 --> 01:06:15,599
and a point and then some other learned
 

2949
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:19,349
and a point and then some other learned
thing about that point.

2950
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:19,359

 

2951
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,430

I guess I could

2952
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:21,440
I guess I could
 

2953
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:27,270
I guess I could
be consistent.

2954
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:27,280

 

2955
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,750

So I'm pause here. Does everyone see the

2956
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:29,760
So I'm pause here. Does everyone see the
 

2957
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,150
So I'm pause here. Does everyone see the
kind of thought process journey that's

2958
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:32,160
kind of thought process journey that's
 

2959
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,829
kind of thought process journey that's
very natural from a machine learning

2960
01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:33,839
very natural from a machine learning
 

2961
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,390
very natural from a machine learning
point of view that brings you to

2962
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:36,400
point of view that brings you to
 

2963
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,390
point of view that brings you to
something like this as a kind of generic

2964
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:38,400
something like this as a kind of generic
 

2965
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,510
something like this as a kind of generic
form that you might want to do

2966
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:41,520
form that you might want to do
 

2967
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,910
form that you might want to do
and we have also the understanding we

2968
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:43,920
and we have also the understanding we
 

2969
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,349
and we have also the understanding we
brought all these other things around.

2970
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:45,359
brought all these other things around.
 

2971
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:47,029
brought all these other things around.
Yeah. Question

2972
01:06:47,029 --> 01:06:47,039
Yeah. Question
 

2973
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,270
Yeah. Question
>> what does S

2974
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:49,280
>> what does S
 

2975
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,109
>> what does S
function

2976
01:06:51,109 --> 01:06:51,119
function
 

2977
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,109
function
what does it do? Ah, so this S I wrote

2978
01:06:55,109 --> 01:06:55,119
what does it do? Ah, so this S I wrote
 

2979
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:58,950
what does it do? Ah, so this S I wrote
here I said was inspired by the idea of

2980
01:06:58,950 --> 01:06:58,960
here I said was inspired by the idea of
 

2981
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,950
here I said was inspired by the idea of
some kind of similarity measure between

2982
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:00,960
some kind of similarity measure between
 

2983
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,230
some kind of similarity measure between
two things and I wanted to be learned.

2984
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,240
two things and I wanted to be learned.
 

2985
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,470
two things and I wanted to be learned.
So for a similarity measure,

2986
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:08,480
So for a similarity measure,
 

2987
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,349
So for a similarity measure,
okay, for a random variable, your go-to

2988
01:07:11,349 --> 01:07:11,359
okay, for a random variable, your go-to
 

2989
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:15,430
okay, for a random variable, your go-to
distributions are Gaussian and uniform.

2990
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:15,440
distributions are Gaussian and uniform.
 

2991
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,510
distributions are Gaussian and uniform.
Okay, for a norm, your go-to norm is two

2992
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:19,520
Okay, for a norm, your go-to norm is two
 

2993
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,309
Okay, for a norm, your go-to norm is two
norm. And if that doesn't work, maybe

2994
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:22,319
norm. And if that doesn't work, maybe
 

2995
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,549
norm. And if that doesn't work, maybe
look at one norm or infinity norm. You

2996
01:07:24,549 --> 01:07:24,559
look at one norm or infinity norm. You
 

2997
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:26,630
look at one norm or infinity norm. You
have like set of usual suspects, okay,

2998
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:26,640
have like set of usual suspects, okay,
 

2999
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,870
have like set of usual suspects, okay,
in your mind. Okay, for similarity

3000
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:28,880
in your mind. Okay, for similarity
 

3001
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,109
in your mind. Okay, for similarity
measure, what's your go-to similarity

3002
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:31,119
measure, what's your go-to similarity
 

3003
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,230
measure, what's your go-to similarity
measure?

3004
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:32,240
measure?
 

3005
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,109
measure?
>> Inner product.

3006
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:33,119
>> Inner product.
 

3007
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,190
>> Inner product.
>> Inner product.

3008
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:35,200
>> Inner product.
 

3009
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,549
>> Inner product.
Okay, and if you want to make it

3010
01:07:36,549 --> 01:07:36,559
Okay, and if you want to make it
 

3011
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,630
Okay, and if you want to make it
learned, you're like, fine, I want to

3012
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:38,640
learned, you're like, fine, I want to
 

3013
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,470
learned, you're like, fine, I want to
learn similarity measure. I'll make

3014
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:40,480
learn similarity measure. I'll make
 

3015
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,470
learn similarity measure. I'll make
matrices

3016
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:42,480
matrices
 

3017
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,230
matrices
modulating the two things and then I'll

3018
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:44,240
modulating the two things and then I'll
 

3019
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,990
modulating the two things and then I'll
take their inner product. Does everyone

3020
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:46,000
take their inner product. Does everyone
 

3021
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,750
take their inner product. Does everyone
see that? Like this is just like like a

3022
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:47,760
see that? Like this is just like like a
 

3023
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,750
see that? Like this is just like like a
list in your mind of like complexity of

3024
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:49,760
list in your mind of like complexity of
 

3025
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,150
list in your mind of like complexity of
stuff and this is like go for the

3026
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:52,160
stuff and this is like go for the
 

3027
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,670
stuff and this is like go for the
easiest thing first. So that's always

3028
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:53,680
easiest thing first. So that's always
 

3029
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,309
easiest thing first. So that's always
the way we work in machine learning in

3030
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:56,319
the way we work in machine learning in
 

3031
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,470
the way we work in machine learning in
deep learning. Try something. What

3032
01:07:58,470 --> 01:07:58,480
deep learning. Try something. What
 

3033
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,230
deep learning. Try something. What
should I try? Try the easiest thing

3034
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:00,240
should I try? Try the easiest thing
 

3035
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,829
should I try? Try the easiest thing
first. Does it work? If yes, great. If

3036
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:03,839
first. Does it work? If yes, great. If
 

3037
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:07,430
first. Does it work? If yes, great. If
not, try the next harder thing.

3038
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:07,440
not, try the next harder thing.
 

3039
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,430
not, try the next harder thing.
Everyone with me?

3040
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:09,440
Everyone with me?
 

3041
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,589
Everyone with me?
Okay.

3042
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:11,599
Okay.
 

3043
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,270
Okay.
So there's one more kind of thinking

3044
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:15,280
So there's one more kind of thinking
 

3045
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,789
So there's one more kind of thinking
that you have when you look at something

3046
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:16,799
that you have when you look at something
 

3047
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,510
that you have when you look at something
like this. So it's all about connecting

3048
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:19,520
like this. So it's all about connecting
 

3049
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,110
like this. So it's all about connecting
patterns in your mind. Yeah.

3050
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:21,120
patterns in your mind. Yeah.
 

3051
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,749
patterns in your mind. Yeah.
>> So essentially is introducing this

3052
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:23,759
>> So essentially is introducing this
 

3053
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:26,390

similarity like function just a more

3054
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:26,400
similarity like function just a more
 

3055
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,990
similarity like function just a more
strategic version of having just an

3056
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:28,000
strategic version of having just an
 

3057
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,950
strategic version of having just an
arbitrary function between um the self

3058
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:30,960
arbitrary function between um the self
 

3059
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,709
arbitrary function between um the self
node and the neighbor.

3060
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:32,719
node and the neighbor.
 

3061
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,349
node and the neighbor.
>> Um exactly. So here we have an arbitrary

3062
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:35,359
>> Um exactly. So here we have an arbitrary
 

3063
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,030
>> Um exactly. So here we have an arbitrary
function but I don't know how to think

3064
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,040
function but I don't know how to think
 

3065
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,669
function but I don't know how to think
about arbitrary functions. So we need to

3066
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:39,679
about arbitrary functions. So we need to
 

3067
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,189
about arbitrary functions. So we need to
think about families. There's too much

3068
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:41,199
think about families. There's too much
 

3069
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:43,990
think about families. There's too much
generality here. So because I want to

3070
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:44,000
generality here. So because I want to
 

3071
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,990
generality here. So because I want to
build a building block, I want to think

3072
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:46,000
build a building block, I want to think
 

3073
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,990
build a building block, I want to think
about something that I might want to

3074
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:48,000
about something that I might want to
 

3075
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,189
about something that I might want to
use. What might you want to use?

3076
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:51,199
use. What might you want to use?
 

3077
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:52,630
use. What might you want to use?
Something that might have already been

3078
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
Something that might have already been
 

3079
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,630
Something that might have already been
useful. So if something was useful

3080
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:54,640
useful. So if something was useful
 

3081
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,470
useful. So if something was useful
somewhere, odds are it might be useful

3082
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:56,480
somewhere, odds are it might be useful
 

3083
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,709
somewhere, odds are it might be useful
somewhere else.

3084
01:08:58,709 --> 01:08:58,719
somewhere else.
 

3085
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,789
somewhere else.
And so we know from kernels kernel

3086
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:00,799
And so we know from kernels kernel
 

3087
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,709
And so we know from kernels kernel
methods that thinking about things in

3088
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:02,719
methods that thinking about things in
 

3089
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,669
methods that thinking about things in
terms of similarities and something is a

3090
01:09:05,669 --> 01:09:05,679
terms of similarities and something is a
 

3091
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,189
terms of similarities and something is a
good way to think about coupled

3092
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:07,199
good way to think about coupled
 

3093
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,470
good way to think about coupled
functions. So let's just do that.

3094
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,480
functions. So let's just do that.
 

3095
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,749
functions. So let's just do that.
What I'm trying to show here is that

3096
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:11,759
What I'm trying to show here is that
 

3097
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,390
What I'm trying to show here is that
this kind of thinking isn't

3098
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,400
this kind of thinking isn't
 

3099
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,229
this kind of thinking isn't
hard.

3100
01:09:16,229 --> 01:09:16,239
hard.
 

3101
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:19,269
hard.
It's just looking and saying, "What are

3102
01:09:19,269 --> 01:09:19,279
It's just looking and saying, "What are
 

3103
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:21,110
It's just looking and saying, "What are
my list of choices?" It's kind of just

3104
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:21,120
my list of choices?" It's kind of just
 

3105
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,189
my list of choices?" It's kind of just
systematically going through stuff

3106
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:23,199
systematically going through stuff
 

3107
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:26,470
systematically going through stuff
you've seen.

3108
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:26,480

 

3109
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,070

The next thing when you observe

3110
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:28,080
The next thing when you observe
 

3111
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,910
The next thing when you observe
something like this, yeah,

3112
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:29,920
something like this, yeah,
 

3113
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,510
something like this, yeah,
>> should we have the H0 in the argument of

we put H0 inside this? And the answer is

3120
01:09:41,349 --> 01:09:41,359
we put H0 inside this? And the answer is
 

3121
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:46,229
we put H0 inside this? And the answer is
no. Okay, why no? Because if we we

3122
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:46,239
no. Okay, why no? Because if we we
 

3123
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,149
no. Okay, why no? Because if we we
started with this and we said we don't

3124
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:48,159
started with this and we said we don't
 

3125
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,390
started with this and we said we don't
know how to think about this. So we want

3126
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:50,400
know how to think about this. So we want
 

3127
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,390
know how to think about this. So we want
to go to something simpler that we can

3128
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,400
to go to something simpler that we can
 

3129
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,550
to go to something simpler that we can
think about. So it's an odd kind of

3130
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:54,560
think about. So it's an odd kind of
 

3131
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,709
think about. So it's an odd kind of
simplicity that makes something longer

3132
01:09:56,709 --> 01:09:56,719
simplicity that makes something longer
 

3133
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:59,510
simplicity that makes something longer
but it's still simpler. Okay. The reason

3134
01:09:59,510 --> 01:09:59,520
but it's still simpler. Okay. The reason
 

3135
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,550
but it's still simpler. Okay. The reason
is this. I say general function. I don't

3136
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:02,560
is this. I say general function. I don't
 

3137
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,669
is this. I say general function. I don't
know how to think about general

3138
01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:03,679
know how to think about general
 

3139
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,750
know how to think about general
functions.

3140
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:05,760
functions.
 

3141
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,990
functions.
Here I'm saying similarity like

3142
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:08,000
Here I'm saying similarity like
 

3143
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,229
Here I'm saying similarity like
functions

3144
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:10,239
functions
 

3145
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,709
functions
and general function of one thing. So

3146
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:12,719
and general function of one thing. So
 

3147
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,870
and general function of one thing. So
it's simpler because general function of

3148
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
it's simpler because general function of
 

3149
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,709
it's simpler because general function of
one thing I have a go-to thing MLP

3150
01:10:16,709 --> 01:10:16,719
one thing I have a go-to thing MLP
 

3151
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,510
one thing I have a go-to thing MLP
something right

3152
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:19,520
something right
 

3153
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,950
something right
similarity functions I can start

3154
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:20,960
similarity functions I can start
 

3155
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,070
similarity functions I can start
thinking of how I might build a

3156
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:22,080
thinking of how I might build a
 

3157
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,590
thinking of how I might build a
similarity function. Namely I can use an

3158
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:23,600
similarity function. Namely I can use an
 

3159
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,630
similarity function. Namely I can use an
inner product. I have different

3160
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:24,640
inner product. I have different
 

3161
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,590
inner product. I have different
different things I would go to to do it.

3162
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:27,600
different things I would go to to do it.
 

3163
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,189
different things I would go to to do it.
That's why this we don't put

3164
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:31,199
That's why this we don't put
 

3165
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,270
That's why this we don't put
this here. It would be legal to we could

3166
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:33,280
this here. It would be legal to we could
 

3167
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,390
this here. It would be legal to we could
put H0 here. It's not that it's not an

3168
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:36,400
put H0 here. It's not that it's not an
 

3169
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,550
put H0 here. It's not that it's not an
illegal move, but it's not the first

3170
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:38,560
illegal move, but it's not the first
 

3171
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,830
illegal move, but it's not the first
move we make.

3172
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:43,840

 

3173
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,189

Okay. So, one more observation that I

3174
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:47,199
Okay. So, one more observation that I
 

3175
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,990
Okay. So, one more observation that I
want to say you might have just looking

3176
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:50,000
want to say you might have just looking
 

3177
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,229
want to say you might have just looking
at it.

3178
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:52,239
at it.
 

3179
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:54,630
at it.
So

3180
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:54,640
So
 

3181
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,070
So
when you look at something like this,

3182
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:58,080
when you look at something like this,
 

3183
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:03,030
when you look at something like this,
whenever you see some something times

3184
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:03,040
whenever you see some something times
 

3185
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,189
whenever you see some something times
something else,

3186
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:05,199
something else,
 

3187
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:08,630
something else,
okay, in your mind that should be like

3188
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:08,640
okay, in your mind that should be like
 

3189
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,910
okay, in your mind that should be like
I've seen this kind of stuff before,

3190
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:11,920
I've seen this kind of stuff before,
 

3191
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,470
I've seen this kind of stuff before,
right? And you have lots of different

3192
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:14,480
right? And you have lots of different
 

3193
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,470
right? And you have lots of different
places. But whenever you see a sum,

3194
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:16,480
places. But whenever you see a sum,
 

3195
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,630
places. But whenever you see a sum,
something and something else, you might

3196
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:18,640
something and something else, you might
 

3197
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,229
something and something else, you might
think maybe this should be an

3198
01:11:20,229 --> 01:11:20,239
think maybe this should be an
 

3199
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,030
think maybe this should be an
expectation

3200
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:23,040
expectation
 

3201
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,270
expectation
because expectations look like that.

3202
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:25,280
because expectations look like that.
 

3203
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,070
because expectations look like that.
They look like sums of something times

3204
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:28,080
They look like sums of something times
 

3205
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,270
They look like sums of something times
something else.

3206
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:31,280
something else.
 

3207
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:35,350
something else.
Everyone with me? Okay. So this kind of

3208
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:35,360
Everyone with me? Okay. So this kind of
 

3209
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:39,270
Everyone with me? Okay. So this kind of
thinking should just prompt the thought

3210
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:39,280
thinking should just prompt the thought
 

3211
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:45,990
thinking should just prompt the thought
just a thought.

3212
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,000

 

3213
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,030

Should

3214
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:49,040

 

3215
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,550

this

3216
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:50,560
this
 

3217
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,229
this
be

3218
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:52,239
be
 

3219
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:57,510
be
an expectation?

3220
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:57,520

 

3221
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,950

Why might you want it to be an

3222
01:11:58,950 --> 01:11:58,960
Why might you want it to be an
 

3223
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,950
Why might you want it to be an
expectation? You might want it to be an

3224
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:00,960
expectation? You might want it to be an
 

3225
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,189
expectation? You might want it to be an
expectation because you know many things

3226
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:03,199
expectation because you know many things
 

3227
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,590
expectation because you know many things
about expectations. You also know they

3228
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:05,600
about expectations. You also know they
 

3229
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,030
about expectations. You also know they
might be controlled. Whenever you see a

3230
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:07,040
might be controlled. Whenever you see a
 

3231
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,430
might be controlled. Whenever you see a
sum, you might be worried about dynamic

3232
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:09,440
sum, you might be worried about dynamic
 

3233
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,990
sum, you might be worried about dynamic
range. It's getting big, small,

3234
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:12,000
range. It's getting big, small,
 

3235
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,430
range. It's getting big, small,
something. So you might think if I make

3236
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:13,440
something. So you might think if I make
 

3237
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,350
something. So you might think if I make
it an expectation, I know at least it

3238
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,360
it an expectation, I know at least it
 

3239
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,030
it an expectation, I know at least it
won't the number of things in it won't

3240
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:17,040
won't the number of things in it won't
 

3241
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,270
won't the number of things in it won't
change it too much. Does everyone see

3242
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:19,280
change it too much. Does everyone see
 

3243
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,990
change it too much. Does everyone see
that? And in neural net land, you're

3244
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:22,000
that? And in neural net land, you're
 

3245
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,550
that? And in neural net land, you're
always worried about normalization.

3246
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:24,560
always worried about normalization.
 

3247
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,990
always worried about normalization.
Is something going to become too big,

3248
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:26,000
Is something going to become too big,
 

3249
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,870
Is something going to become too big,
too small? That's really bad.

3250
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:28,880
too small? That's really bad.
 

3251
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,229
too small? That's really bad.
That's another reason why you might say

3252
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:30,239
That's another reason why you might say
 

3253
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:31,270
That's another reason why you might say
it would be nice if it was an

3254
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:31,280
it would be nice if it was an
 

3255
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,310
it would be nice if it was an
expectation. Everyone with me? Okay.

3256
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,320
expectation. Everyone with me? Okay.
 

3257
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,630
expectation. Everyone with me? Okay.
Now,

3258
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:36,640
Now,
 

3259
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,149
Now,
how do you turn things like this into

3260
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:40,159
how do you turn things like this into
 

3261
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:41,830
how do you turn things like this into
expectations?

3262
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:41,840
expectations?
 

3263
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,590
expectations?
You turn one of them into probabilities.

3264
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:45,600
You turn one of them into probabilities.
 

3265
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,350
You turn one of them into probabilities.
That's how you do it. So, you ask

3266
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,360
That's how you do it. So, you ask
 

3267
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,910
That's how you do it. So, you ask
yourself, okay, which one should I turn

3268
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:49,920
yourself, okay, which one should I turn
 

3269
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,430
yourself, okay, which one should I turn
into a probability?

3270
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:53,440

 

3271
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,270

So you go back to thinking about

3272
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:57,280
So you go back to thinking about
 

3273
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,830
So you go back to thinking about
nearest neighbors or something. Okay. So

3274
01:12:59,830 --> 01:12:59,840
nearest neighbors or something. Okay. So
 

3275
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,669
nearest neighbors or something. Okay. So
for nearest neighbors, what do you do?

3276
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:01,679
for nearest neighbors, what do you do?
 

3277
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,430
for nearest neighbors, what do you do?
You say nearest neighbor type thinking.

3278
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,440
You say nearest neighbor type thinking.
 

3279
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,630
You say nearest neighbor type thinking.
You say, "Okay, I'm here.

3280
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:06,640
You say, "Okay, I'm here.
 

3281
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,790
You say, "Okay, I'm here.
Who's nearby?

3282
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:08,800
Who's nearby?
 

3283
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,110
Who's nearby?
These are things that are nearby. I want

3284
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:11,120
These are things that are nearby. I want
 

3285
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,430
These are things that are nearby. I want
to take nearest neighbor regression. I

3286
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:13,440
to take nearest neighbor regression. I
 

3287
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,669
to take nearest neighbor regression. I
would like to take an average of these

3288
01:13:15,669 --> 01:13:15,679
would like to take an average of these
 

3289
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,830
would like to take an average of these
nearby things.

3290
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:17,840
nearby things.
 

3291
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,270
nearby things.
Everyone with me?" So now you say ah how

3292
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:21,280
Everyone with me?" So now you say ah how
 

3293
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:24,310
Everyone with me?" So now you say ah how
similar am I to all of these? Turn that

3294
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:24,320
similar am I to all of these? Turn that
 

3295
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,229
similar am I to all of these? Turn that
into a probability and weight it by what

3296
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:26,239
into a probability and weight it by what
 

3297
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,149
into a probability and weight it by what
they are.

3298
01:13:28,149 --> 01:13:28,159
they are.
 

3299
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:30,390
they are.
Everyone with me. So that's why you

3300
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:30,400
Everyone with me. So that's why you
 

3301
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,990
Everyone with me. So that's why you
should think ah the similarity is

3302
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:32,000
should think ah the similarity is
 

3303
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,950
should think ah the similarity is
probably the thing you might want to

3304
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:32,960
probably the thing you might want to
 

3305
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,149
probably the thing you might want to
turn into probabilities.

3306
01:13:36,149 --> 01:13:36,159
turn into probabilities.
 

3307
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:37,910
turn into probabilities.
So

3308
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:37,920
So
 

3309
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,910
So
how do you turn a bunch of numbers? So

3310
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
how do you turn a bunch of numbers? So
 

3311
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,669
how do you turn a bunch of numbers? So
again maybe I should even mark mark the

3312
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:43,679
again maybe I should even mark mark the
 

3313
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,630
again maybe I should even mark mark the
vector status of these things.

3314
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:48,640

 

3315
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,950

This can be a vector.

3316
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:50,960
This can be a vector.
 

3317
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,790
This can be a vector.
This in general up here is a vector,

3318
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:54,800
This in general up here is a vector,
 

3319
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,830
This in general up here is a vector,
right? This up here is a vector.

3320
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:57,840
right? This up here is a vector.
 

3321
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,430
right? This up here is a vector.
But similarity I should think of as

3322
01:13:59,430 --> 01:13:59,440
But similarity I should think of as
 

3323
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,430
But similarity I should think of as
being a scalar

3324
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:01,440
being a scalar
 

3325
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,310
being a scalar
like object.

3326
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:04,320
like object.
 

3327
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,830
like object.
So how do I turn a scalar type object a

3328
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:07,840
So how do I turn a scalar type object a
 

3329
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,550
So how do I turn a scalar type object a
bunch of them unsorted

3330
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:10,560
bunch of them unsorted
 

3331
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:16,229
bunch of them unsorted
into unordered into probabilities?

3332
01:14:16,229 --> 01:14:16,239
into unordered into probabilities?
 

3333
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:17,990
into unordered into probabilities?
Softmax.

3334
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,000
Softmax.
 

3335
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,750
Softmax.
I have a I have a go-to thing for doing

3336
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:19,760
I have a I have a go-to thing for doing
 

3337
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,110
I have a I have a go-to thing for doing
this. I do it all the time. So, I can do

3338
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:23,120
this. I do it all the time. So, I can do
 

3339
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:25,750
this. I do it all the time. So, I can do
this. So, let's put all the pieces

3340
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:25,760
this. So, let's put all the pieces
 

3341
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,430
this. So, let's put all the pieces
together.

3342
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:27,440
together.
 

3343
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,669
together.
Okay.

3344
01:14:29,669 --> 01:14:29,679
Okay.
 

3345
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,510
Okay.
Making them make take all these default

3346
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:31,520
Making them make take all these default
 

3347
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:36,550
Making them make take all these default
choices and just construct it.

3348
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:36,560

 

3349
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,910

Okay. So, design choices I'll use inner

3350
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:39,920
Okay. So, design choices I'll use inner
 

3351
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,070
Okay. So, design choices I'll use inner
product for similarity learned inner

3352
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,080
product for similarity learned inner
 

3353
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,070
product for similarity learned inner
product. To make a learned inner

3354
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:44,080
product. To make a learned inner
 

3355
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,510
product. To make a learned inner
product, I have to learn matrices

3356
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:45,520
product, I have to learn matrices
 

3357
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,390
product, I have to learn matrices
multiplying the two things.

3358
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:48,400
multiplying the two things.
 

3359
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,390
multiplying the two things.
I'll use expectation style for the sum,

3360
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:52,400
I'll use expectation style for the sum,
 

3361
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,310
I'll use expectation style for the sum,
some learned linear function. And I'll

3362
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:54,320
some learned linear function. And I'll
 

3363
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,709
some learned linear function. And I'll
use some MLP for the final combination

3364
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:56,719
use some MLP for the final combination
 

3365
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,870
use some MLP for the final combination
of stuff.

3366
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:00,880

 

3367
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,270

So I have to everyone with me like let's

3368
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,280
So I have to everyone with me like let's
 

3369
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,630
So I have to everyone with me like let's
just put this together like what kind of

3370
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:04,640
just put this together like what kind of
 

3371
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,550
just put this together like what kind of
thing do we get?

3372
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:08,560

 

3373
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,790

Here's what we get. Let's walk through

3374
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:10,800
Here's what we get. Let's walk through
 

3375
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,990
Here's what we get. Let's walk through
it.

3376
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:14,000

 

3377
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,470

So I take the stuff I get from the

3378
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:16,480
So I take the stuff I get from the
 

3379
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,189
So I take the stuff I get from the
previous layer, my H.

3380
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:19,199
previous layer, my H.
 

3381
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:20,390
previous layer, my H.
I know I'm going to have a residual

3382
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400
I know I'm going to have a residual
 

3383
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:26,550
I know I'm going to have a residual
block. So residual.

3384
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:26,560

 

3385
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,590

I know I should pre-normalize.

3386
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:29,600
I know I should pre-normalize.
 

3387
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,189
I know I should pre-normalize.
That was a design thing we told you

3388
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:31,199
That was a design thing we told you
 

3389
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,470
That was a design thing we told you
before. So I put a norm.

3390
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:34,480
before. So I put a norm.
 

3391
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:36,470
before. So I put a norm.
Now I want the learned inner product

3392
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:36,480
Now I want the learned inner product
 

3393
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,709
Now I want the learned inner product
between me and the other guys, my

3394
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
between me and the other guys, my
 

3395
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,550
between me and the other guys, my
neighboring information.

3396
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:40,560
neighboring information.
 

3397
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,550
neighboring information.
How do I learn inner product? I make

3398
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
How do I learn inner product? I make
 

3399
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,790
How do I learn inner product? I make
learnable matrices that multiply this

3400
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:44,800
learnable matrices that multiply this
 

3401
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:49,270
learnable matrices that multiply this
stuff and I take the inner product.

3402
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:49,280
stuff and I take the inner product.
 

3403
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,790
stuff and I take the inner product.
Everyone with me? Just like literally

3404
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:50,800
Everyone with me? Just like literally
 

3405
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,390
Everyone with me? Just like literally
drawing out the idea design decisions

3406
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:52,400
drawing out the idea design decisions
 

3407
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,910
drawing out the idea design decisions
we've made in a graph.

3408
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:53,920
we've made in a graph.
 

3409
01:15:53,920 --> 01:16:00,870
we've made in a graph.
>> Yeah.

3410
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:00,880

 

3411
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,550

>> Ah, so I want a bunch of inner products.

3412
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:04,560
>> Ah, so I want a bunch of inner products.
 

3413
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,070
>> Ah, so I want a bunch of inner products.
>> So I'm just doing this over and over

3414
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:06,080
>> So I'm just doing this over and over
 

3415
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,910
>> So I'm just doing this over and over
again.

3416
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:07,920
again.
 

3417
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,470
again.
Okay. So these this these are my S's my

3418
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:10,480
Okay. So these this these are my S's my
 

3419
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:16,070
Okay. So these this these are my S's my
scores right my scores are coming here

3420
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080

 

3421
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,189

then I softmax them to get probabilities

3422
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:19,199
then I softmax them to get probabilities
 

3423
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,270
then I softmax them to get probabilities
I'll write the S for the scores from

3424
01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:21,280
I'll write the S for the scores from
 

3425
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:31,270
I'll write the S for the scores from
before

3426
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,280

 

3427
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,070

so now I want to run into an expectation

3428
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:34,080
so now I want to run into an expectation
 

3429
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,430
so now I want to run into an expectation
that takes probabilities on one side and

3430
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:35,440
that takes probabilities on one side and
 

3431
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,790
that takes probabilities on one side and
have takes some kind of values on the

3432
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:36,800
have takes some kind of values on the
 

3433
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,790
have takes some kind of values on the
other side

3434
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:38,800
other side
 

3435
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,510
other side
up there. This is my

3436
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
up there. This is my
 

3437
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,669
up there. This is my
learned function

3438
01:16:43,669 --> 01:16:43,679
learned function
 

3439
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,390
learned function
G

3440
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
G
 

3441
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,149
G
simplest learned function linear

3442
01:16:48,149 --> 01:16:48,159
simplest learned function linear
 

3443
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,630
simplest learned function linear
function.

3444
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:50,640
function.
 

3445
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,229
function.
So I put a learnable linear function

3446
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:52,239
So I put a learnable linear function
 

3447
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:53,750
So I put a learnable linear function
here. I should use the same color I was

3448
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
here. I should use the same color I was
 

3449
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:59,750
here. I should use the same color I was
using before

3450
01:16:59,750 --> 01:16:59,760

 

3451
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:05,669

for learnable things.

3452
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:05,679

 

3453
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,709

And now I get an expectation that

3454
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:08,719
And now I get an expectation that
 

3455
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:11,189
And now I get an expectation that
combines all these things. So now I've

3456
01:17:11,189 --> 01:17:11,199
combines all these things. So now I've
 

3457
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:12,950
combines all these things. So now I've
got

3458
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
got
 

3459
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,709
got
this part of my general thing. Now I

3460
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:16,719
this part of my general thing. Now I
 

3461
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,310
this part of my general thing. Now I
want a general function. So what's my

3462
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:18,320
want a general function. So what's my
 

3463
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,229
want a general function. So what's my
general function? I stick something

3464
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:20,239
general function? I stick something
 

3465
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:24,310
general function? I stick something
everything into an MLP

3466
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320

 

3467
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:36,149

with learnable weights.

3468
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:36,159

 

3469
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:39,910

So this reasoning comes from graph

3470
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:39,920
So this reasoning comes from graph
 

3471
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,750
So this reasoning comes from graph
neural net

3472
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:41,760
neural net
 

3473
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,669
neural net
just says I have to be permutation

3474
01:17:43,669 --> 01:17:43,679
just says I have to be permutation
 

3475
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,390
just says I have to be permutation
invariant on neighbors. I can treat

3476
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:46,400
invariant on neighbors. I can treat
 

3477
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,270
invariant on neighbors. I can treat
myself se specially

3478
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:49,280
myself se specially
 

3479
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,110
myself se specially
and I choose to wrap everything in a

3480
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:51,120
and I choose to wrap everything in a
 

3481
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,189
and I choose to wrap everything in a
residual block because I learned that

3482
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:53,199
residual block because I learned that
 

3483
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,270
residual block because I learned that
lesson in resnets

3484
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:55,280
lesson in resnets
 

3485
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,149
lesson in resnets
and I'll put a normalization up out in

3486
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
and I'll put a normalization up out in
 

3487
01:17:58,159 --> 01:17:59,750
and I'll put a normalization up out in
front somewhere because that's good

3488
01:17:59,750 --> 01:17:59,760
front somewhere because that's good
 

3489
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,950
front somewhere because that's good
practice when I'm using ResNet.

3490
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:02,960
practice when I'm using ResNet.
 

3491
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,790
practice when I'm using ResNet.
Okay,

3492
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:04,800
Okay,
 

3493
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,510
Okay,
so this is the kind of thing that one

3494
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:07,520
so this is the kind of thing that one
 

3495
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,430
so this is the kind of thing that one
can do from the perspective of a

3496
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:11,440
can do from the perspective of a
 

3497
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,030
can do from the perspective of a
constraint.

3498
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,040
constraint.
 

3499
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:16,470
constraint.
I don't I can't do a con, but I want to

3500
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:16,480
I don't I can't do a con, but I want to
 

3501
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,430
I don't I can't do a con, but I want to
do something that lets me

3502
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:19,440
do something that lets me
 

3503
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,709
do something that lets me
take advantage of information on a

3504
01:18:20,709 --> 01:18:20,719
take advantage of information on a
 

3505
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:23,030
take advantage of information on a
graph. And so the first place this kind

3506
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:23,040
graph. And so the first place this kind
 

3507
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,189
graph. And so the first place this kind
of stuff came up was in graph neural

3508
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:25,199
of stuff came up was in graph neural
 

3509
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:29,990
of stuff came up was in graph neural
nets because it's natural.

3510
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,000
nets because it's natural.
 

3511
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,110
nets because it's natural.
Okay. So, uh questions that people have

3512
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:33,120
Okay. So, uh questions that people have
 

3513
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,709
Okay. So, uh questions that people have
on what we're doing here. Yeah.

3514
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:34,719
on what we're doing here. Yeah.
 

3515
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:37,110
on what we're doing here. Yeah.
>> So, here we are updating like every node

3516
01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:37,120
>> So, here we are updating like every node
 

3517
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,550
>> So, here we are updating like every node
based on the data, right?

3518
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:38,560
based on the data, right?
 

3519
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,390
based on the data, right?
>> Yes. And after we update your

3520
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:40,400
>> Yes. And after we update your
 

3521
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,550
>> Yes. And after we update your
boundaries, how are we going to um

3522
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:42,560
boundaries, how are we going to um
 

3523
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,110
boundaries, how are we going to um
define your positions with respect to

3524
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:45,120
define your positions with respect to
 

3525
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,750
define your positions with respect to
their new layers neighbors like?

3526
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:47,760
their new layers neighbors like?
 

3527
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,350
their new layers neighbors like?
>> Excellent question. The question was,

3528
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:49,360
>> Excellent question. The question was,
 

3529
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,669
>> Excellent question. The question was,
let me repeat it for the u recording.

3530
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:51,679
let me repeat it for the u recording.
 

3531
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,310
let me repeat it for the u recording.
The question was if we do this, we start

3532
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:54,320
The question was if we do this, we start
 

3533
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,709
The question was if we do this, we start
with a graph. The graph has a topology

3534
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719
with a graph. The graph has a topology
 

3535
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,030
with a graph. The graph has a topology
of neighborhood. We then take

3536
01:18:59,030 --> 01:18:59,040
of neighborhood. We then take
 

3537
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,189
of neighborhood. We then take
information inside the graph and we get

3538
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:01,199
information inside the graph and we get
 

3539
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:02,870
information inside the graph and we get
new information inside the graph at

3540
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:02,880
new information inside the graph at
 

3541
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,709
new information inside the graph at
every position.

3542
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:04,719
every position.
 

3543
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:07,590
every position.
Okay. Now the question is what do we do

3544
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:07,600
Okay. Now the question is what do we do
 

3545
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,750
Okay. Now the question is what do we do
about the graph topology?

3546
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:09,760
about the graph topology?
 

3547
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,189
about the graph topology?
And the answer is like a CNN we're going

3548
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:13,199
And the answer is like a CNN we're going
 

3549
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,430
And the answer is like a CNN we're going
to say the graph topology does not

3550
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:15,440
to say the graph topology does not
 

3551
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:20,390
to say the graph topology does not
change ever. It's always the same graph.

3552
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:20,400
change ever. It's always the same graph.
 

3553
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,990
change ever. It's always the same graph.
That's the style of operation we're

3554
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:22,000
That's the style of operation we're
 

3555
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,910
That's the style of operation we're
doing now. Okay? We're never changing

3556
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:23,920
doing now. Okay? We're never changing
 

3557
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:28,310
doing now. Okay? We're never changing
the graph topology.

3558
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:28,320

 

3559
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,030

Question.

3560
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:29,040
Question.
 

3561
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,709
Question.
>> Why don't we normalize our neighbors

3562
01:19:30,709 --> 01:19:30,719
>> Why don't we normalize our neighbors
 

3563
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,149
>> Why don't we normalize our neighbors
when we pass?

3564
01:19:32,149 --> 01:19:32,159
when we pass?
 

3565
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:33,350
when we pass?
>> Ah great question. Why don't we

3566
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:33,360
>> Ah great question. Why don't we
 

3567
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,430
>> Ah great question. Why don't we
normalize neighbors? We can. That's also

3568
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:35,440
normalize neighbors? We can. That's also
 

3569
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,550
normalize neighbors? We can. That's also
a choice.

3570
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:38,560
a choice.
 

3571
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,590
a choice.
I mean, the reason we're potentially not

3572
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:41,600
I mean, the reason we're potentially not
 

3573
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,350
I mean, the reason we're potentially not
normalizing the neighbors, we might want

3574
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:43,360
normalizing the neighbors, we might want
 

3575
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,310
normalizing the neighbors, we might want
to normalize the neighbors here or here

3576
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:46,320
to normalize the neighbors here or here
 

3577
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,830
to normalize the neighbors here or here
somewhere,

3578
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:47,840
somewhere,
 

3579
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,470
somewhere,
right? Is the inner products are not are

3580
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:50,480
right? Is the inner products are not are
 

3581

right? Is the inner products are not are
friendly

3582
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:52,080
friendly
 

3583
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,830
friendly
potentially to what's happening with uh

3584
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:55,840
potentially to what's happening with uh
 

3585
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,470

3587
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,030
normalization. They don't care. Things
get bigger. That's okay. Potentially

3588
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:01,040
get bigger. That's okay. Potentially
 

3589
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,350
get bigger. That's okay. Potentially
softmax will scale everything back down.

3590
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,360
softmax will scale everything back down.
 

3591
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,030
softmax will scale everything back down.
It doesn't care if things are big. Cares

3592
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:05,040
It doesn't care if things are big. Cares
 

3593
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,669
It doesn't care if things are big. Cares
for other reasons, but not like very

3594
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
for other reasons, but not like very
 

3595
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,350
for other reasons, but not like very
much. Here we might want to normalize or

3596
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:11,360
much. Here we might want to normalize or
 

3597
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,990
much. Here we might want to normalize or
here. It doesn't matter where we do it

3598
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:14,000
here. It doesn't matter where we do it
 

3599
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,990
here. It doesn't matter where we do it
at some level. Um

3600
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:18,000
at some level. Um
 

3601
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,430
at some level. Um
because we do want to care we care if

3602
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:19,440
because we do want to care we care if
 

3603
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,950
because we do want to care we care if
the MLP gets gets hit in the right

3604
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:20,960
the MLP gets gets hit in the right
 

3605
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,149
the MLP gets gets hit in the right
place. So we might have to put a

3606
01:20:22,149 --> 01:20:22,159
place. So we might have to put a
 

3607
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:23,590
place. So we might have to put a
normalization somewhere in front of it.

3608
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:23,600
normalization somewhere in front of it.
 

3609
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,270
normalization somewhere in front of it.
But that's like standard thinking.

3610
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:25,280
But that's like standard thinking.
 

3611
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,270
But that's like standard thinking.
There's nothing particularly graph

3612
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:27,280
There's nothing particularly graph
 

3613
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,550

change something else. If it works
 

3655

3657
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,430
better, great. Is it still good enough?
No. Try adding more blocks. This is just

3658
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:15,440
No. Try adding more blocks. This is just
 

3659
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,830
No. Try adding more blocks. This is just
iterative refinement of neural

01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:17,840
iterative refinement of neural
 

3661
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,550
iterative refinement of neural
architecture. Um, same as a reset for a

3663
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,149

con. There's nothing different about a

3664
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:22,159
con. There's nothing different about a
 

3665
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,390
con. There's nothing different about a
graph neural net and a connet in that

3666
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:24,400
graph neural net and a connet in that
 

3667
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:27,110
graph neural net and a connet in that
setup.

Practice. What inner product would we

Practice. What inner product would we
 

3675
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,550
Practice. What inner product would we
use specifically?

3676
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:32,560

3677
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,310

>> Oh yeah. When I if I say inner product

3694
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:50,560

 

3695
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,870

>> That's so we're undirected edges. So all

3696

3697
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,350
>> That's so we're undirected edges. So all
I know is that these are my neighbors.

3698
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:55,360
I know is that these are my neighbors.
 

3699
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,870
I know is that these are my neighbors.
I don't know where they are relative to

3700
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:56,880
I don't know where they are relative to
 

3701
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,790
I don't know where they are relative to
me. They're just my neighbors. That's

3702
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:58,800
me. They're just my neighbors. That's
 

3703
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,310
me. They're just my neighbors. That's
the whole problem.

3704
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:00,320
the whole problem.
 

3705
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,110
the whole problem.
So the fact that we don't know where

3706
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:03,120
So the fact that we don't know where
 

3707
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,390
So the fact that we don't know where
they are relative to me, the

3708
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:04,400
they are relative to me, the
 

3709
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,790
they are relative to me, the
undirectedness of the graph forces me to

3710
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:06,800
undirectedness of the graph forces me to
 

3711
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,110
undirectedness of the graph forces me to
be creative and to try to avoid this

3712
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:09,120
be creative and to try to avoid this
 

3713
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,310
be creative and to try to avoid this
over smoothing problem. So to avoid the

3714
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:12,320
over smoothing problem. So to avoid the
 

3715
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,750
over smoothing problem. So to avoid the
over smoothing problem, I need

3716
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:13,760
over smoothing problem, I need
 

3717
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,510
over smoothing problem, I need
nonlinearity

3718
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:15,520
nonlinearity
 

3719
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,510
nonlinearity
fundamentally because the whole problem

3720
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:17,520
fundamentally because the whole problem
 

3721
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,990
fundamentally because the whole problem
was the linearity of matrix

3722
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:20,000
was the linearity of matrix
 

3723
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,669
was the linearity of matrix
multiplication made just things become

3724
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
multiplication made just things become
 

3725
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,750
multiplication made just things become
averaging. So here I have to track

3726
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:23,760
averaging. So here I have to track
 

3727
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,629
averaging. So here I have to track
where's my nonlinearity.

3728
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639
where's my nonlinearity.
 

3729
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:30,390
where's my nonlinearity.
Okay, so what's nonlinear here?

3730
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:30,400
Okay, so what's nonlinear here?
 

3731
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,870
Okay, so what's nonlinear here?
Uh because I'm almost out of time, I'll

3732
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:32,880
Uh because I'm almost out of time, I'll
 

3733
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,590
Uh because I'm almost out of time, I'll
just mark the nonlinear things for you.

3734
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:35,600
just mark the nonlinear things for you.
 

3735
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,070
just mark the nonlinear things for you.
Um

3736
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:38,080
Um
 

3737
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,709
Um
so here so there's nonlinearity inside

3738
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:40,719
so here so there's nonlinearity inside
 

3739
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:46,070
so here so there's nonlinearity inside
here

3740
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:46,080

 

3741
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,709

inside the MLP, but that's after the

3742
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:48,719
inside the MLP, but that's after the
 

3743
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:50,149
inside the MLP, but that's after the
combin combination of neighbor

3744
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:50,159
combin combination of neighbor
 

3745
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:51,910
combin combination of neighbor
information has already happened. So

3746
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:51,920
information has already happened. So
 

3747
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,030
information has already happened. So
that can't help me too much. Okay, with

3748
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:55,040
that can't help me too much. Okay, with
 

3749
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,470
that can't help me too much. Okay, with
this over smoothing problem by itself,

3750
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:58,480
this over smoothing problem by itself,
 

3751
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,990
this over smoothing problem by itself,
there's a nonlinearity inside the

3752
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:00,000
there's a nonlinearity inside the
 

3753
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,390
there's a nonlinearity inside the
softmax.

3754
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:04,400

 

3755
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,390

There's no nonlinearity here. There's

3756
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:06,400
There's no nonlinearity here. There's
 

3757
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,669
There's no nonlinearity here. There's
kind of a mild one of this

3758
01:23:07,669 --> 01:23:07,679
kind of a mild one of this
 

3759
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:18,550
kind of a mild one of this
multiplication. So, it's mild nonlinear.

3760
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:18,560

 

3761
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,310

There's mild nonlinearity,

3762
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
There's mild nonlinearity,
 

3763
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:28,070
There's mild nonlinearity,
multiplication in the inner product.

3764
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:28,080

 

3765
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,229

And there's a normalization mildly

3766
01:23:30,229 --> 01:23:30,239
And there's a normalization mildly
 

3767
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:37,669
And there's a normalization mildly
nonlinear.

3768
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679

 

3769
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,270

So the important thing is there's

3770
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:39,280
So the important thing is there's
 

3771
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,430
So the important thing is there's
nonlinearity that's coming in this

3772
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:41,440
nonlinearity that's coming in this
 

3773
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,110
nonlinearity that's coming in this
process

3774
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:43,120
process
 

3775
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,270
process
which is I needed that to avoid the

3776
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:45,280
which is I needed that to avoid the
 

3777
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,470
which is I needed that to avoid the
problem. Yeah.

3778
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:46,480
problem. Yeah.
 

3779
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,910
problem. Yeah.

If this works, great. If not, I have to

3815
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:38,149
not much I can do because there's not
much I can do I have to be creative this

3816
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:38,159
much I can do I have to be creative this
 

3817
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,950
much I can do I have to be creative this
is a natural first thing this is called

3818
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:40,960
is a natural first thing this is called
 

3819
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,149
is a natural first thing this is called
this part here is called attention

3820
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:44,159
this part here is called attention
 

3821
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:47,110
this part here is called attention
mechanisms

3822
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:47,120

 

3823
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:52,390

Okay, this thing from here through here.

3824
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:52,400
Okay, this thing from here through here.
 

3825
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,950
Okay, this thing from here through here.
Okay, and they are very important in

3826
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:54,960
Okay, and they are very important in
 

3827
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,709
Okay, and they are very important in
transformers.

3828
01:24:56,709 --> 01:24:56,719
transformers.
 

3829
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,910
transformers.
Here the motivation isn't a particular

3830
01:24:59,910 --> 01:24:59,920
Here the motivation isn't a particular
 

3831
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,430
Here the motivation isn't a particular
desired functionality. It was oh my

3832
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:03,440
desired functionality. It was oh my
 

3833
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:06,310
desired functionality. It was oh my
goodness, I can't do anything,

3834
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:06,320
goodness, I can't do anything,
 

3835
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:10,229
goodness, I can't do anything,
right? What can I do? Right? It's just

3836
01:25:10,229 --> 01:25:10,239
right? What can I do? Right? It's just
 

3837
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:11,669
right? What can I do? Right? It's just
it's a different way of looking at

3838
01:25:11,669 --> 01:25:11,679
it's a different way of looking at
 

3839
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:14,709
it's a different way of looking at
attention coming from a different story.

3840
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:14,719
attention coming from a different story.
 

3841
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,669
attention coming from a different story.
When I we talk about attention um in the

3842
01:25:17,669 --> 01:25:17,679
When I we talk about attention um in the
 

3843
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,430
When I we talk about attention um in the
transformer case, we'll talk about it

3844
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:19,440
transformer case, we'll talk about it
 

3845
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,950
transformer case, we'll talk about it
from a different angle of how you can

3846
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:20,960
from a different angle of how you can
 

3847
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,510
from a different angle of how you can
motivate it differently. But it's

3848
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:23,520
motivate it differently. But it's
 

3849
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,950
motivate it differently. But it's
important to understand that it also

3850
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:24,960
important to understand that it also
 

3851
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,070
important to understand that it also
comes out here. And so you'll see in the

3852
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,080
comes out here. And so you'll see in the
 

3853
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,189
comes out here. And so you'll see in the
literature many people will say a

3854
01:25:31,189 --> 01:25:31,199
literature many people will say a
 

3855
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:34,149
literature many people will say a
transformer is just a graph neural net

3856
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:34,159
transformer is just a graph neural net
 

3857
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:37,910
transformer is just a graph neural net
except the graph is a complete graph.

3858
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:37,920
except the graph is a complete graph.
 

3859
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,830
except the graph is a complete graph.
That's all the undirected graph complete

3860
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:39,840
That's all the undirected graph complete
 

3861
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:43,430
That's all the undirected graph complete
graph gives rise to a transformer

3862
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:43,440
graph gives rise to a transformer
 

3863
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,030
graph gives rise to a transformer
from this picture. Okay. So that's a

3864
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:47,040
from this picture. Okay. So that's a
 

3865
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,229
from this picture. Okay. So that's a
historical uh kind of perspective.

3866
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:50,239
historical uh kind of perspective.
 

3867
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,470
historical uh kind of perspective.
But um next time I don't know I'll

3868
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:52,480
But um next time I don't know I'll
 

3869
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,110
But um next time I don't know I'll
decide the it turns out we can actually

3870
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:55,120
decide the it turns out we can actually
 

3871
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:59,510
decide the it turns out we can actually
solve this problem too. Okay. But maybe

3872
01:25:59,510 --> 01:25:59,520
solve this problem too. Okay. But maybe
 

3873
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,430
solve this problem too. Okay. But maybe
I'll I'll do a little bit of that next

3874
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:01,440
I'll I'll do a little bit of that next
 

3875
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,910
I'll I'll do a little bit of that next
time. Um but that's cool for other

3876
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:03,920
time. Um but that's cool for other
 

3877
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:09,040
time. Um but that's cool for other
reasons. Okay. Office hours now.
