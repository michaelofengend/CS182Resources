cleared the weight list. This means that
 

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,990

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
So with that I'm actually not going to
 

347
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,870
So with that I'm actually not going to
start on this. I'm going to start here.

start on this. I'm going to start here.
So last time we talked about you know

350
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
So last time we talked about you know
 

351
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,949
So last time we talked about you know

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm going to first go through this proof
 

363
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,230
I'm going to first go through this proof
that I only kind of started last time

364
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
that I only kind of started last time
 

365
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,870
that I only kind of started last time
and didn't complete. And then what we're

366
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
and didn't complete. And then what we're
 

367
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,230
and didn't complete. And then what we're
going to do is we're going to build to

368
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
going to do is we're going to build to
 

369
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,910
going to do is we're going to build to

we talked about stoastic gradient

396
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
we talked about stoastic gradient
 

397
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,910
we talked about stoastic gradient
descent and we said look there's many

help you escape things like local minima
 

409
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,030
help you escape things like local minima
or saddle points but what's the downside

or saddle points but what's the downside
 

411
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,590
or saddle points but what's the downside
of sarcastic gradient descent well it's

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,110
you're close to the optimum it can kind
of bounce around or to get a proof of

429
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,710
convergence for stoastic gradient
descent what you need to do is you need

430
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
descent what you need to do is you need
 

431
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,069
descent what you need to do is you need
to have a decaying step size or decaying

432
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
to have a decaying step size or decaying
 

433
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,030
to have a decaying step size or decaying
learning rate built into it.

434
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
learning rate built into it.
 

435
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,110
learning rate built into it.
But it turns out that in some nice

436
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
But it turns out that in some nice
 

437
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,509
But it turns out that in some nice
special cases we can actually get a

438
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
special cases we can actually get a
 

439
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,150
special cases we can actually get a
proof that says that stoastic gradient

440
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
proof that says that stoastic gradient
 

441
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,949
proof that says that stoastic gradient
descent can converge to an

442
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
descent can converge to an
 

443
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,389
descent can converge to an
it can converge I guess um in the case

444
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
it can converge I guess um in the case
 

445
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,470
it can converge I guess um in the case
where you have a set of systems where

446
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
where you have a set of systems where
 

447
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,509
where you have a set of systems where
the loss can actually go to zero and

448
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
the loss can actually go to zero and
 

449
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,829
the loss can actually go to zero and
you're using only constant step side.

450
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:51,839
you're using only constant step side.
 

451
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,590
you're using only constant step side.
Okay so you're not having a step size

452
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
Okay so you're not having a step size
 

453
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,030
Okay so you're not having a step size
that is decaying as time goes on. And so

454
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
that is decaying as time goes on. And so
 

455
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,069
that is decaying as time goes on. And so
we set this up last time. So I have a

456
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
we set this up last time. So I have a
 

457
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,269
we set this up last time. So I have a
underdetermined system of equations XW

458
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
underdetermined system of equations XW
 

459
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,350
underdetermined system of equations XW
equal to Y. And I'm thinking of a wide

460
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
equal to Y. And I'm thinking of a wide
 

461
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,550
equal to Y. And I'm thinking of a wide
um X, right? So I'm assuming that I have

462
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
um X, right? So I'm assuming that I have
 

463
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,030
um X, right? So I'm assuming that I have
full row rank, no degeneracy here, but

464
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
full row rank, no degeneracy here, but
 

465
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,430
full row rank, no degeneracy here, but
it is an underdetermined system. What

466
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
it is an underdetermined system. What
 

467
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,790
it is an underdetermined system. What
does this mean? I have an infinite

468
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
does this mean? I have an infinite
 

469
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,630
does this mean? I have an infinite
number of solutions. I can pick one

470
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
number of solutions. I can pick one
 

471
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,990
number of solutions. I can pick one
solution. And the solution that we

472
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
solution. And the solution that we
 

473
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,389
solution. And the solution that we
typically like to pick is the minimum

474
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
typically like to pick is the minimum
 

475
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,910
typically like to pick is the minimum
norm solution, right?

476
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
norm solution, right?
 

477
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,030
norm solution, right?
We know the uh formula for this. You've

478
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
We know the uh formula for this. You've
 

479
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,750
We know the uh formula for this. You've
done it all before in 127 or whatever

480
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
done it all before in 127 or whatever
 

481
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,590
done it all before in 127 or whatever
classes. And we can write war star is

482
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
classes. And we can write war star is
 

483
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,310
classes. And we can write war star is
exactly equal to this expression xrpose

484
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
exactly equal to this expression xrpose
 

485
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,910
exactly equal to this expression xrpose
xxxrpose inverse time y. And now let's

486
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
xxxrpose inverse time y. And now let's
 

487
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,750
xxxrpose inverse time y. And now let's
say we iterate on this with stoastic

488
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
say we iterate on this with stoastic
 

489
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,230
say we iterate on this with stoastic
gradient descent using the batch size of

490
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
gradient descent using the batch size of
 

491
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,829
gradient descent using the batch size of
one.

492
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
one.
 

493
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,670
one.
And I keep my initialization at zero.

494
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
And I keep my initialization at zero.
 

495
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,790
And I keep my initialization at zero.
Okay.

496
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800

 

497
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,470

So now what I want to do is I want to

498
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
So now what I want to do is I want to
 

499
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,590
So now what I want to do is I want to
think about this and I want to think

500
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
think about this and I want to think
 

501
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,350
think about this and I want to think
about in this particular case I actually

502
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
about in this particular case I actually
 

503
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,590
about in this particular case I actually
know where the optimum is. So instead of

504
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
know where the optimum is. So instead of
 

505
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,430
know where the optimum is. So instead of
thinking about SGD as just taking a path

506
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:05,440
thinking about SGD as just taking a path
 

507
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,069
thinking about SGD as just taking a path
in the weight space in the W space I

508
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
in the weight space in the W space I
 

509
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,629
in the weight space in the W space I
want to think about the error space. The

510
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
want to think about the error space. The
 

511
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,870
want to think about the error space. The
error space is basically what is my

512
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
error space is basically what is my
 

513
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,110
error space is basically what is my
distance from the optimum.

514
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
distance from the optimum.
 

515
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,590
distance from the optimum.
So I can just take my equation XW equal

516
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
So I can just take my equation XW equal
 

517
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,710
So I can just take my equation XW equal
to Y and reparameterize it to instead

518
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,720
to Y and reparameterize it to instead
 

519
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,230
to Y and reparameterize it to instead
write it in these new coordinates which

520
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
write it in these new coordinates which
 

521
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,710
write it in these new coordinates which
I call the Q coordinate system. Does

522
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
I call the Q coordinate system. Does
 

523
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,710
I call the Q coordinate system. Does
that make sense to everyone? So I'm

524
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
that make sense to everyone? So I'm
 

525
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,150
that make sense to everyone? So I'm
thinking of X Q equal to now zero

526
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
thinking of X Q equal to now zero
 

527
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,190
thinking of X Q equal to now zero
because X * W is Y and X * W star is

528
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
because X * W is Y and X * W star is
 

529
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,389
because X * W is Y and X * W star is
also Y. So I'm instead I'm just tracking

530
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
also Y. So I'm instead I'm just tracking
 

531
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,550
also Y. So I'm instead I'm just tracking
how far am I from this minor norm

532
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
how far am I from this minor norm
 

533
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,949
how far am I from this minor norm
solution that I'm hoping to get to. So

534
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
solution that I'm hoping to get to. So
 

535
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,269
solution that I'm hoping to get to. So
this is completely equivalent. But of

536
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
this is completely equivalent. But of
 

537
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,870
this is completely equivalent. But of
course I have to also adjust my initial

538
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
course I have to also adjust my initial
 

539
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,389
course I have to also adjust my initial
condition now because I've adjusted my

540
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
condition now because I've adjusted my
 

541
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,629
condition now because I've adjusted my
coordinates right. So I can't start with

542
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:50,639
coordinates right. So I can't start with
 

543
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,629
coordinates right. So I can't start with
uh this condition condition. So now w

544
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
uh this condition condition. So now w
 

545
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,269
uh this condition condition. So now w
knot instead becomes minus war because

546
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
knot instead becomes minus war because
 

547
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,030
knot instead becomes minus war because
when I start out at zero I'm negative

548
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
when I start out at zero I'm negative
 

549
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,829
when I start out at zero I'm negative
warst away from actual war star. Make

550
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
warst away from actual war star. Make
 

551
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,750
warst away from actual war star. Make
sense?

552
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
sense?
 

553
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,430
sense?
Good.

554
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
Good.
 

555
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,190
Good.
So if you've learned one thing from last

556
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
So if you've learned one thing from last
 

557
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,590
So if you've learned one thing from last
week's lecture, you've learned that the

558
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:09,600
week's lecture, you've learned that the
 

559
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,829
week's lecture, you've learned that the
SVD matters, right? Directions matter.

560
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
SVD matters, right? Directions matter.
 

561
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,670
SVD matters, right? Directions matter.
Singular val values matter because they

562
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:13,680
Singular val values matter because they
 

563
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,990
Singular val values matter because they
actually affect sometimes in good ways,

564
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
actually affect sometimes in good ways,
 

565
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,629
actually affect sometimes in good ways,
sometimes in bad ways, sometimes in we

566
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
sometimes in bad ways, sometimes in we
 

567
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,470
sometimes in bad ways, sometimes in we
don't really know ways how our um

568
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
don't really know ways how our um
 

569
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,870
don't really know ways how our um
function is going to uh behave under

570
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
function is going to uh behave under
 

571
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,190
function is going to uh behave under
gradient descent.

572
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
gradient descent.
 

573
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,629
gradient descent.
So if we really think about this

574
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
So if we really think about this
 

575
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,790
So if we really think about this
problem, we want to think about it in

576
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:30,800
problem, we want to think about it in
 

577
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,910
problem, we want to think about it in
essentially the SVD coordinates. So for

578
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
essentially the SVD coordinates. So for
 

579
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,230
essentially the SVD coordinates. So for
that I say let's take this xq

580
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,240
that I say let's take this xq
 

581
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,829
that I say let's take this xq
and I'm going to write it I'm going to

582
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
and I'm going to write it I'm going to
 

583
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,990
and I'm going to write it I'm going to
write the singular value decomposition u

584
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
write the singular value decomposition u
 

585
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,110
write the singular value decomposition u
sigma vranspose. Okay. So I'm going to

586
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
sigma vranspose. Okay. So I'm going to
 

587
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,949
sigma vranspose. Okay. So I'm going to
try I have a lot of equations written

588
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
try I have a lot of equations written
 

589
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,949
try I have a lot of equations written
out here but I'm going to try to make

590
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
out here but I'm going to try to make
 

591
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,590
out here but I'm going to try to make
sure I lecture at a speed such that you

592
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
sure I lecture at a speed such that you
 

593
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,790
sure I lecture at a speed such that you
can actually also write these down.

594
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
can actually also write these down.
 

595
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,710
can actually also write these down.
Okay. Um, so I'm going to try to trace

596
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
Okay. Um, so I'm going to try to trace
 

597
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,710
Okay. Um, so I'm going to try to trace
out things, take pauses because it will

598
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
out things, take pauses because it will
 

599
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,710
out things, take pauses because it will
all seem like, oh, of course it's making

600
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
all seem like, oh, of course it's making
 

601
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,710
all seem like, oh, of course it's making
sense, but that is called the magic of

602
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
sense, but that is called the magic of
 

603
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,389
sense, but that is called the magic of
lecture. Okay? And then there is the

604
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
lecture. Okay? And then there is the
 

605
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,629
lecture. Okay? And then there is the
despair of homework where you open it,

606
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
despair of homework where you open it,
 

607
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,550
despair of homework where you open it,
you're like, this actually doesn't make

608
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
you're like, this actually doesn't make
 

609
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,430
you're like, this actually doesn't make
any sense. So taking notes is a way to

610
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
any sense. So taking notes is a way to
 

611
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,750
any sense. So taking notes is a way to
bridge this gap. It will go better into

612
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
bridge this gap. It will go better into
 

613
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,189
bridge this gap. It will go better into
your brain if you write it down

614
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
your brain if you write it down
 

615
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,629
your brain if you write it down
yourself. And looking at your own

616
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
yourself. And looking at your own
 

617
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,629
yourself. And looking at your own
handwritten notes will help you learn

618
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
handwritten notes will help you learn
 

619
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,710
handwritten notes will help you learn
better. Okay?

620
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720

 

621
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,710

So I'm going to write out this SVD here.

622
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
So I'm going to write out this SVD here.
 

623
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,870
So I'm going to write out this SVD here.
We know now that X is a wide matrix,

624
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
We know now that X is a wide matrix,
 

625
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,430
We know now that X is a wide matrix,
right? So what does that mean? When the

626
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
right? So what does that mean? When the
 

627
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,829
right? So what does that mean? When the
SVD, the SVD is also going to be uh or

628
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
SVD, the SVD is also going to be uh or
 

629
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,509
SVD, the SVD is also going to be uh or
the sigma matrix is also going to be a

630
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519
the sigma matrix is also going to be a
 

631
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,550
the sigma matrix is also going to be a
wide matrix. And basically my zeros are

632
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560
wide matrix. And basically my zeros are
 

633
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,189
wide matrix. And basically my zeros are
going to be on this right side. And this

634
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:45,199
going to be on this right side. And this
 

635
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,110
going to be on this right side. And this
part, this n byn part here is going to

636
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
part, this n byn part here is going to
 

637
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,509
part, this n byn part here is going to
be the diagonal part, right? I split it

638
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
be the diagonal part, right? I split it
 

639
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,750
be the diagonal part, right? I split it
up. Basically, I'm trying to get rid of

640
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
up. Basically, I'm trying to get rid of
 

641
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,110
up. Basically, I'm trying to get rid of
the zeros, the stuff that doesn't

642
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
the zeros, the stuff that doesn't
 

643
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,949
the zeros, the stuff that doesn't
actually matter in terms of the steps

644
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
actually matter in terms of the steps
 

645
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,629
actually matter in terms of the steps
that I'm going to take.

646
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639

 

647
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,550

And now, this actually helps me out a

648
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:00,560
And now, this actually helps me out a
 

649
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,069
And now, this actually helps me out a
bit because I want to think about things

650
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
bit because I want to think about things
 

651
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,230
bit because I want to think about things
in the SVD basis. So, I pull this

652
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
in the SVD basis. So, I pull this
 

653
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,710
in the SVD basis. So, I pull this
vranspose out

654
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
vranspose out
 

655
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,750
vranspose out
over here

656
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
over here
 

657
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,550
over here
and I'm going to call this vranspose Q

658
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
and I'm going to call this vranspose Q
 

659
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,750
and I'm going to call this vranspose Q
Z. I'm basically rewriting things in the

660
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
Z. I'm basically rewriting things in the
 

661
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,829
Z. I'm basically rewriting things in the
SVD basis, right? So I'm just doing a

662
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
SVD basis, right? So I'm just doing a
 

663
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,350
SVD basis, right? So I'm just doing a
change of basis. And so now vranspose q

664
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
change of basis. And so now vranspose q
 

665
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,990
change of basis. And so now vranspose q
I'm going to set to be equal to z. And

666
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm going to set to be equal to z. And
 

667
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,430
I'm going to set to be equal to z. And
I'm going to call u * sigma 1 sigma 1

668
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
I'm going to call u * sigma 1 sigma 1
 

669
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,389
I'm going to call u * sigma 1 sigma 1
this matrix

670
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
this matrix
 

671
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,030
this matrix
x twiddle.

672
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
x twiddle.
 

673
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,269
x twiddle.
Okay. So xq I can write as x twiddle 0

674
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
Okay. So xq I can write as x twiddle 0
 

675
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,509
Okay. So xq I can write as x twiddle 0
time z.

676
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519

 

677
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,069

What is this doing? This is basically

678
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
What is this doing? This is basically
 

679
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,030
What is this doing? This is basically
telling me what parts of this vector Z

680
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
telling me what parts of this vector Z
 

681
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,310
telling me what parts of this vector Z
are going to matter and which parts are

682
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:52,320
are going to matter and which parts are
 

683
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,590
are going to matter and which parts are
not because this is basically going to

684
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
not because this is basically going to
 

685
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,550
not because this is basically going to
get by get hit by zeros.

686
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
get by get hit by zeros.
 

687
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,949
get by get hit by zeros.
And similarly, I can look at my initial

688
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
And similarly, I can look at my initial
 

689
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,509
And similarly, I can look at my initial
condition and I'm not going to do this

690
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
condition and I'm not going to do this
 

691
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,310
condition and I'm not going to do this
algebra out here. You can do it out um

692
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,320
algebra out here. You can do it out um
 

693
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,189
algebra out here. You can do it out um
on the homework on your own time. But I

694
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
on the homework on your own time. But I
 

695
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,150
on the homework on your own time. But I
take my initial condition Z.

696
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
take my initial condition Z.
 

697
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,550
take my initial condition Z.
Again, I change of basis. I do the

698
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
Again, I change of basis. I do the
 

699
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,389
Again, I change of basis. I do the
change of basis to put it into the SVD

700
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
change of basis to put it into the SVD
 

701
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,990
change of basis to put it into the SVD
basis.

702
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
basis.
 

703
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,629
basis.
And basically by plugging in the formula

704
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
And basically by plugging in the formula
 

705
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,870
And basically by plugging in the formula
for warstar and plugging in the SVD of

706
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
for warstar and plugging in the SVD of
 

707
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,389
for warstar and plugging in the SVD of
X, I can show that this new initial

708
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
X, I can show that this new initial
 

709
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,509
X, I can show that this new initial
condition will also have zero entries at

710
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
condition will also have zero entries at
 

711
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,430
condition will also have zero entries at
the bottom. In fact, the last D minus N

712
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
the bottom. In fact, the last D minus N
 

713
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,749
the bottom. In fact, the last D minus N
entries are going to be zero. Okay? And

714
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
entries are going to be zero. Okay? And
 

715
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,350
entries are going to be zero. Okay? And
it's coming basically from the fact that

716
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
it's coming basically from the fact that
 

717
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,030
it's coming basically from the fact that
the SVD has this zero here. Okay?

718
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
the SVD has this zero here. Okay?
 

719
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,310
the SVD has this zero here. Okay?
Everyone with me?

720
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320

because when I look at this sigma here,

724
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
because when I look at this sigma here,
 

725
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,230
because when I look at this sigma here,
this is a um it has n rows and d columns

this is a um it has n rows and d columns
 

727
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,629
this is a um it has n rows and d columns
and this sigma 1 here is n byn. So the

728
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
and this sigma 1 here is n byn. So the
 

729
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,470
and this sigma 1 here is n byn. So the
remaining must be d minus n. Yeah.

So, I started here. Then I did one

752
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
So, I started here. Then I did one
 

753
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,270
So, I started here. Then I did one
coordinate transformation to move it

coordinate transformation to move it
 

755
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,510
coordinate transformation to move it
into the Q coordinates. Then I did a

756
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
into the Q coordinates. Then I did a
 

757
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,270
into the Q coordinates. Then I did a
another transformation to move it into

Does that make sense?

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,760
Does that make sense?
 

763
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,430
Does that make sense?
Other questions?

764
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440

 

765
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,909

Did I see a hand or no?

766
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
Did I see a hand or no?
 

767
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,909
Did I see a hand or no?
Okay.

768
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919

 

769
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,669

So, what matters is now this new

770
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
So, what matters is now this new
 

771
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,270
So, what matters is now this new
equation

772
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280

775
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,310

779
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,710
matters from this equation is this times
this. The rest is zero. And the initial

780
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
this. The rest is zero. And the initial
 

781
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,789
this. The rest is zero. And the initial

those last D minus N spots either
 

785
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,630
those last D minus N spots either
because the initial condition itself is

786
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
because the initial condition itself is
 

787
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,230
because the initial condition itself is
zero over there. Okay, so I really don't

788
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
zero over there. Okay, so I really don't
 

789
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,750
zero over there. Okay, so I really don't
have to worry about those last D minus N

790
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
have to worry about those last D minus N
 

791
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,669
have to worry about those last D minus N
coordinates. I might as well, you know,

792
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
coordinates. I might as well, you know,
 

793
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,350
coordinates. I might as well, you know,
put them on the bench and focus on the

794
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
put them on the bench and focus on the
 

795
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,310
put them on the bench and focus on the
stuff that matters. So I have XZ equal

796
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
stuff that matters. So I have XZ equal
 

797
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,430
stuff that matters. So I have XZ equal
to zero here. And the row of this is

798
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
to zero here. And the row of this is
 

799
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,310
to zero here. And the row of this is
basically the same as the row of our

800
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
basically the same as the row of our
 

801
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,789
basically the same as the row of our
original equation.

802
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
original equation.
 

803
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,669
original equation.
You can justify this rigorously. That's

804
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
You can justify this rigorously. That's
 

805
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,029
You can justify this rigorously. That's
part of your homework here. I'm just

806
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
part of your homework here. I'm just
 

807
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,750
part of your homework here. I'm just
going to assert it.

808
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:39,760
going to assert it.
 

809
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,270
going to assert it.
The essential thing is that all you've

810
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,280
The essential thing is that all you've
 

811
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,310
The essential thing is that all you've
done is you've dropped the zeros.

812
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
done is you've dropped the zeros.
 

813
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,230
done is you've dropped the zeros.
So now what do we want to do? We want to

814
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
So now what do we want to do? We want to
 

815
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,470
So now what do we want to do? We want to
say okay this is just our system of

816
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
say okay this is just our system of
 

817
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,430
say okay this is just our system of
equations, right? We haven't even

818
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
equations, right? We haven't even
 

819
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,510
equations, right? We haven't even
touched gradient descent or SGD yet. We

820
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:51,520
touched gradient descent or SGD yet. We
 

821
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,510
touched gradient descent or SGD yet. We
want to say what happens when we run SGD

822
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
want to say what happens when we run SGD
 

823
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,830
want to say what happens when we run SGD
on this problem. So what is our gradient

824
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
on this problem. So what is our gradient
 

825
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,909
on this problem. So what is our gradient
descent update? Well, our gradient

826
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
descent update? Well, our gradient
 

827
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,029
descent update? Well, our gradient
descent update would be ZT + 1 is equal

828
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
descent update would be ZT + 1 is equal
 

829
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,470
descent update would be ZT + 1 is equal
to ZT minus 2 A XRPOSE X time ZT. This

830
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480
to ZT minus 2 A XRPOSE X time ZT. This
 

831
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,110
to ZT minus 2 A XRPOSE X time ZT. This
needs an arrow here.

832
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
needs an arrow here.
 

833
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,630
needs an arrow here.
And the loss function that we care

834
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
And the loss function that we care
 

835
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,150
And the loss function that we care
about,

836
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
about,
 

837
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,909
about,
we're thinking about this squared loss.

838
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
we're thinking about this squared loss.
 

839
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,390
we're thinking about this squared loss.
So the gradient of my loss I can just

840
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
So the gradient of my loss I can just
 

841
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,070
So the gradient of my loss I can just
write as this, right?

842
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080

 

843
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,590

Okay.

844
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,600
Okay.
 

845
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,669
Okay.
So now I want to think about with this

846
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
So now I want to think about with this
 

847
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,350
So now I want to think about with this
loss what happens when I take a SGD

848
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
loss what happens when I take a SGD
 

849
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,470
loss what happens when I take a SGD
step. Okay? And I want you to think

850
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
step. Okay? And I want you to think
 

851
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,310
step. Okay? And I want you to think
about that and write it out yourself

852
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,320
about that and write it out yourself
 

853
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,390
about that and write it out yourself
because this is just you know just to

854
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
because this is just you know just to
 

855
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,830
because this is just you know just to
reme make sure that everyone's with me

856
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
reme make sure that everyone's with me
 

857
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,470
reme make sure that everyone's with me
on what SGD is.

858
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
on what SGD is.
 

859
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,190
on what SGD is.
So take this you know let me hide this

860
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,200
So take this you know let me hide this
 

861
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,830
So take this you know let me hide this
for one second

862
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
for one second
 

863
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,870
for one second
and given this loss function what is the

864
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
and given this loss function what is the
 

865
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,950
and given this loss function what is the
SGD update equation that you need for

866
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
SGD update equation that you need for
 

867
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,870
SGD update equation that you need for
this particular problem.

868
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:58,880

 

869
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:08,870

Let me put a timer on.

870
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880

 

871
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,029

I highly recommend talking to the person

872
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
I highly recommend talking to the person
 

873
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,870
I highly recommend talking to the person
next to you. It's a good exercise. You

874
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
next to you. It's a good exercise. You
 

875
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,230
next to you. It's a good exercise. You
will get to know someone and you might

876
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
will get to know someone and you might
 

877
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,950
will get to know someone and you might
get a new idea or you might help someone

878
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
get a new idea or you might help someone
 

879
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,789
get a new idea or you might help someone
figure out the answer. So find a person

880
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
figure out the answer. So find a person
 

881
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:42,630
figure out the answer. So find a person
and talk to them. It's a requirement.

882
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640

 

883
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:50,470

Don't

884
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480

 

885
00:20:50,480 --> 00:21:03,669

believe

886
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679

 

887
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,830

what you do.

888
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840

 

889
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,990

[Music]

890
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000

 

891
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,669

That's my timer, but I'm giving you one

892
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
That's my timer, but I'm giving you one
 

893
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:44,310
That's my timer, but I'm giving you one
more minute.

894
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,320

 

895
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,430

I'm just here.

896
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440

 

897
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,510

>> And now she's just

898
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,520

 

899
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:09,029

explain

900
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039

 

901
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,190

Okay, so

902
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200

 

903
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,470

>> what's the deal? What's happening with

904
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
>> what's the deal? What's happening with
 

905
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,149
>> what's the deal? What's happening with
SGD, right? We have this gradient

906
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
SGD, right? We have this gradient
 

907
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,390
SGD, right? We have this gradient
descent update, but with SGD, we're

908
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400
descent update, but with SGD, we're
 

909
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,909
descent update, but with SGD, we're
saying look, I don't want to take the

910
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
saying look, I don't want to take the
 

911
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,430
saying look, I don't want to take the
gradient over all of the data points.

912
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
gradient over all of the data points.
 

913
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,750
gradient over all of the data points.
I'm going to just pick one data point at

914
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
I'm going to just pick one data point at
 

915
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,510
I'm going to just pick one data point at
a time, right? And since I'm choosing

916
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
a time, right? And since I'm choosing
 

917
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,750
a time, right? And since I'm choosing
batch size one, so what we're going to

918
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:27,760
batch size one, so what we're going to
 

919
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,230
batch size one, so what we're going to
do is we're going to say let's represent

920
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
do is we're going to say let's represent
 

921
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,310
do is we're going to say let's represent
the particular

922
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,320
the particular
 

923
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,029
the particular
data point that you're choosing by this

924
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
data point that you're choosing by this
 

925
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,390
data point that you're choosing by this
random variable it. Okay, this it here

926
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
random variable it. Okay, this it here
 

927
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,990
random variable it. Okay, this it here
is now random in this SGD update.

928
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
is now random in this SGD update.
 

929
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,029
is now random in this SGD update.
And so here instead of this xrpose x

930
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
And so here instead of this xrpose x
 

931
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,630
And so here instead of this xrpose x
here, I get this xit xitpose. And

932
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
here, I get this xit xitpose. And
 

933
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,630
here, I get this xit xitpose. And
remember the transposes here are there's

934
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,640
remember the transposes here are there's
 

935
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,029
remember the transposes here are there's
a xrpose x here but this is xxrpose

936
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
a xrpose x here but this is xxrpose
 

937
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,070
a xrpose x here but this is xxrpose
because the matrix x is the rows are the

938
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
because the matrix x is the rows are the
 

939
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,549
because the matrix x is the rows are the
data points right so that's why this

940
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:00,559
data points right so that's why this
 

941
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,149
data points right so that's why this
transpose switching is happening here if

942
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
transpose switching is happening here if
 

943
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,070
transpose switching is happening here if
you're confused about that yes

944
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
you're confused about that yes
 

945
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,710
you're confused about that yes
>> is so data we're going to work with the

because it makes it easy to think about

952
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
because it makes it easy to think about

the least squares example right when you

954
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:13,600
the least squares example right when you
 

955
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,070
the least squares example right when you
have x w equal to y x the row of x * w

956
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,080
have x w equal to y x the row of x * w
 

957
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,909
have x w equal to y x the row of x * w
is equal to y so that's like one row is

958
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
is equal to y so that's like one row is
 

959
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:27,350
is equal to y so that's like one row is
one data point.

960
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360

 

961
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,750

So here what everyone I want and I hope

962
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
So here what everyone I want and I hope
 

963
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,190
So here what everyone I want and I hope
all of you got from this the the

964
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,200
all of you got from this the the
 

965
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,510
all of you got from this the the
discussion with each other is that

966
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
discussion with each other is that
 

967
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,350
discussion with each other is that
there's now a randomness. It's not easy

968
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
there's now a randomness. It's not easy
 

969
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,549
there's now a randomness. It's not easy
to write that equation. You have to

970
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:36,559
to write that equation. You have to
 

971
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,789
to write that equation. You have to
introduce a new variable when you're

972
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799
introduce a new variable when you're
 

973
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,110
introduce a new variable when you're
writing this SGD equation, right?

974
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
writing this SGD equation, right?
 

975
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,710
writing this SGD equation, right?
Because we do not know which data point

976
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
Because we do not know which data point
 

977
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,830
Because we do not know which data point
we are going to get. Okay.

978
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
we are going to get. Okay.
 

979
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,230
we are going to get. Okay.
So now we have this basically dynamical

980
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,240
So now we have this basically dynamical
 

981
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,230
So now we have this basically dynamical
system. This is a dynam this is an

982
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
system. This is a dynam this is an
 

983
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,789
system. This is a dynam this is an
equation that's describing to us how Z

984
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
equation that's describing to us how Z
 

985
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,190
equation that's describing to us how Z
is evolving.

986
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
is evolving.
 

987
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,750
is evolving.
Can we say something about what happens

988
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
Can we say something about what happens
 

989
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,630
Can we say something about what happens
to this loss which is the squared loss

990
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
to this loss which is the squared loss
 

991
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,110
to this loss which is the squared loss
that we care about as we traverse the

992
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
that we care about as we traverse the
 

993
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,149
that we care about as we traverse the
path dictated by this dynamical system.

994
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:06,159
path dictated by this dynamical system.
 

995
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,430

That's what we want to try and

996
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
That's what we want to try and
 

997
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,789
That's what we want to try and
understand. Okay. So it's important to

998
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799
understand. Okay. So it's important to
 

999
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,549

is clear. Yes. Thumbs up, thumbs down.

1010
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
is clear. Yes. Thumbs up, thumbs down.
 

1011
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,269

Okay, good.

1012
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
Okay, good.
 

1013
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,190
Okay, good.
So to show this, what we're going to do

1014
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
So to show this, what we're going to do
 

1015
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,789
So to show this, what we're going to do
is we want to say look at this quantity

1016
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
is we want to say look at this quantity
 

1017
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,950
is we want to say look at this quantity
and what do we know about it? Well, it's

1018
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:34,960
and what do we know about it? Well, it's
 

1019
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,190
and what do we know about it? Well, it's
a square, right? So that means it's

1020
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,200
a square, right? So that means it's
 

1021
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,110
a square, right? So that means it's
always going to be non- negative.

1022
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
always going to be non- negative.
 

1023
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,750
always going to be non- negative.

means I must eventually hit the table,

1107
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,590

you're worried about a case that's like

1108

you're worried about a case that's like
 

1109
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:25,909
you're worried about a case that's like
this, right? Let's see.

1110
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919

 

1111
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,310

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,320
and I go and stop here.
 

1113
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,830
and I go and stop here.

approach something that's above the
 

1119
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,990
approach something that's above the
lower bound?

1120
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,000

1137
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:16,310

Um

1139
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,190

That is a good question. Maybe I am

1140
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
That is a good question. Maybe I am
 

1141
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,950
That is a good question. Maybe I am
missing a condition here that I should

1155
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,990
is a there there is there there has to
be a condition like that. You're

1156
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
be a condition like that. You're
 

1157
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,830
be a condition like that. You're
absolutely right. And maybe I forgot to

1158
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
absolutely right. And maybe I forgot to
 

1159
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,990
absolutely right. And maybe I forgot to
write that down. But yeah, you see the

1160
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,000
write that down. But yeah, you see the
 

1161
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,029
write that down. But yeah, you see the
point you're raising is is correct.

1162
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
point you're raising is is correct.
 

1163
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,230
point you're raising is is correct.
And so you must also show that

1164
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
And so you must also show that
 

1165
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,630
And so you must also show that
this is decreasing

1166
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640
this is decreasing
 

1167
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,950
this is decreasing
fast enough at some appropriate rate.

1168
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:56,960
fast enough at some appropriate rate.
 

1169
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,870
fast enough at some appropriate rate.
That's correct. Yes. Question at the

1170
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,880
That's correct. Yes. Question at the
 

1171

1179
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,389

still hold true?

1180
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:12,399

 

1181
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,310

So you mean for the SGD part?

1182
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:14,320
So you mean for the SGD part?
 

1183
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,870

say that there should be a basically
 

1217
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,710
say that there should be a basically
like you you need to have a condition on

like you you need to have a condition on
 

1219
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,029
like you you need to have a condition on

enough

enough

and I did not write that down. So sorry
 

1227
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,190
and I did not write that down. So sorry
I will correct this and put an updated

1228
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,200
I will correct this and put an updated
 

1229
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,669
I will correct this and put an updated
note um

1230
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:55,679
note um
 

1231
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,310
note um
updated note on the website.

1232
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,320

 

1233
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,190

Okay. But let's proceed forward with

1234
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,200
Okay. But let's proceed forward with
 

1235
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,710
Okay. But let's proceed forward with
what we want to show.

1236
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:06,720
what we want to show.
 

1237
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,110
what we want to show.
So I want to show that this is basically

1238
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
So I want to show that this is basically
 

1239
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,110
So I want to show that this is basically
going down.

1240
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,120
going down.
 

1241
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,590
going down.
For this what I'm going to do is I want

1242
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:13,600
For this what I'm going to do is I want
 

1243
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,630
For this what I'm going to do is I want
to say okay let me look at the loss at

1244
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:16,640
to say okay let me look at the loss at
 

1245
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,750
to say okay let me look at the loss at
time t + one and I want to connect it to

1246
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:19,760
time t + one and I want to connect it to
 

1247
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,870
time t + one and I want to connect it to
the loss at time zt right I want to

1248
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:22,880
the loss at time zt right I want to
 

1249
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,789
the loss at time zt right I want to
basically be able to track the evolution

1250
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:24,799
basically be able to track the evolution
 

1251
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,710
basically be able to track the evolution
of the loss as we go ahead

1252
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
of the loss as we go ahead
 

1253
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,470
of the loss as we go ahead
and to do that I'm going to write this

1254
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
and to do that I'm going to write this
 

1255
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,070
and to do that I'm going to write this
loss function as basically zt plus one.

1256
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,080
loss function as basically zt plus one.
 

1257
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,669
loss function as basically zt plus one.
I'm going to add and subtract ZT so that

1258
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:35,679
I'm going to add and subtract ZT so that
 

1259
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,110
I'm going to add and subtract ZT so that
I can kind of put these connections

1260
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,120
I can kind of put these connections
 

1261
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,430
I can kind of put these connections
together.

1262
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440

 

1263
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,230

And then I can do some algebra which I'm

1264
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,240
And then I can do some algebra which I'm
 

1265
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,870
And then I can do some algebra which I'm
going to not do right here and say that

1266
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
going to not do right here and say that
 

1267
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,950
going to not do right here and say that
I can write this as L of ZT plus some

1268
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
I can write this as L of ZT plus some
 

1269
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,549
I can write this as L of ZT plus some
term A and plus some term B. Okay. And

1270
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
term A and plus some term B. Okay. And
 

1271
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,350
term A and plus some term B. Okay. And
what are these terms A and B? Well, this

1272
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,360
what are these terms A and B? Well, this
 

1273
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,470
what are these terms A and B? Well, this
term A is linear in the update or in the

1274
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:02,480
term A is linear in the update or in the
 

1275
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,710
term A is linear in the update or in the
kind of difference between ZT + one and

1276
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
kind of difference between ZT + one and
 

1277
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,230
kind of difference between ZT + one and
ZT.

1278
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,240
ZT.
 

1279
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,190
ZT.
And so I have A is equal to 2 um ZTRpose

1280
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,200
And so I have A is equal to 2 um ZTRpose
 

1281
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,310
And so I have A is equal to 2 um ZTRpose
XRPOSE X and I have B is equal to ZT + 1

1282
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,320
XRPOSE X and I have B is equal to ZT + 1
 

1283
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,190
XRPOSE X and I have B is equal to ZT + 1
minus ZTRpose XRPOSE X um and again this

1284
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,200
minus ZTRpose XRPOSE X um and again this
 

1285
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,110
minus ZTRpose XRPOSE X um and again this
difference. Okay, so the second term B

1286
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,120
difference. Okay, so the second term B
 

1287
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,750
difference. Okay, so the second term B
is quadratic in the update.

1288
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:25,760
is quadratic in the update.
 

1289
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,990
is quadratic in the update.
And now what we want to think about is

1290
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,000
And now what we want to think about is
 

1291
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,310
And now what we want to think about is
we want to think about what happens to

1292
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,320
we want to think about what happens to
 

1293
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,789
we want to think about what happens to
these when our updates are you know uh

1294
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:34,799
these when our updates are you know uh
 

1295
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,310
these when our updates are you know uh
relatively small because we want

1296
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,320
relatively small because we want
 

1297
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,549
relatively small because we want
gradient descent to be working. So in

1298
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:38,559
gradient descent to be working. So in
 

1299
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,310
gradient descent to be working. So in
this case what we want is we want

1300
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
this case what we want is we want
 

1301
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,149
this case what we want is we want
basically this linear term to dictate

1302
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:44,159
basically this linear term to dictate
 

1303
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,190
basically this linear term to dictate
what's happening because if zt + one is

1304
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,200
what's happening because if zt + one is
 

1305
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,070
what's happening because if zt + one is
very close to zt this is pretty small.

1306
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,080
very close to zt this is pretty small.
 

1307
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,750
very close to zt this is pretty small.
So I want this quadratic term to

1308
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
So I want this quadratic term to
 

1309
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,549
So I want this quadratic term to
essentially be not too big. And I want

1310
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
essentially be not too big. And I want
 

1311
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,029
essentially be not too big. And I want
this step, this term to bring me the DK.

1312
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
this step, this term to bring me the DK.
 

1313
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,870
this step, this term to bring me the DK.
Okay. And I want to say that this term

1314
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:00,880
Okay. And I want to say that this term
 

1315
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,149
Okay. And I want to say that this term
isn't going to undo any progress done by

1316
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:04,159
isn't going to undo any progress done by
 

1317
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,549
isn't going to undo any progress done by
this first term.

1318
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:08,559

 

1319
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,389

So everyone clear on how I'm splitting

1320
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:10,399
So everyone clear on how I'm splitting
 

1321
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,269
So everyone clear on how I'm splitting
this up into two parts?

1322
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
this up into two parts?
 

1323
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,230
this up into two parts?
Okay, good.

1324
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240

 

1325
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,070

So to show this now I'm going to first

1326
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
So to show this now I'm going to first
 

1327
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,070
So to show this now I'm going to first
look at this expected value of a given

1328
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,080
look at this expected value of a given
 

1329
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,789
look at this expected value of a given
ZT. So I want to understand what is

1330
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:26,799
ZT. So I want to understand what is
 

1331
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,389
ZT. So I want to understand what is
happening to this term

1332
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399

 

1333
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,630

when I'm at point ZT. Right? Remember

1334
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:34,640
when I'm at point ZT. Right? Remember
 

1335
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,190
when I'm at point ZT. Right? Remember
what I'm trying to show is how these two

1336
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
what I'm trying to show is how these two
 

1337
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,430
what I'm trying to show is how these two
are connected to each other. And for

1338
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:39,440
are connected to each other. And for
 

1339
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,070
are connected to each other. And for
this I have to show that A plus B is

1340
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,080
this I have to show that A plus B is
 

1341
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,230
this I have to show that A plus B is
basically essentially negative. Right?

1342
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,240
basically essentially negative. Right?
 

1343
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,310
basically essentially negative. Right?
because then I can show that I have I'm

1344
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,320
because then I can show that I have I'm
 

1345
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,630
because then I can show that I have I'm
always going down.

1346
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:48,640
always going down.
 

1347
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:55,269
always going down.
Does everyone see that?

1348
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:55,279

 

1349
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,669

Okay. So now to understand what I'm

1350
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:57,679
Okay. So now to understand what I'm
 

1351
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,350
Okay. So now to understand what I'm
going to do with this expected value of

1352
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,360
going to do with this expected value of
 

1353
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,029
going to do with this expected value of
a,

1354
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
a,
 

1355
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,710
a,
I have the expected value of a given ZT.

1356
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:04,720
I have the expected value of a given ZT.
 

1357
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,710
I have the expected value of a given ZT.
And why am I taking this expected value

1358
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:06,720
And why am I taking this expected value
 

1359
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,909
And why am I taking this expected value
here? This expected value, what is the

1360
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:09,919
here? This expected value, what is the
 

1361
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,590
here? This expected value, what is the
only randomness in the problem? Is there

1362
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:11,600
only randomness in the problem? Is there
 

1363
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,190
only randomness in the problem? Is there
any noise in our evolution that is being

1364
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
any noise in our evolution that is being
 

1365
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,509
any noise in our evolution that is being
externally added? There is none. Right?

1366
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:15,519
externally added? There is none. Right?
 

1367
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,630
externally added? There is none. Right?
The only randomness is coming from the

1368
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:18,640
The only randomness is coming from the
 

1369
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,070
The only randomness is coming from the
SGD step. There's nothing else that's

1370
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
SGD step. There's nothing else that's
 

1371
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,909
SGD step. There's nothing else that's
that that this expectation is only over

1372
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:23,919
that that this expectation is only over
 

1373
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,789
that that this expectation is only over
that. Okay? So that's important to to

1374
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:26,799
that. Okay? So that's important to to
 

1375
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,750
that. Okay? So that's important to to
keep in mind.

1376
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
keep in mind.
 

1377
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,230
keep in mind.
How do we then go about handling this?

1378
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,240
How do we then go about handling this?
 

1379
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,310
How do we then go about handling this?
Well,

1380
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,320
Well,
 

1381
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,310
Well,
I take this a term and I just put it in

1382
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
I take this a term and I just put it in
 

1383
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,549
I take this a term and I just put it in
here, right?

1384
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:38,559
here, right?
 

1385
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,630
here, right?
This is exactly a

1386
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:42,640

 

1387
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,710

And now I'm conditioning on ZT.

1388
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:46,720
And now I'm conditioning on ZT.
 

1389
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,830
And now I'm conditioning on ZT.
So ZT transpose is a direct function of

1390
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:49,840
So ZT transpose is a direct function of
 

1391
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,509
So ZT transpose is a direct function of
it. It just pops out of the expectation.

1392
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:51,519
it. It just pops out of the expectation.
 

1393
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,549
it. It just pops out of the expectation.
It's like a constant.

1394
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:54,559
It's like a constant.
 

1395
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,430
It's like a constant.
XRPOSE X is just our data. It has no

1396
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:57,440
XRPOSE X is just our data. It has no
 

1397
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,190
XRPOSE X is just our data. It has no
dependence on where my gradient descent

1398
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200
dependence on where my gradient descent
 

1399
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,070
dependence on where my gradient descent
is. So it pops out of the expectation.

1400
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,080
is. So it pops out of the expectation.
 

1401
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,830
is. So it pops out of the expectation.
So only thing that's left inside this

1402
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
So only thing that's left inside this
 

1403
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,950
So only thing that's left inside this
expectation is this ZT + 1 minus ZT.

1404
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:06,960
expectation is this ZT + 1 minus ZT.
 

1405
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,389
expectation is this ZT + 1 minus ZT.
Right?

1406
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:08,399
Right?
 

1407
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,110
Right?
Okay,

1408
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,120
Okay,
 

1409
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,630
Okay,
but now I can use my update equation

1410
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
but now I can use my update equation
 

1411
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,190
but now I can use my update equation
to basically substitute

1412
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,200
to basically substitute
 

1413
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,990
to basically substitute
the value of the update into here. So

1414
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:20,000
the value of the update into here. So
 

1415
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,350
the value of the update into here. So
that's basically minus 2 ADA

1416
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
that's basically minus 2 ADA
 

1417
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,990
that's basically minus 2 ADA
times the expected value of the data

1418
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
times the expected value of the data
 

1419
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,149
times the expected value of the data
point that I've chosen times ZT which

1420
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:28,159
point that I've chosen times ZT which
 

1421
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,909
point that I've chosen times ZT which
also pops out of the expectation.

1422
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:31,919
also pops out of the expectation.
 

1423
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,789
also pops out of the expectation.
So only thing that remains to understand

1424
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:34,799
So only thing that remains to understand
 

1425
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,029
So only thing that remains to understand
is this quantity which is the expected

1426
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:37,039
is this quantity which is the expected
 

1427
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,950
is this quantity which is the expected
value of this um outer product of a data

1428
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:42,960
value of this um outer product of a data
 

1429
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,509
value of this um outer product of a data
point with itself.

1430
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:47,519

 

1431
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,909

So when I look at this this is what I

1432
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:49,919
So when I look at this this is what I
 

1433
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,029
So when I look at this this is what I
have right there. I want to look at this

1434
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,039
have right there. I want to look at this
 

1435
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,590
have right there. I want to look at this
expected value of x twiddle it x twiddle

1436
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:55,600
expected value of x twiddle it x twiddle
 

1437
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,789
expected value of x twiddle it x twiddle
transpose it. And just as a reminder

1438
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:58,799
transpose it. And just as a reminder
 

1439
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,950
transpose it. And just as a reminder
this is a column times a row right? So

1440
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:00,960
this is a column times a row right? So
 

1441
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,789
this is a column times a row right? So
this is giving me a matrix here.

1442
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:04,799
this is giving me a matrix here.
 

1443
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,389
this is giving me a matrix here.
So how can I understand this

1444
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
So how can I understand this
 

1445
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,950
So how can I understand this
expectation?

1446
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:08,960
expectation?
 

1447
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,470
expectation?
Is this obvious to everyone about this

1448
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
Is this obvious to everyone about this
 

1449
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,829
Is this obvious to everyone about this
expectation or is this like wait I need

1450
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
expectation or is this like wait I need
 

1451
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,190
expectation or is this like wait I need
to think about this? Just give me a

1452
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,200
to think about this? Just give me a
 

1453
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,669
to think about this? Just give me a
sense of where everyone's at.

1454
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:17,679

 

1455
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,909

Okay. So let's walk through this. So

1456
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:21,919
Okay. So let's walk through this. So
 

1457
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,710
Okay. So let's walk through this. So
this expectation here, what is this?

1458
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:24,720
this expectation here, what is this?
 

1459
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,589
this expectation here, what is this?
This is now I'm pulling a data point,

1460
00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:27,599
This is now I'm pulling a data point,
 

1461
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,750
This is now I'm pulling a data point,
right? SGD is picking me batch size one.

1462
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:29,760
right? SGD is picking me batch size one.
 

1463
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,430
right? SGD is picking me batch size one.
So I'm picking a data point and I'm

1464
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:31,440
So I'm picking a data point and I'm
 

1465
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,950
So I'm picking a data point and I'm
going to traverse the gradient in that

1466
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:32,960
going to traverse the gradient in that
 

1467
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,589
going to traverse the gradient in that
direction. So this it is what my random

1468
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
direction. So this it is what my random
 

1469
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,990
direction. So this it is what my random
variable is. So that means that it could

1470
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,000
variable is. So that means that it could
 

1471
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,430
variable is. So that means that it could
be one or it could be two or it could be

1472
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:39,440
be one or it could be two or it could be
 

1473
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,710
be one or it could be two or it could be
three or it could be four or it could be

1474
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:40,720
three or it could be four or it could be
 

1475
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,470
three or it could be four or it could be
n, right? I have exactly n choices

1476
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:42,480
n, right? I have exactly n choices
 

1477
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,950
n, right? I have exactly n choices
because I have n data points. Everyone

1478
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:44,960
because I have n data points. Everyone
 

1479
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,790
because I have n data points. Everyone
with me there?

1480
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
with me there?
 

1481
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,710
with me there?
Yes. No.

1482
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:48,720
Yes. No.
 

1483
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,869
Yes. No.
Okay. Good.

1484
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:50,879
Okay. Good.
 

1485
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,470
Okay. Good.
So I say, well, what does it mean to

1486
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:52,480
So I say, well, what does it mean to
 

1487
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,829
So I say, well, what does it mean to
take the expected value? Well, what is

1488
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
take the expected value? Well, what is
 

1489
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,030
take the expected value? Well, what is
the probability that I take the first

1490
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
the probability that I take the first
 

1491
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,950
the probability that I take the first
guy is 1 /n. The probability to take the

1492
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:56,960
guy is 1 /n. The probability to take the
 

1493
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,870
guy is 1 /n. The probability to take the
second guy is 1 overn. So I have this 1

1494
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:58,880
second guy is 1 overn. So I have this 1
 

1495
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,510
second guy is 1 overn. So I have this 1
/ n here

1496
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,520
/ n here
 

1497
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,030
/ n here
and then the probability that this is

1498
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,040
and then the probability that this is
 

1499
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,630
and then the probability that this is
one is 1 / n. The probability this is

1500
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
one is 1 / n. The probability this is
 

1501
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,829
one is 1 / n. The probability this is
two is 1 over n and the probability this

1502
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:05,839
two is 1 over n and the probability this
 

1503
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,910
two is 1 over n and the probability this
is three is 1 overn. I get this term

1504
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
is three is 1 overn. I get this term
 

1505
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,109
is three is 1 overn. I get this term
here. Okay.

1506
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,119
here. Okay.
 

1507
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,870
here. Okay.
But now what is this? This is just these

1508
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:12,880
But now what is this? This is just these
 

1509
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,589
But now what is this? This is just these
outer products of these data points.

1510
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
outer products of these data points.
 

1511
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,589
outer products of these data points.
That's exactly just xrpose x, right?

1512
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:19,599
That's exactly just xrpose x, right?
 

1513
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,150
That's exactly just xrpose x, right?
So that's just doing that's just another

1514
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,160
So that's just doing that's just another
 

1515
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,470
So that's just doing that's just another
way of writing exactly this. And so this

1516
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:24,480
way of writing exactly this. And so this
 

1517
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,550
way of writing exactly this. And so this
expected value is just 1 / n times that.

1518
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560
expected value is just 1 / n times that.
 

1519
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,750
expected value is just 1 / n times that.
Okay. So it just a very nice thing just

1520
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760
Okay. So it just a very nice thing just
 

1521
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,950
Okay. So it just a very nice thing just
kind of pops out uh there for you. And

1522
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:34,960
kind of pops out uh there for you. And
 

1523
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,990
kind of pops out uh there for you. And
so when I substitute that back in,

1524
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,000
so when I substitute that back in,
 

1525
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,190
so when I substitute that back in,
what I get now is I get that this

1526
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,200
what I get now is I get that this
 

1527
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,190
what I get now is I get that this
expected value of a given ZT

1528
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
expected value of a given ZT
 

1529
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,230
expected value of a given ZT
is I pull all the constants together

1530
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,240
is I pull all the constants together
 

1531
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,390
is I pull all the constants together
over here. And now I have this ZTRpose

1532
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:52,400
over here. And now I have this ZTRpose
 

1533
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,030
over here. And now I have this ZTRpose
that comes from here. I already had one

1534
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
that comes from here. I already had one
 

1535
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,230
that comes from here. I already had one
xrpose X and now this expectation has

1536
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,240
xrpose X and now this expectation has
 

1537
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,349
xrpose X and now this expectation has
given me a second Xrpose X and I have

1538
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:01,359
given me a second Xrpose X and I have
 

1539
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,790
given me a second Xrpose X and I have
this ZT from here that comes over here.

1540
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:04,800
this ZT from here that comes over here.
 

1541
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,950
this ZT from here that comes over here.
Okay.

1542
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:06,960
Okay.
 

1543
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,430
Okay.
Now is so this was this expectation is

1544
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:09,440
Now is so this was this expectation is
 

1545
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,870
Now is so this was this expectation is
the first interesting thing that I want

1546
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:10,880
the first interesting thing that I want
 

1547
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,390
the first interesting thing that I want
you to understand and notice that's

1548
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:12,400
you to understand and notice that's
 

1549
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,710
you to understand and notice that's
coming from the randomness of SGD. The

1550
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:14,720
coming from the randomness of SGD. The
 

1551
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,150
coming from the randomness of SGD. The
second interesting thing that I want you

1552
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,160
second interesting thing that I want you
 

1553
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,510
second interesting thing that I want you
to understand and notice is what's

1554
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:17,520
to understand and notice is what's
 

1555
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,990
to understand and notice is what's
happening here. So I'm looking at this

1556
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,000
happening here. So I'm looking at this
 

1557
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,390
happening here. So I'm looking at this
expression and I'm trying to think well

1558
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:22,400
expression and I'm trying to think well
 

1559
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,790
expression and I'm trying to think well
how do I analyze this? What can I do

1560
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:24,800
how do I analyze this? What can I do
 

1561
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,990
how do I analyze this? What can I do
with something like this?

1562
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,000
with something like this?
 

1563
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,510
with something like this?
It's kind of unwieldy. There's a lot

1564
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
It's kind of unwieldy. There's a lot
 

1565
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,550
It's kind of unwieldy. There's a lot
going on. What I want to say is let's

1566
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:32,560
going on. What I want to say is let's
 

1567
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,710
going on. What I want to say is let's
pick out and let's look at xrpose x and

1568
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:36,720
pick out and let's look at xrpose x and
 

1569
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,550
pick out and let's look at xrpose x and
what it's doing to this matrix dt.

1570
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:40,560
what it's doing to this matrix dt.
 

1571
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,470
what it's doing to this matrix dt.
What do I know about xrpose x? Well, I

1572
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:42,480
What do I know about xrpose x? Well, I
 

1573
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,109
What do I know about xrpose x? Well, I
know something about I I can I can

1574
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:45,119
know something about I I can I can
 

1575
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,589
know something about I I can I can
characterize what this is doing to this

1576
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
characterize what this is doing to this
 

1577
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,190
characterize what this is doing to this
vector in terms of the singular values,

1578
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,200
vector in terms of the singular values,
 

1579
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,550
vector in terms of the singular values,
right?

1580
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:52,560
right?
 

1581
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:59,910
right?
And I know actually

1582
00:36:59,910 --> 00:36:59,920

 

1583
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,150

that when I think about this matrix

1584
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
that when I think about this matrix
 

1585
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,829
that when I think about this matrix
xrpose x and what does it do to a

1586
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:05,839
xrpose x and what does it do to a
 

1587
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,230
xrpose x and what does it do to a
vector? Well, I know it's lower bounded

1588
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,240
vector? Well, I know it's lower bounded
 

1589
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,430
vector? Well, I know it's lower bounded
by the smallest singular value and it's

1590
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:11,440
by the smallest singular value and it's
 

1591
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,349
by the smallest singular value and it's
upper bounded by the largest singular

1592
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:13,359
upper bounded by the largest singular
 

1593
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,030
upper bounded by the largest singular
value.

1594
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,040
value.
 

1595
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,750
value.
Right? Everyone see that?

1596
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:17,760
Right? Everyone see that?
 

1597
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,630
Right? Everyone see that?
So I can basically say look therefore if

1598
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
So I can basically say look therefore if
 

1599
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,790
So I can basically say look therefore if
I multip here I have this negative sign

1600
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
I multip here I have this negative sign
 

1601
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,109
I multip here I have this negative sign
and so I want to say that this sigma

1602
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:25,119
and so I want to say that this sigma
 

1603
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,349
and so I want to say that this sigma
min^ 2 * z is actually greater than or

1604
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:29,359
min^ 2 * z is actually greater than or
 

1605
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,310
min^ 2 * z is actually greater than or
equal to this minus xrpose x * z. Okay

1606
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,320
equal to this minus xrpose x * z. Okay
 

1607
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,910
equal to this minus xrpose x * z. Okay
so I can substitute this with this upper

1608
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
so I can substitute this with this upper
 

1609
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,950
so I can substitute this with this upper
bound of sigma min^ 2 times this zt.

1610
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:42,960
bound of sigma min^ 2 times this zt.
 

1611
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,589
bound of sigma min^ 2 times this zt.
Does that make sense to everyone?

1612
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:45,599
Does that make sense to everyone?
 

1613
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,270
Does that make sense to everyone?
I'm just saying what is the worst that

1614
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,280
I'm just saying what is the worst that
 

1615
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,990
I'm just saying what is the worst that
this vector can do

1616
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,000
this vector can do
 

1617
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,829
this vector can do
and I want you to focus on understanding

1618
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:51,839
and I want you to focus on understanding
 

1619
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,109
and I want you to focus on understanding
these kinds of things because this is

1620
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
these kinds of things because this is
 

1621
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,349
these kinds of things because this is
going to become important as we come in

1622
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:55,359
going to become important as we come in
 

1623
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,109
going to become important as we come in
the next few lectures that's coming up

1624
00:37:59,109 --> 00:37:59,119
the next few lectures that's coming up
 

1625
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,950
the next few lectures that's coming up
but now when I look at this particular

1626
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:00,960
but now when I look at this particular
 

1627
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,630
but now when I look at this particular
expression here this is just my loss

1628
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:02,640
expression here this is just my loss
 

1629
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,349
expression here this is just my loss
function so I can substitute that in and

1630
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,359
function so I can substitute that in and
 

1631
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,030
function so I can substitute that in and
so I have minus 4 a / n this expression

1632
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,040
so I have minus 4 a / n this expression
 

1633
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,630
so I have minus 4 a / n this expression
here okay

1634
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:12,640
here okay
 

1635
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,710
here okay
everyone with me on that clear

1636
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:16,720
everyone with me on that clear
 

1637
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,270
everyone with me on that clear
for the second term. The second term is

1638
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,280
for the second term. The second term is
 

1639
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,310
for the second term. The second term is
now quadratic in this error and I'm not

1640
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:22,320
now quadratic in this error and I'm not
 

1641
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,589
now quadratic in this error and I'm not
going to go through it in as much

1642
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:23,599
going to go through it in as much
 

1643
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,870
going to go through it in as much
detail. It's going to be on the

1644
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:24,880
detail. It's going to be on the
 

1645
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,349
detail. It's going to be on the
homework. But what I want to point out

1646
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:27,359
homework. But what I want to point out
 

1647
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,910
homework. But what I want to point out
again is that here we want to show an

1648
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:29,920
again is that here we want to show an
 

1649
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,910
again is that here we want to show an
inequality of this sort.

1650
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:33,920

 

1651
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,510

Again, what's going to show up is you're

1652
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
Again, what's going to show up is you're
 

1653
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,069
Again, what's going to show up is you're
going to get an xrpose x ter like term

1654
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:38,079
going to get an xrpose x ter like term
 

1655
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,910
going to get an xrpose x ter like term
which is actually in the b term and

1656
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:39,920
which is actually in the b term and
 

1657
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,589
which is actually in the b term and
again you're going to use the singular

1658
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:41,599
again you're going to use the singular
 

1659
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,470
again you're going to use the singular
value to say what is the worst that this

1660
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:44,480
value to say what is the worst that this
 

1661
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,430
value to say what is the worst that this
particular can do this particular uh

1662
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:47,440
particular can do this particular uh
 

1663
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,069
particular can do this particular uh
matrix can do but now you're you're

1664
00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:50,079
matrix can do but now you're you're
 

1665
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,270
matrix can do but now you're you're
trying to show that this is smaller than

1666
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,280
trying to show that this is smaller than
 

1667
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,550
trying to show that this is smaller than
the positive quantity you don't have

1668
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
the positive quantity you don't have
 

1669
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,150
the positive quantity you don't have
this negative sign hanging around and so

1670
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,160
this negative sign hanging around and so
 

1671
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,589
this negative sign hanging around and so
you're going to end up with the largest

1672
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:55,599
you're going to end up with the largest
 

1673
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,069
you're going to end up with the largest
singular value.

1674
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:58,079
singular value.
 

1675
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,270
singular value.
You're going to do a little bit more

1676
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,280
You're going to do a little bit more
 

1677
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,270
You're going to do a little bit more
processing and what you're going to see

1678
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:01,280
processing and what you're going to see
 

1679
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,230
processing and what you're going to see
is this term of this form where this is

1680
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,240
is this term of this form where this is
 

1681
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,030
is this term of this form where this is
again all that all the randomness here

1682
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,040
again all that all the randomness here
 

1683
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,190
again all that all the randomness here
is coming from this data point that

1684
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,200
is coming from this data point that
 

1685
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,150
is coming from this data point that
you're choosing. So you have this

1686
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,160
you're choosing. So you have this
 

1687
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,270
you're choosing. So you have this
expected value of x xrpose x xrpose.

1688
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:15,280
expected value of x xrpose x xrpose.
 

1689
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,950
expected value of x xrpose x xrpose.
Again

1690
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:16,960
Again
 

1691
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,630
Again
the nice thing here is that because I

1692
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:18,640
the nice thing here is that because I
 

1693
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,349
the nice thing here is that because I
have four of these in the middle I have

1694
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:21,359
have four of these in the middle I have
 

1695
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,190
have four of these in the middle I have
not an outer product but now I have an

1696
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,200
not an outer product but now I have an
 

1697
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,790
not an outer product but now I have an
inner product here. Right? So I can take

1698
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:26,800
inner product here. Right? So I can take
 

1699
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,550
inner product here. Right? So I can take
these two and I group them together and

1700
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:28,560
these two and I group them together and
 

1701
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,870
these two and I group them together and
what do I get?

1702
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:30,880
what do I get?
 

1703
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,829
what do I get?
I get the norm of my data points. And

1704
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:33,839
I get the norm of my data points. And
 

1705
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,750
I get the norm of my data points. And
now if I can say that this norm is

1706
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:39,760
now if I can say that this norm is
 

1707
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,150
now if I can say that this norm is
not too large

1708
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,160
not too large
 

1709
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,349
not too large
then I or if I can bound this

1710
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
then I or if I can bound this
 

1711
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,790
then I or if I can bound this
I can use that norm to get a appropriate

1712
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:48,800
I can use that norm to get a appropriate
 

1713
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,510
I can use that norm to get a appropriate
bound. Okay, that's the general gist and

1714
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:53,520
bound. Okay, that's the general gist and
 

1715
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,109
bound. Okay, that's the general gist and
way in which this proof is going to go

1716
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:55,119
way in which this proof is going to go
 

1717
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,150
way in which this proof is going to go
through.

1718
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,160

 

1719
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,230

So the thing I want to point out here is

1720
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,240
So the thing I want to point out here is
 

1721
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,030
So the thing I want to point out here is
two things

1722
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,040
two things
 

1723
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,510
two things
is that first we care about these

1724
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:05,520
is that first we care about these
 

1725
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,910
is that first we care about these
singular values and second the size of

1726
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:09,920
singular values and second the size of
 

1727
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,550
singular values and second the size of
the data points also comes in and we

1728
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
the data points also comes in and we
 

1729
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,950
the data points also comes in and we
will talk about normalization

1730
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:14,960
will talk about normalization
 

1731
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,670
will talk about normalization
um in the coming lectures and this is

1732
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:17,680
um in the coming lectures and this is
 

1733
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,910
um in the coming lectures and this is
one place where you can see in an easy

1734
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:19,920
one place where you can see in an easy
 

1735
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,310
one place where you can see in an easy
way that well you know the sizes of your

1736
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:22,320
way that well you know the sizes of your
 

1737
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,069
way that well you know the sizes of your
data points are actually going to matter

1738
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:24,079
data points are actually going to matter
 

1739
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,829
data points are actually going to matter
in terms of whether you can converge or

1740
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:25,839
in terms of whether you can converge or
 

1741
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,069
in terms of whether you can converge or
not because how the nonlinearities are

1742
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:28,079
not because how the nonlinearities are
 

1743
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,069
not because how the nonlinearities are
going to affect your data points is

1744
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
going to affect your data points is
 

1745
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,990
going to affect your data points is
going to is going to come in. Okay.

1746
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:34,000
going to is going to come in. Okay.
 

1747
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,270
going to is going to come in. Okay.
So then you can put this all together

1748
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:37,280
So then you can put this all together
 

1749
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,190
So then you can put this all together
adding this up and I can basically show

1750
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,200
adding this up and I can basically show
 

1751
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,829
adding this up and I can basically show
that my loss conditioned on ZT my loss

1752
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:41,839
that my loss conditioned on ZT my loss
 

1753
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,670
that my loss conditioned on ZT my loss
at ZT + one is basically this quadratic

1754
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:45,680
at ZT + one is basically this quadratic
 

1755
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,349
at ZT + one is basically this quadratic
times the loss at this is a typo here.

1756
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:49,359
times the loss at this is a typo here.
 

1757
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,670
times the loss at this is a typo here.
This should be ZT

1758
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:53,680

 

1759
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,430

at ZT.

1760
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
at ZT.
 

1761
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,589
at ZT.
And here I have this ADA here. But if I

1762
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:57,599
And here I have this ADA here. But if I
 

1763
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,750
And here I have this ADA here. But if I
choose an ADA

1764
00:40:59,750 --> 00:40:59,760
choose an ADA
 

1765
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,230
choose an ADA
small enough sorry then I can make sure

1766
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:02,240
small enough sorry then I can make sure
 

1767
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,670
small enough sorry then I can make sure
that this whole thing is smaller than

1768
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:03,680
that this whole thing is smaller than
 

1769
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,750
that this whole thing is smaller than
one.

1770
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:05,760
one.
 

1771
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,990
one.
And so basically if my step size is

1772
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,000
And so basically if my step size is
 

1773
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,670
And so basically if my step size is
small enough I can guarantee that this

1774
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:09,680
small enough I can guarantee that this
 

1775
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,230
small enough I can guarantee that this
converges.

1776
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:16,240

 

1777
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,550

So what we have here is now the

1778
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:18,560
So what we have here is now the
 

1779
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,630
So what we have here is now the
takeaways are we have an interesting

1780
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:20,640
takeaways are we have an interesting
 

1781
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,430
takeaways are we have an interesting
dependence on the norms of the data

1782
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:23,440
dependence on the norms of the data
 

1783
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,790
dependence on the norms of the data
points. Right? That's something that we

1784
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:24,800
points. Right? That's something that we
 

1785
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,470
points. Right? That's something that we
haven't seen before. the sizes of the

1786
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:26,480
haven't seen before. the sizes of the
 

1787
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,870
haven't seen before. the sizes of the
data points mattering for a convergence

1788
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:28,880
data points mattering for a convergence
 

1789
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,950
data points mattering for a convergence
proof. So I want to highlight that and

1790
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:30,960
proof. So I want to highlight that and
 

1791
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,270
proof. So I want to highlight that and
and bring that out and again coming back

1792
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,280
and bring that out and again coming back
 

1793
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,630
and bring that out and again coming back
to the same point that we've been seeing

1794
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:34,640
to the same point that we've been seeing
 

1795
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,870
to the same point that we've been seeing
over and over again that you know

1796
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:36,880
over and over again that you know
 

1797
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,109
over and over again that you know
decoupling into the SVD coordinates can

1798
00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:39,119
decoupling into the SVD coordinates can
 

1799
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,309
decoupling into the SVD coordinates can
help us bring things out.

1800
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:42,319
help us bring things out.
 

1801
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,670
help us bring things out.
Okay. So a very close version of this is

1802
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:45,680
Okay. So a very close version of this is
 

1803
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,430
Okay. So a very close version of this is
going to be on your homework. So you

1804
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:47,440
going to be on your homework. So you
 

1805
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,870
going to be on your homework. So you
will have to go through this in somewhat

1806
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:48,880
will have to go through this in somewhat
 

1807
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,950
will have to go through this in somewhat
some level of detail. I want to give you

1808
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:50,960
some level of detail. I want to give you
 

1809
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,190
some level of detail. I want to give you
a a highlevel idea so that when you're

1810
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:53,200
a a highlevel idea so that when you're
 

1811
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,270
a a highlevel idea so that when you're
doing that homework problem, I don't

1812
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,280
doing that homework problem, I don't
 

1813
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,230
doing that homework problem, I don't
want you to be focusing on the algebra.

1814
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:58,240
want you to be focusing on the algebra.
 

1815
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,750
want you to be focusing on the algebra.
I mean, okay, I do want you to be

1816
00:41:59,750 --> 00:41:59,760
I mean, okay, I do want you to be
 

1817
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,829
I mean, okay, I do want you to be
focusing on all the algebra, but I also

1818
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:01,839
focusing on all the algebra, but I also
 

1819
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,470
focusing on all the algebra, but I also
want you to be getting the big picture

1820
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:04,480
want you to be getting the big picture
 

1821
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,630
want you to be getting the big picture
of what's going on and why you're doing

1822
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:06,640
of what's going on and why you're doing
 

1823
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,470

the algebra, not just the algebra for

1824
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:08,480
the algebra, not just the algebra for
 

1825
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,309
the algebra, not just the algebra for
the sake of the algebra. Make sense?

1826
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:10,319
the sake of the algebra. Make sense?
 

1827
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:10,950

Yes.

1828
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:10,960
Yes.
 

1829
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,550
Yes.

1883
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,349
>> Um
you could uh this is the easier proof.

1884
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:41,359
you could uh this is the easier proof.
 

1885
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,190
you could uh this is the easier proof.
I mean there's I I'm not claiming this

1886
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,200
I mean there's I I'm not claiming this
 

1887
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,829
I mean there's I I'm not claiming this
is the unique proof for this.

1888
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:45,839
is the unique proof for this.
 

1889
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,510
is the unique proof for this.
Yeah, there might be another there might

1890
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
Yeah, there might be another there might
 

1891
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,390
Yeah, there might be another there might
be another proof. In fact, if you want a

1892
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
be another proof. In fact, if you want a
 

1893
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,710
be another proof. In fact, if you want a
story, um we were playing with this

1894
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:52,720
story, um we were playing with this
 

1895
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,670
story, um we were playing with this
proof and trying to uh actually get GPT

1896
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
proof and trying to uh actually get GPT
 

1897
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,270
proof and trying to uh actually get GPT
to see if it could come up with an

1898
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:57,280
to see if it could come up with an
 

1899
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,870
to see if it could come up with an
alternate proof that is simplistic.

1900
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:00,880
alternate proof that is simplistic.
 

1901
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,470
alternate proof that is simplistic.
And turns out that uh you can talk to

1902
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:04,480
And turns out that uh you can talk to
 

1903
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,990
And turns out that uh you can talk to
GPD and try GPT GPD. No, it wasn't GPD5.

1904
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
GPD and try GPT GPD. No, it wasn't GPD5.
 

1905
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,109
GPD and try GPT GPD. No, it wasn't GPD5.
It was Gemini Pro. Gemini 2.5 Pro.

1906
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:13,119
It was Gemini Pro. Gemini 2.5 Pro.
 

1907
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,790
It was Gemini Pro. Gemini 2.5 Pro.
And

1908
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:14,800
And
 

1909
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,470
And
as far as I think Gemini 2.4 for pro

1910
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:18,480
as far as I think Gemini 2.4 for pro
 

1911
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,270
as far as I think Gemini 2.4 for pro
produced a different but correct proof

1912
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:23,280
produced a different but correct proof
 

1913
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,950
produced a different but correct proof
uh approximately correct proof for

1914
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
uh approximately correct proof for
 

1915
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,589
uh approximately correct proof for
for the problem. So

1916
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:29,599
for the problem. So
 

1917
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,309
for the problem. So
I chose not to do that one because it

1918
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:32,319
I chose not to do that one because it
 

1919
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,790
I chose not to do that one because it
doesn't bring out the it's it's a more

1920
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:34,800
doesn't bring out the it's it's a more
 

1921
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,950
doesn't bring out the it's it's a more
crude bound and it doesn't bring out the

1922
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:36,960
crude bound and it doesn't bring out the
 

1923
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,870
crude bound and it doesn't bring out the
dependence on the SVD. So this is

1924
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
dependence on the SVD. So this is
 

1925
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,750
dependence on the SVD. So this is
definitely not the only uh elementary

1926
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:41,760
definitely not the only uh elementary
 

1927
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,750
definitely not the only uh elementary
proof for this.

1928
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,760

 

1929
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,390

Okay, great.

1930
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:52,400

 

1931
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,950

With that, I will now move to the next

1932
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:54,960
With that, I will now move to the next
 

1933
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,510
With that, I will now move to the next
part of the lecture. Um, any questions

1934
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:57,520
part of the lecture. Um, any questions
 

1935
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:06,230
part of the lecture. Um, any questions
about this SGD stuff before I move on?

1936
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:06,240

 

1937
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,109

So, we talked last class about momentum

1938
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:09,119
So, we talked last class about momentum
 

1939
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,870
So, we talked last class about momentum
and I said that I would talk about atom

1940
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:10,880
and I said that I would talk about atom
 

1941
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,470
and I said that I would talk about atom
in today's lecture, which is what I'm

1942
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:12,480
in today's lecture, which is what I'm
 

1943
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,230
in today's lecture, which is what I'm
going to do.

1944
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,240
going to do.
 

1945
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,630
going to do.
What we said last time was that gradient

1946
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,640
What we said last time was that gradient
 

1947
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,349
What we said last time was that gradient
descent has basically a feature and a

1948
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:19,359
descent has basically a feature and a
 

1949
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,990
descent has basically a feature and a
bug which is that it takes larger steps

1950
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,000
bug which is that it takes larger steps
 

1951
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,510
bug which is that it takes larger steps
in the direction of the large singular

1952
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
in the direction of the large singular
 

1953
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,910
in the direction of the large singular
values and it takes smaller steps in the

1954
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:25,920
values and it takes smaller steps in the
 

1955
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,910
values and it takes smaller steps in the
direction of the smaller singular

1956
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:27,920
direction of the smaller singular
 

1957
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,829
direction of the smaller singular
values. And there are advantages and

1958
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:29,839
values. And there are advantages and
 

1959
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,309
values. And there are advantages and
disadvantages to this. For example, you

1960
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:32,319
disadvantages to this. For example, you
 

1961
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:33,670
disadvantages to this. For example, you
know, it leads to this implicit

1962
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
know, it leads to this implicit
 

1963
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,069
know, it leads to this implicit
regularization if we kind of do some uh

1964
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:36,079
regularization if we kind of do some uh
 

1965
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,589
regularization if we kind of do some uh
early stopping. At the same time,

1966
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:39,599
early stopping. At the same time,
 

1967
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,430
early stopping. At the same time,
this can make it very hard to choose a

1968
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
this can make it very hard to choose a
 

1969
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,910
this can make it very hard to choose a
learning rate if you have a very, excuse

1970
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:43,920
learning rate if you have a very, excuse
 

1971
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,589
learning rate if you have a very, excuse
me, if you have a very wide spread of

1972
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:45,599
me, if you have a very wide spread of
 

1973
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,430
me, if you have a very wide spread of
singular values. There might be some

1974
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,440
singular values. There might be some
 

1975
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,349
singular values. There might be some
tiny singular values that you don't care

1976
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:49,359
tiny singular values that you don't care
 

1977
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,109
tiny singular values that you don't care
whether you move in those or not. But

1978
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:51,119
whether you move in those or not. But
 

1979
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,390
whether you move in those or not. But
you might still have some medium

1980
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:52,400
you might still have some medium
 

1981
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,790
you might still have some medium
singular values. And if you choose a

1982
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:54,800
singular values. And if you choose a
 

1983
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,190
singular values. And if you choose a
learning rate that is dominated that is

1984
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:57,200
learning rate that is dominated that is
 

1985
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,589
learning rate that is dominated that is
dictated by your largest singular value,

1986
00:45:59,589 --> 00:45:59,599
dictated by your largest singular value,
 

1987
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,990
dictated by your largest singular value,
you might make extremely so slow

1988
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,000
you might make extremely so slow
 

1989
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,150
you might make extremely so slow
progress in these other directions where

1990
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:04,160
progress in these other directions where
 

1991
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,150
progress in these other directions where
you still want to move but you cannot

1992
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,160
you still want to move but you cannot
 

1993
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,990
you still want to move but you cannot
move fast enough. Right? So this there's

1994
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:08,000
move fast enough. Right? So this there's
 

1995
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,069
move fast enough. Right? So this there's
this challenge in terms of uh choosing

1996
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:10,079
this challenge in terms of uh choosing
 

1997
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,069
this challenge in terms of uh choosing
the learning rate because if you if you

1998
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
the learning rate because if you if you
 

1999
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,309
the learning rate because if you if you
try to uh have a larger learning rate

2000
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:14,319
try to uh have a larger learning rate
 

2001
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,829
try to uh have a larger learning rate
then you might blow up in the directions

2002
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:15,839
then you might blow up in the directions
 

2003
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,109
then you might blow up in the directions
of the large singular values.

2004
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:19,119
of the large singular values.
 

2005
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,510
of the large singular values.
So how could you solve this? Actually

2006
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
So how could you solve this? Actually
 

2007
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,750
So how could you solve this? Actually
why don't I I'm going to actually I yeah

2008
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:25,760
why don't I I'm going to actually I yeah
 

2009
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,349
why don't I I'm going to actually I yeah
I want you to take a minute to try and

2010
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:27,359
I want you to take a minute to try and
 

2011
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,190
I want you to take a minute to try and
think like what could you do to solve

2012
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,200
think like what could you do to solve
 

2013
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,270
think like what could you do to solve
this problem. So take talk to someone,

2014
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:33,280
this problem. So take talk to someone,
 

2015
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,710
this problem. So take talk to someone,
ideally a different person than the

ideally a different person than the
 

2017

00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:06,960

 

2031
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,150

Well, I don't

Well, I don't
 

2033
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:25,510
Well, I don't
really

So that's why for a lot of things
 

2039

So that's why for a lot of things
you don't know that

00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240

 

2041
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,750

they're very small and

2042
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760

 

2043
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,030

That's

2044
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,040

 

2045
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,589

>> okay. That's my timer.

2046
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:29,599
>> okay. That's my timer.
 

2047
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,510
>> okay. That's my timer.
>> So, what are what Yeah. What are some

2048
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:31,520
>> So, what are what Yeah. What are some
 

2049
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,910
>> So, what are what Yeah. What are some
ideas on, you know, what do you do when

2050
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:33,920
ideas on, you know, what do you do when
 

2051
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,470
ideas on, you know, what do you do when
you have some values or some singular

2052
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:36,480
you have some values or some singular
 

2053
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,829
you have some values or some singular
values that are threatening to blow up,

2054
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:37,839
values that are threatening to blow up,
 

2055
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:42,870
values that are threatening to blow up,
others that are just not moving?

2056
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:42,880

Someone else, someone else who hasn't
been participating as much.

2060
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:46,960
been participating as much.
 

2061
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,470
been participating as much.
>> Yeah, you've been asking a lot of

2062
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:48,480
>> Yeah, you've been asking a lot of
 

2063
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,710
>> Yeah, you've been asking a lot of
questions. Yeah. You pick a different

2064
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:50,720
questions. Yeah. You pick a different
 

2065
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,630
questions. Yeah. You pick a different
learning rate for

2066
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:52,640
learning rate for
 

2067
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,150
learning rate for
>> Yeah, it would be great if you could

2068
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:54,160
>> Yeah, it would be great if you could
 

2069
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,470
>> Yeah, it would be great if you could
pick a different learning rate for every

pick a different learning rate for every
 

2071
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,349
pick a different learning rate for every
different direction, right? So, how

2072
00:48:59,349 --> 00:48:59,359
different direction, right? So, how
 

2073
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,950
different direction, right? So, how
would you pick a different learning rate

2074
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:00,960
would you pick a different learning rate
 

2075
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,190
would you pick a different learning rate
for every different direction? What's

2076
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:03,200
for every different direction? What's
 

2077
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:10,870
for every different direction? What's
one way that you could try to do that?

2078
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:10,880

 

2079
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,829

>> Yeah.

2080
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:11,839
>> Yeah.
 

2081
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,230
>> Yeah.
>> Based on how fast they've been learning.

Could you elaborate more on what you

2086
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:16,880
Could you elaborate more on what you
 

2087
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,190
Could you elaborate more on what you
mean by that? like this concept of

2088
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:19,200
mean by that? like this concept of
 

2089
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,430
mean by that? like this concept of
momentum that changing a lot perhaps you

2090
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:23,440
momentum that changing a lot perhaps you
 

2091
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,870
momentum that changing a lot perhaps you
increase the learning rate for that

2092
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:24,880
increase the learning rate for that
 

2093
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,190
increase the learning rate for that
specific weight but it doesn't blow up

2094
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:27,200

2095
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,829
specific weight but it doesn't blow up
as much. So somehow somehow you have to

2096
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:29,839
as much. So somehow somehow you have to
 

2097
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,230
as much. So somehow somehow you have to
tweak based on the based on I don't I

2098
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:32,240
tweak based on the based on I don't I
 

2099
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,670
tweak based on the based on I don't I
I'm not sure I understand the momentum

2100
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:33,680
I'm not sure I understand the momentum
 

2101
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,030
I'm not sure I understand the momentum
connection but somehow you want to tweak

2102
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:35,040
connection but somehow you want to tweak
 

2103
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,950
connection but somehow you want to tweak
based on how fast things are moving in

2104
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:36,960
based on how fast things are moving in
 

2105
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,910
based on how fast things are moving in
each direction,

2106
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:37,920
each direction,
 

2107
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,349
each direction,
>> right? So what like what dictates how

2108
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:41,359
>> right? So what like what dictates how
 

2109
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,109

2111
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,390
fast we're moving in each direction?
>> Yeah,

2112
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,400
>> Yeah,
 

2113
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,190
>> Yeah,
>> the singular values, right? So what

2114
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,200
>> the singular values, right? So what
 

2115
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,309
>> the singular values, right? So what
would you do in some ideal world?

2116
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:52,319
would you do in some ideal world?
 

2117
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,390
would you do in some ideal world?
But what like if you wanted to say I

2118
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,400
But what like if you wanted to say I
 

2119
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,230
But what like if you wanted to say I
want to move approximately the same in

2120
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:56,240
want to move approximately the same in
 

2121
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,069
want to move approximately the same in
every direction.

2122
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
every direction.
 

2123
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,589
every direction.
One thing that you could do is you could

2124
00:49:59,589 --> 00:49:59,599
One thing that you could do is you could
 

2125
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,630
One thing that you could do is you could
say well let me take the SVD

2126
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:02,640
say well let me take the SVD
 

2127
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,750
say well let me take the SVD
and then say I will appropriately say

2128
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:07,760
and then say I will appropriately say
 

2129
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,510
and then say I will appropriately say
okay I will have a different learning

2130
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:09,520
okay I will have a different learning
 

2131
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,950
okay I will have a different learning
rate in every single direction

2132
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
rate in every single direction
 

2133
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,990
rate in every single direction
and it will be based on what is the

2134
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,000
and it will be based on what is the
 

2135
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,870
and it will be based on what is the
singular value in that direction right

2136
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:18,880
singular value in that direction right
 

2137
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,710
singular value in that direction right
and I will basically normalize and

2138
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:20,720
and I will basically normalize and
 

2139
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,309
and I will basically normalize and
equalize all of my steps based on that

2140
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
equalize all of my steps based on that
 

2141
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,990
equalize all of my steps based on that
does that seem like a reasonable idea

2142
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,000
does that seem like a reasonable idea
 

2143
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,910
does that seem like a reasonable idea
right because you're basically saying

2144
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:27,920
right because you're basically saying
 

2145
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,510
right because you're basically saying
you're the problem is coming because

2146
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520
you're the problem is coming because
 

2147
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,710
you're the problem is coming because
you're coupling all of your steps

2148
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:30,720
you're coupling all of your steps
 

2149
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,349
you're coupling all of your steps
together by this one learning rate.

2150
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:33,359
together by this one learning rate.
 

2151
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,710
together by this one learning rate.
So don't don't do that. So why don't we

2152
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:36,720
So don't don't do that. So why don't we
 

2153
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,390
So don't don't do that. So why don't we
do that in practice? Why is that not

2154
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:38,400
do that in practice? Why is that not
 

2155
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,829
do that in practice? Why is that not
like the standard thing that everyone

2156
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:39,839
like the standard thing that everyone
 

2157
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,910
like the standard thing that everyone
does?

2158
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:41,920
does?
 

2159
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,309
does?
It's really expensive, right? Because if

2160
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:44,319
It's really expensive, right? Because if
 

2161
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,470
It's really expensive, right? Because if
you have these giant data matrices, if

2162
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:46,480
you have these giant data matrices, if
 

2163
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,309
you have these giant data matrices, if
your data is gets bigger and bigger and

2164
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:48,319
your data is gets bigger and bigger and
 

2165
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,390
your data is gets bigger and bigger and
bigger, computing the SVD of that thing

2166
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:52,400
bigger, computing the SVD of that thing
 

2167
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,430
bigger, computing the SVD of that thing
is a monster. So you you can't compute

2168
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
is a monster. So you you can't compute
 

2169
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,829
is a monster. So you you can't compute
the singular values

2170
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:57,839
the singular values
 

2171
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,990
the singular values
to you know do this process at all. So

2172
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:02,000
to you know do this process at all. So
 

2173
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,349
to you know do this process at all. So
it would be great if we could do that

2174
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:03,359
it would be great if we could do that
 

2175
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,190
it would be great if we could do that
but we can't. I forgot to show this

2176
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,200
but we can't. I forgot to show this
 

2177
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,670
but we can't. I forgot to show this
picture which is

2178
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:07,680
picture which is
 

2179
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,670
picture which is
uh what is happening when you have these

2180
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:09,680
uh what is happening when you have these
 

2181
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,430
uh what is happening when you have these
unbalanced singular values. Right? So

2182
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:11,440
unbalanced singular values. Right? So
 

2183
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,510
unbalanced singular values. Right? So
basically here I have um kind of this

2184
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:15,520
basically here I have um kind of this
 

2185
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,109
basically here I have um kind of this
this ellipsoid showing the singular

2186
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:17,119
this ellipsoid showing the singular
 

2187
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,069
this ellipsoid showing the singular
values and with a small step size I

2188
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:20,079
values and with a small step size I
 

2189
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,589
values and with a small step size I
converge very nicely to the optimum

2190
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:23,599
converge very nicely to the optimum
 

2191
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,510
converge very nicely to the optimum
but I make rapid progress in this

2192
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:25,520
but I make rapid progress in this
 

2193
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,549
but I make rapid progress in this
direction and then I'm just extremely

2194
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:28,559
direction and then I'm just extremely
 

2195
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:29,990
direction and then I'm just extremely
slow making progress in this direction.

2196
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:30,000
slow making progress in this direction.
 

2197
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,829
slow making progress in this direction.
Right? It takes a long time to converge

2198
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:31,839
Right? It takes a long time to converge
 

2199
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,150
Right? It takes a long time to converge
along this coordinate. Whereas if I

2200
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:34,160
along this coordinate. Whereas if I
 

2201
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,549
along this coordinate. Whereas if I
increase my learning rate

2202
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:36,559
increase my learning rate
 

2203
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,710
increase my learning rate
then I'm bouncing around and not really

2204
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:38,720
then I'm bouncing around and not really
 

2205
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,109
then I'm bouncing around and not really
converging.

2206
00:51:41,109 --> 00:51:41,119
converging.
 

2207
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:42,790
converging.
So just that picture I forgot to talk

2208
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,800
So just that picture I forgot to talk
 

2209
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,349
So just that picture I forgot to talk
about but okay.

2210
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:45,359
about but okay.
 

2211
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,910
about but okay.
So what the key idea that is motivating

2212
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:49,920
So what the key idea that is motivating
 

2213
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,910
So what the key idea that is motivating
u Adam and some of the precursors of

2214
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:51,920
u Adam and some of the precursors of
 

2215
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,349
u Adam and some of the precursors of
Adam is to say well okay the SVD is

2216
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:55,359
Adam is to say well okay the SVD is
 

2217
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,950
Adam is to say well okay the SVD is
maybe too expensive but what can we do?

2218
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:58,960
maybe too expensive but what can we do?
 

2219
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,150
maybe too expensive but what can we do?
Well can we normalize our gradients

2220
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,160
Well can we normalize our gradients
 

2221
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,670
Well can we normalize our gradients
somehow? Okay.

2222
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:05,680
somehow? Okay.
 

2223
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,549
somehow? Okay.
And it might be too expensive to compute

2224
00:52:08,549 --> 00:52:08,559
And it might be too expensive to compute
 

2225
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,069
And it might be too expensive to compute
the SVD and say I move in equally in

2226
00:52:12,069 --> 00:52:12,079
the SVD and say I move in equally in
 

2227
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,710
the SVD and say I move in equally in
every direction in the SVD. But what I

2228
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:14,720
every direction in the SVD. But what I
 

2229
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,349
every direction in the SVD. But what I
can do is I can try to do that in the

2230
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:17,359
can do is I can try to do that in the
 

2231
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:21,349
can do is I can try to do that in the
coordinate system that I am in already.

2232
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:21,359
coordinate system that I am in already.
 

2233
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,950
coordinate system that I am in already.
Okay.

2234
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:24,960

 

2235
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,710

So

2236
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:26,720
So
 

2237
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,670
So
let's see what I actually mean by that.

2238
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:29,680
let's see what I actually mean by that.
 

2239
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,390
let's see what I actually mean by that.
So let me take our gradient descent

2240
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:32,400
So let me take our gradient descent
 

2241
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,549
So let me take our gradient descent
equation. This is my normal gradient

2242
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:34,559
equation. This is my normal gradient
 

2243
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,670
equation. This is my normal gradient
descent update equation. Right?

2244
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:37,680
descent update equation. Right?
 

2245
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,150
descent update equation. Right?
And instead of taking this gradient

2246
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:42,160
And instead of taking this gradient
 

2247
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,150
And instead of taking this gradient
update,

2248
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:44,160
update,
 

2249
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,390
update,
let me compute the following. What I'm

2250
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:46,400
let me compute the following. What I'm
 

2251
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,109
let me compute the following. What I'm
going to do is I'm going to define this

2252
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:49,119
going to do is I'm going to define this
 

2253
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,670
going to do is I'm going to define this
term MT and I'm just going to call that

2254
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:51,680
term MT and I'm just going to call that
 

2255
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,030
term MT and I'm just going to call that
the gradient. Okay? And I'm going to

2256
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:55,040
the gradient. Okay? And I'm going to
 

2257
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,510
the gradient. Okay? And I'm going to
have this term VT.

2258
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:57,520
have this term VT.
 

2259
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,589
have this term VT.
and vt is just going to be the value of

2260
00:52:59,589 --> 00:52:59,599
and vt is just going to be the value of
 

2261
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,510
and vt is just going to be the value of
the squared gradient. And I'm thinking

2262
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:01,520
the squared gradient. And I'm thinking
 

2263
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,349
the squared gradient. And I'm thinking
here of an element wise square. Okay,

2264
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:03,359
here of an element wise square. Okay,
 

2265
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,990
here of an element wise square. Okay,
I'm not taking u an inner product but

2266
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm not taking u an inner product but
 

2267
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:15,270
I'm not taking u an inner product but
I'm taking an element wise square.

2268
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:15,280

 

2269
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,670

So if I take

2270
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:17,680
So if I take
 

2271
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,150
So if I take
a number and I divide it by the square

2272
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,160
a number and I divide it by the square
 

2273
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,109
a number and I divide it by the square
root of its square, what do I get back?

2274
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:23,119
root of its square, what do I get back?
 

2275
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,790
root of its square, what do I get back?
So I have a /<unk> a^ square.

2276
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:28,800

 

2277
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,950

I basically get the sign back, right?

2278
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:32,960
I basically get the sign back, right?
 

2279
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,109
I basically get the sign back, right?
The absolute the square root of the a

2280
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:35,119
The absolute the square root of the a
 

2281
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,470
The absolute the square root of the a
squ is going to give me the absolute

2282
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,480
squ is going to give me the absolute
 

2283
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,230
squ is going to give me the absolute
value of a. So I get basically like if I

2284
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:38,240
value of a. So I get basically like if I
 

2285
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,630
value of a. So I get basically like if I
have a divided by absolute value of a.

2286
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:40,640
have a divided by absolute value of a.
 

2287
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,270
have a divided by absolute value of a.
What's that? It's the s of a, right? So

2288
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:45,280
What's that? It's the s of a, right? So
 

2289
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,870
What's that? It's the s of a, right? So
when I take mt

2290
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:48,880
when I take mt
 

2291
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,950
when I take mt
divided by

2292
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:54,960

 

2293
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,430

square root of vt.

2294
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:57,440
square root of vt.
 

2295
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,430
square root of vt.
What I'm getting back is basically the

2296
00:53:59,430 --> 00:53:59,440
What I'm getting back is basically the
 

2297
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,910
What I'm getting back is basically the
sign of the gradient. Does everyone see

2298
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
sign of the gradient. Does everyone see
 

2299
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,589
sign of the gradient. Does everyone see
that?

2300
00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:03,599
that?
 

2301
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,990
that?
Yes. No.

2302
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,000
Yes. No.
 

2303
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,510
Yes. No.
Okay.

2304
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:09,520

 

2305
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,390

And so if I compute instead of looking

2306
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:12,400
And so if I compute instead of looking
 

2307
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,190
And so if I compute instead of looking
at instead of taking my gradient step

2308
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:17,200
at instead of taking my gradient step
 

2309
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,109
at instead of taking my gradient step
what if I can say look I'm going to look

2310
00:54:19,109 --> 00:54:19,119
what if I can say look I'm going to look
 

2311
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,630
what if I can say look I'm going to look
at the my gradient and I'm going to look

2312
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:20,640
at the my gradient and I'm going to look
 

2313
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,150
at the my gradient and I'm going to look
at every component of it and I'm going

2314
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:22,160
at every component of it and I'm going
 

2315
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,230
at every component of it and I'm going
to say wait are you positive or are you

2316
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:24,240
to say wait are you positive or are you
 

2317
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,270
to say wait are you positive or are you
negative are you positive or you

2318
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,280
negative are you positive or you
 

2319
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,230
negative are you positive or you
negative are you positive or you

2320
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:26,240
negative are you positive or you
 

2321
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,270
negative are you positive or you
negative just tell me generally which

2322
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:29,280
negative just tell me generally which
 

2323
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,109
negative just tell me generally which
way I should go in every coordinate

2324
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:31,119
way I should go in every coordinate
 

2325
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,390
way I should go in every coordinate
right that's what the sign of the

2326
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:32,400
right that's what the sign of the
 

2327
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,630
right that's what the sign of the
gradient is telling us

2328
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:36,640

 

2329
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,270

what this is is a quick way to get that

2330
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:39,280
what this is is a quick way to get that
 

2331
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,190
what this is is a quick way to get that
sign of the gradient out.

2332
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:43,200

 

2333
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,670

So to normalize what I can do is I can

2334
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:45,680
So to normalize what I can do is I can
 

2335
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,549
So to normalize what I can do is I can
instead take steps

2336
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:48,559
instead take steps
 

2337
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,589
instead take steps
in this direction along the sign of the

2338
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:51,599
in this direction along the sign of the
 

2339
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,309
in this direction along the sign of the
gradient and I can think of this as

2340
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:54,319
gradient and I can think of this as
 

2341
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:59,349
gradient and I can think of this as
basically sin SGD. So if I look at this

2342
00:54:59,349 --> 00:54:59,359
basically sin SGD. So if I look at this
 

2343
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,910
basically sin SGD. So if I look at this
particular equation,

2344
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:01,920
particular equation,
 

2345
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,150
particular equation,
that is what I want to call sin SGD

2346
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,160
that is what I want to call sin SGD
 

2347
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,990
that is what I want to call sin SGD
because I'm taking a step in the

2348
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,000
because I'm taking a step in the
 

2349
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,309
because I'm taking a step in the
direction of the sign of the gradient.

2350
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:08,319
direction of the sign of the gradient.
 

2351
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,390
direction of the sign of the gradient.
You notice here that I have this little

2352
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:10,400
You notice here that I have this little
 

2353
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,109
You notice here that I have this little
epsilon that I've added in the

2354
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:13,119
epsilon that I've added in the
 

2355
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,710
epsilon that I've added in the
denominator. And why is that epsilon

2356
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:14,720
denominator. And why is that epsilon
 

2357
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,950
denominator. And why is that epsilon
there? Well, because I want to make sure

2358
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:16,960
there? Well, because I want to make sure
 

2359
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,109
there? Well, because I want to make sure
that my algorithm is numerically stable

2360
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:19,119
that my algorithm is numerically stable
 

2361
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,109
that my algorithm is numerically stable
and I don't want to get my denominator

2362
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:21,119
and I don't want to get my denominator
 

2363
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,710
and I don't want to get my denominator
too close to zero and then have start

2364
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,720
too close to zero and then have start
 

2365
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,910
too close to zero and then have start
things start to blow up, right? So just

2366
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:25,920
things start to blow up, right? So just
 

2367
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,150
things start to blow up, right? So just
for practicality of implementation, I

2368
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:28,160
for practicality of implementation, I
 

2369
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,309
for practicality of implementation, I
have that epsilon there. But really what

2370
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:30,319
have that epsilon there. But really what
 

2371
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,470
have that epsilon there. But really what
I'm trying to do is I'm trying to say

2372
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:32,480
I'm trying to do is I'm trying to say
 

2373
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,390
I'm trying to do is I'm trying to say
move in all of the coordinates

2374
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:34,400
move in all of the coordinates
 

2375
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,470
move in all of the coordinates
approximately equally because you're

2376
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:36,480
approximately equally because you're
 

2377
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,549
approximately equally because you're
moving now

2378
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:38,559
moving now
 

2379
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,589
moving now
exactly ADA in every coordinate. Right?

2380
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
exactly ADA in every coordinate. Right?
 

2381
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,430
exactly ADA in every coordinate. Right?
It's not the SVD coordinates. It's in

2382
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:43,440
It's not the SVD coordinates. It's in
 

2383
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,309
It's not the SVD coordinates. It's in
the like native basis that you're in.

2384
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:46,319
the like native basis that you're in.
 

2385
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:47,990
the like native basis that you're in.
But you've somehow equalized how you're

2386
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:48,000
But you've somehow equalized how you're
 

2387
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,230
But you've somehow equalized how you're
moving. Does that make sense to

2388
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:50,240
moving. Does that make sense to
 

2389
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,150
moving. Does that make sense to
everyone? Okay.

2390
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:54,160
everyone? Okay.
 

2391
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,750
everyone? Okay.
This is a great idea, but what is the

2392
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,760
This is a great idea, but what is the
 

2393
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,030
This is a great idea, but what is the
problem with this?

2394
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:01,040
problem with this?
 

2395
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,470
problem with this?
What is a possible problem with

2396
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:02,480
What is a possible problem with
 

2397
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,270
What is a possible problem with
something like this?

2398
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280

 

2399
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,510

Right? Why do why why is there still

2400
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:09,520
Right? Why do why why is there still
 

2401
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,950
Right? Why do why why is there still
lecture to give? Why don't I say like

2402
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:10,960
lecture to give? Why don't I say like
 

2403
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,190
lecture to give? Why don't I say like
great now we do sin GD and let's go

2404
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:13,200
great now we do sin GD and let's go
 

2405
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,589
great now we do sin GD and let's go
home.

2406
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:15,599
home.
 

2407
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:16,150
home.
>> Yeah.

2408
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:16,160
>> Yeah.
 

2409
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,390
>> Yeah.
>> What's the value of

2410
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,400
>> What's the value of
 

2411
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,190
>> What's the value of
epsilon?

2412
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:19,200
epsilon?
 

2413
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,510
epsilon?
>> Oh, epsilon is just some it's like a

2414
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:21,520
>> Oh, epsilon is just some it's like a
 

2415
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,190
>> Oh, epsilon is just some it's like a
hyperparameter. something tiny just to

2416
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:23,200
hyperparameter. something tiny just to
 

2417
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,470
hyperparameter. something tiny just to
make sure you don't divide by zero.

2418
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:24,480
make sure you don't divide by zero.
 

2419
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,670
make sure you don't divide by zero.
That's that's not um that that I guess

2420
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:27,680
That's that's not um that that I guess
 

2421
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,789
That's that's not um that that I guess
that could be a problem, but that's not

2422
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:28,799
that could be a problem, but that's not
 

2423
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,549
that could be a problem, but that's not
the problem I wanted to get to. But the

2424
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:30,559
the problem I wanted to get to. But the
 

2425
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,109
the problem I wanted to get to. But the
issue is that because now I'm doing the

2426
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:33,119
issue is that because now I'm doing the
 

2427
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,870
issue is that because now I'm doing the
sign, right? Once I get close to the

2428
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880
sign, right? Once I get close to the
 

2429
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,190
sign, right? Once I get close to the
optimum, I might just keep like I might

2430
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,200
optimum, I might just keep like I might
 

2431
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,710
optimum, I might just keep like I might
overshoot and then I have a positive

2432
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720
overshoot and then I have a positive
 

2433
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,990
overshoot and then I have a positive
gradient, overshoot, I have a negative

2434
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:40,000
gradient, overshoot, I have a negative
 

2435
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,430
gradient, overshoot, I have a negative
gradient, overshoot, positive gradient,

2436
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:41,440
gradient, overshoot, positive gradient,
 

2437
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,829
gradient, overshoot, positive gradient,
ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, and I'm

2438
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:43,839
ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, and I'm
 

2439
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,910
ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, and I'm
just going to I might just keep bouncing

2440
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:45,920
just going to I might just keep bouncing
 

2441
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,430
just going to I might just keep bouncing
around right near the optimum, right?

2442
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,440
around right near the optimum, right?
 

2443
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,510
around right near the optimum, right?
And that's not good.

2444
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:51,520
And that's not good.
 

2445
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,030
And that's not good.
So I want to do something that is

2446
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:53,040
So I want to do something that is
 

2447
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,309
So I want to do something that is
basically a smoothed version of this.

2448
00:56:56,309 --> 00:56:56,319
basically a smoothed version of this.
 

2449
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,470
basically a smoothed version of this.
And what have we talked about as a way

2450
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:58,480
And what have we talked about as a way
 

2451
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,109
And what have we talked about as a way
of doing things smoothly? There's like I

2452
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:01,119
of doing things smoothly? There's like I
 

2453
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,710
of doing things smoothly? There's like I
mean it's been three lectures. There's

2454
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:02,720
mean it's been three lectures. There's
 

2455
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,150
mean it's been three lectures. There's
not that many things. The answer is

2456
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:04,160
not that many things. The answer is
 

2457
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,589
not that many things. The answer is
either the SVD or one of the two things

2458
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:07,599
either the SVD or one of the two things
 

2459
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,870
either the SVD or one of the two things
we've talked about. So what is the other

2460
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:08,880
we've talked about. So what is the other
 

2461
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:14,870
we've talked about. So what is the other
thing we've talked about?

2462
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:14,880

 

2463
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,510

>> Momentum.

2464
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:15,520
>> Momentum.
 

2465
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,630
>> Momentum.
>> Momentum. Right. So instead of taking

2466
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:18,640
>> Momentum. Right. So instead of taking
 

2467
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,470
>> Momentum. Right. So instead of taking
exactly the gradient, can I take

2468
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:20,480
exactly the gradient, can I take
 

2469
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,870
exactly the gradient, can I take
basically the averaged gradient and do

2470
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:22,880
basically the averaged gradient and do
 

2471
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,390
basically the averaged gradient and do
the same thing? And so here what Adam is

2472
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:26,400
the same thing? And so here what Adam is
 

2473
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,390
the same thing? And so here what Adam is
doing is it's saying or to get to Adam

2474
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:28,400
doing is it's saying or to get to Adam
 

2475
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,589
doing is it's saying or to get to Adam
what I want to say is look instead of MT

2476
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:31,599
what I want to say is look instead of MT
 

2477
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,750
what I want to say is look instead of MT
representing just the gradient I'm going

2478
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:33,760
representing just the gradient I'm going
 

2479
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,349
representing just the gradient I'm going
to have it represent the average

2480
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:35,359
to have it represent the average
 

2481
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,349
to have it represent the average
gradient by doing the same kind of

2482
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
gradient by doing the same kind of
 

2483
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:41,030
gradient by doing the same kind of
exponential decaying u averaging that we

2484
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,040
exponential decaying u averaging that we
 

2485
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,950
exponential decaying u averaging that we
talked about for momentum. This beta is

2486
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:42,960
talked about for momentum. This beta is
 

2487
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,349
talked about for momentum. This beta is
exactly the same. and I'll do the same

2488
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:45,359
exactly the same. and I'll do the same
 

2489
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:49,349
exactly the same. and I'll do the same
thing for the square of the gradient

2490
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:49,359
thing for the square of the gradient
 

2491
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:53,990
thing for the square of the gradient
and that gives me Adam. Okay,

2492
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:54,000
and that gives me Adam. Okay,
 

2493
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,309
and that gives me Adam. Okay,
so it's taking this idea of sin SGD but

2494
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:58,319
so it's taking this idea of sin SGD but
 

2495
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,069
so it's taking this idea of sin SGD but
saying let's do it a little bit more

2496
00:58:00,069 --> 00:58:00,079
saying let's do it a little bit more
 

2497
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:05,430
saying let's do it a little bit more
smoothly and that's what you get.

2498
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:05,440
smoothly and that's what you get.
 

2499
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,950
smoothly and that's what you get.
There's one more thing to talk about

2500
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:06,960
There's one more thing to talk about
 

2501
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,750
There's one more thing to talk about
here which is that this particular

2502
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760
here which is that this particular
 

2503
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,589
here which is that this particular
update now that you've introduced these

2504
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:11,599
update now that you've introduced these
 

2505
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,789
update now that you've introduced these
betas and these gamas

2506
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:14,799
betas and these gamas
 

2507
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:17,109
betas and these gamas
can be a bit biased and it can lead to

2508
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:17,119
can be a bit biased and it can lead to
 

2509
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,109
can be a bit biased and it can lead to
this problem of having a slow start. So

2510
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,119
this problem of having a slow start. So
 

2511
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,150
this problem of having a slow start. So
to illustrate what that means,

2512
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:24,160
to illustrate what that means,
 

2513
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,710
to illustrate what that means,
for example, if I say choose beta equal

2514
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:26,720
for example, if I say choose beta equal
 

2515
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,670
for example, if I say choose beta equal
to uh 0.9,

2516
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:29,680
to uh 0.9,
 

2517
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,270
to uh 0.9,
then what does this equation start to

2518
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:31,280
then what does this equation start to
 

2519
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,349
then what does this equation start to
look like?

2520
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:33,359
look like?
 

2521
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,910
look like?
At my very first time step, do I have a

2522
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:35,920
At my very first time step, do I have a
 

2523
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,349
At my very first time step, do I have a
momentum term? Is there a historical

2524
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:37,359
momentum term? Is there a historical
 

2525
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:41,030
momentum term? Is there a historical
gradient that I'm averaging with?

2526
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,040
gradient that I'm averaging with?
 

2527
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,589
gradient that I'm averaging with?
No. Right? So at my very first time

2528
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:43,599
No. Right? So at my very first time
 

2529
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,910
No. Right? So at my very first time
step, what is m of zero? Basically,

2530
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:45,920
step, what is m of zero? Basically,
 

2531
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,670
step, what is m of zero? Basically,
that's just zero. I just average with

2532
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:47,680
that's just zero. I just average with
 

2533
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,349
that's just zero. I just average with
zero. and m of one is well whatever the

2534
00:58:51,349 --> 00:58:51,359
zero. and m of one is well whatever the
 

2535
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:54,789
zero. and m of one is well whatever the
gradient is there

2536
00:58:54,789 --> 00:58:54,799
gradient is there
 

2537
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:58,150
gradient is there
but now my beta is 0.9 so I have 0.9 * 0

2538
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,160
but now my beta is 0.9 so I have 0.9 * 0
 

2539
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,990
but now my beta is 0.9 so I have 0.9 * 0
plus 0.1

2540
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:00,000
plus 0.1
 

2541
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,390
plus 0.1
times whatever my gradient is and so my

2542
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:02,400
times whatever my gradient is and so my
 

2543
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,950
times whatever my gradient is and so my
step at the beginning

2544
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:04,960
step at the beginning
 

2545
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,430
step at the beginning
isn't going to be on the order of

2546
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:07,440
isn't going to be on the order of
 

2547
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,789
isn't going to be on the order of
magnitude of the gradient right it's

2548
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:08,799
magnitude of the gradient right it's
 

2549
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,829
magnitude of the gradient right it's
going to be a tenth of the gradient

2550
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:11,839
going to be a tenth of the gradient
 

2551
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,630
going to be a tenth of the gradient
once I' once I have a lot of history

2552
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:14,640
once I' once I have a lot of history
 

2553
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,390
once I' once I have a lot of history
then this averaging is going to get me

2554
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:16,400
then this averaging is going to get me
 

2555
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,549
then this averaging is going to get me
to somewhere where I'm approximately

2556
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:18,559
to somewhere where I'm approximately
 

2557
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:19,910
to somewhere where I'm approximately
uh taking steps of the right order of

2558
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:19,920
uh taking steps of the right order of
 

2559
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,670
uh taking steps of the right order of
magnitude but at the beginning I could

2560
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:21,680
magnitude but at the beginning I could
 

2561
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,910
magnitude but at the beginning I could
be taking very uh small steps and that

2562
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
be taking very uh small steps and that
 

2563
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,270
be taking very uh small steps and that
could be boring because I won't converge

2564
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:27,280
could be boring because I won't converge
 

2565
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,789
could be boring because I won't converge
as fast and the whole name of the game

in this business is converging fast

in this business is converging fast
right so what Adam further does is it

2570
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:34,240
right so what Adam further does is it
 

2571
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,789
right so what Adam further does is it
does a bias correction where it says

2572
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:36,799
does a bias correction where it says
 

2573
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,190
does a bias correction where it says
look at the beginning if you're being

2574
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:39,200
look at the beginning if you're being
 

2575
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,430
look at the beginning if you're being
very very slow

2576
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:41,440
very very slow
 

2577
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,030
very very slow
correct it by this term by dividing by 1

2578
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,040
correct it by this term by dividing by 1
 

2579
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,390
correct it by this term by dividing by 1
minus beta to the t + one right As t

2580
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:48,400
minus beta to the t + one right As t
 

2581
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,230
minus beta to the t + one right As t
becomes larger and larger, beta is

2582
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:50,240
becomes larger and larger, beta is
 

2583
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,670
becomes larger and larger, beta is
between zero and one. As t becomes

2584
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:51,680
between zero and one. As t becomes
 

2585
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,109
between zero and one. As t becomes
larger, this denominator is just going

2586
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:53,119
larger, this denominator is just going
 

2587
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,430
larger, this denominator is just going
to become one.

2588
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:55,440
to become one.
 

2589
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,670
to become one.
But when you're small, this is going to

2590
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:57,680
But when you're small, this is going to
 

2591
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,710
But when you're small, this is going to
amplify your gradient just a little bit.

2592
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:00,720
amplify your gradient just a little bit.
 

2593
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,349
amplify your gradient just a little bit.
Does that make sense?

2594
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:05,359

 

2595
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:09,109

So questions about this, questions about

2596
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:09,119
So questions about this, questions about
 

2597
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,710
So questions about this, questions about
Adam.

2598

Adam.
 

2599

Adam.
We're basically trying to do something

2600
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,720
We're basically trying to do something
 

2601
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,069
We're basically trying to do something
that is saying do sin SGD with a little

2602
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:16,079
that is saying do sin SGD with a little
 

2603
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,510
that is saying do sin SGD with a little
bit of of smoothing. That's the

2604
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:17,520
bit of of smoothing. That's the
 

2605
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,069
bit of of smoothing. That's the
intuition behind great behind atom. And

2606
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:20,079
intuition behind great behind atom. And
 

2607
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,230
intuition behind great behind atom. And
we'll talk about a different intuition

2608
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
we'll talk about a different intuition
 

2609
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,990
we'll talk about a different intuition
or a related intuition more in the next

2610

power t plus one. So beta is a constant.

2646
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:10,720
power t plus one. So beta is a constant.
 

2647
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:15,349
power t plus one. So beta is a constant.
Here I'm saying that. So when uh at time

2648
01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:15,359
Here I'm saying that. So when uh at time
 

2649
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,630
Here I'm saying that. So when uh at time
t equal to zero, this is one minus beta,

2650
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:18,640
t equal to zero, this is one minus beta,
 

2651
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,430
t equal to zero, this is one minus beta,
right? So you're basically correcting

2652
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:21,440
right? So you're basically correcting
 

2653
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,549
right? So you're basically correcting
for this tiny thing here. Does that make

2654
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:24,559

gradient being too small. So you're

2668
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:41,680
gradient being too small. So you're
 

2669
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,430
gradient being too small. So you're
correcting that bias. That's really all

2670
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:43,440
correcting that bias. That's really all
 

2671
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,710
correcting that bias. That's really all
there is.

2672
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:46,720

 

2673
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,549

Other questions.

2674
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:50,559

 

2675
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,549

Okay, good. So this is Adam and this is

2676
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:54,559
Okay, good. So this is Adam and this is
 

2677
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,069
Okay, good. So this is Adam and this is
basically

2678
01:01:56,069 --> 01:01:56,079
basically
 

2679
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,109
basically
one of the most popular uh optimization

2680
01:01:59,109 --> 01:01:59,119
one of the most popular uh optimization
 

2681
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,150
one of the most popular uh optimization
algorithms that is used today.

2682
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:02,160
algorithms that is used today.
 

2683
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,990
algorithms that is used today.
Normally you will use it with SGD. Here

2684
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,000
Normally you will use it with SGD. Here
 

2685
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,630
Normally you will use it with SGD. Here
I presented it using gradient descent.

2686
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:06,640
I presented it using gradient descent.
 

2687
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,309
I presented it using gradient descent.
Normally you would compute all of these

2688
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:08,319
Normally you would compute all of these
 

2689
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:09,829
Normally you would compute all of these
with mini batches, right? So there's

2690
01:02:09,829 --> 01:02:09,839
with mini batches, right? So there's
 

2691
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,789
with mini batches, right? So there's
going to be noise in this as well.

2692
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:12,799
going to be noise in this as well.
 

2693
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,990
going to be noise in this as well.
And this normal um

2694
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,000
And this normal um
 

2695
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,390
And this normal um
so that's basically one thing to say.

2696
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:18,400
so that's basically one thing to say.
 

2697
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,510
so that's basically one thing to say.
The other thing about Adam um and

2698
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:21,520
The other thing about Adam um and
 

2699
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,710
The other thing about Adam um and
basically this idea of sin SGD is it can

2700
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:24,720
basically this idea of sin SGD is it can
 

2701
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,190
basically this idea of sin SGD is it can
help you with uh to some extent with

2702
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:27,200
help you with uh to some extent with
 

2703
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,950
help you with uh to some extent with
what is thought of as like the vanishing

2704
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:28,960
what is thought of as like the vanishing
 

2705
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,870
what is thought of as like the vanishing
gradient or the exploding gradient

2706
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:30,880
gradient or the exploding gradient
 

2707
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,030
gradient or the exploding gradient
problem. So if I have a neural network

2708
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:33,040
problem. So if I have a neural network
 

2709
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,789
problem. So if I have a neural network
and it's very very deep as I go further

2710
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:36,799
and it's very very deep as I go further
 

2711
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,190
and it's very very deep as I go further
and further in my layers I'm constantly

2712
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:39,200
and further in my layers I'm constantly
 

2713
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,950
and further in my layers I'm constantly
multiplying when I'm doing back prop

2714
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:40,960
multiplying when I'm doing back prop
 

2715
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,630
multiplying when I'm doing back prop
right and so I can have things that

2716
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:42,640
right and so I can have things that
 

2717
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,309
right and so I can have things that
start attenuating and becoming really

2718
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:44,319
start attenuating and becoming really
 

2719
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,430
start attenuating and becoming really
small or depending on the IGEN values

2720
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
small or depending on the IGEN values
 

2721
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,990
small or depending on the IGEN values
either blowing up does that does

2722
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:50,000
either blowing up does that does
 

2723
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,030
either blowing up does that does
everyone remember this from whatever 189

2724
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:53,040
everyone remember this from whatever 189
 

2725
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,230
everyone remember this from whatever 189
or whatever machine learning class

01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:56,319
they've taken

what Adam does is it says look I'm going

2730
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
what Adam does is it says look I'm going
 

2731
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,750
what Adam does is it says look I'm going
to try to normalize I'm going I'm going

2732
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:01,760
to try to normalize I'm going I'm going
 

2733
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,069
to try to normalize I'm going I'm going
to not depend too much on the magnitude

2734
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:04,079
to not depend too much on the magnitude
 

2735
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,150
to not depend too much on the magnitude
of the gradient itself. Right? I'm going

2736
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:06,160
of the gradient itself. Right? I'm going
 

2737
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,549
of the gradient itself. Right? I'm going
to I'm going to try to extract more the

2738
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:08,559
to I'm going to try to extract more the
 

2739
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,230
to I'm going to try to extract more the
direction

2740
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,240
direction
 

2741
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,430
direction
than the exact magnitudes. And so this

2742
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:13,440
than the exact magnitudes. And so this
 

2743
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,910
than the exact magnitudes. And so this
normalization basically reduces the

2744
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:15,920
normalization basically reduces the
 

2745
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,069
normalization basically reduces the
impact of a gradient that might be

2746
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:18,079
impact of a gradient that might be
 

2747
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,029
impact of a gradient that might be
becoming too small or too big.

2748
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:21,039
becoming too small or too big.
 

2749
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,109
becoming too small or too big.
So as you have deeper layers, this is

2750
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:23,119
So as you have deeper layers, this is
 

2751
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,270
So as you have deeper layers, this is
helpful for you. Does that make sense?

2752
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:25,280
helpful for you. Does that make sense?
 

2753
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,470
helpful for you. Does that make sense?
That's one of the other reasons that

2754
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,480
That's one of the other reasons that
 

2755
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,630
That's one of the other reasons that
Adam is u people like Adam.

2756
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:30,640
Adam is u people like Adam.
 

2757
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,109
Adam is u people like Adam.
So here for example this picture

2758
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:35,119

 

2759
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,349

shows the same initialization what would

2760
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:37,359
shows the same initialization what would
 

2761
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:40,549
shows the same initialization what would
happen if you took just the sign SGD.

2762
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:40,559
happen if you took just the sign SGD.
 

2763
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,549
happen if you took just the sign SGD.
So it still gets you there but at the

2764
01:03:42,549 --> 01:03:42,559
So it still gets you there but at the
 

2765
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,069
So it still gets you there but at the
end what happens is that you don't

2766
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:44,079
end what happens is that you don't
 

2767
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,270
end what happens is that you don't
actually converge and you just keep

2768
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:45,280
actually converge and you just keep
 

2769
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,190
actually converge and you just keep
bouncing between these last two points

2770
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:49,200
bouncing between these last two points
 

2771
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,470
bouncing between these last two points
whereas Adam just smooths out. It takes

2772
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:52,480
whereas Adam just smooths out. It takes
 

2773
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,230
whereas Adam just smooths out. It takes
a similar trajectory but smooths you out

2774
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:54,240
a similar trajectory but smooths you out
 

2775
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,430
a similar trajectory but smooths you out
a little bit and gets you to the actual

2776
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:57,440
a little bit and gets you to the actual
 

2777
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,750
a little bit and gets you to the actual
uh minimum. This picture is again uh

2778
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
uh minimum. This picture is again uh
 

2779
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,789
uh minimum. This picture is again uh
from the prince book.

2780
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:02,799
from the prince book.
 

2781
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:06,069
from the prince book.
Okay. So now I want to point out is that

2782
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:06,079
Okay. So now I want to point out is that
 

2783
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,910
Okay. So now I want to point out is that
you know it's great atom is great

2784
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:07,920
you know it's great atom is great
 

2785
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,670
you know it's great atom is great
momentum is great but there is a there's

2786
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:09,680
momentum is great but there is a there's
 

2787
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,349
momentum is great but there is a there's
in some sense a price that you're paying

2788
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:11,359
in some sense a price that you're paying
 

2789
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,029
in some sense a price that you're paying
right? It's not like you're completely

2790
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:13,039
right? It's not like you're completely
 

2791
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,750
right? It's not like you're completely
there's no free lunch.

2792
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:15,760
there's no free lunch.
 

2793
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,710
there's no free lunch.
So when you're doing just SGD all you

2794
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
So when you're doing just SGD all you
 

2795
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,470
So when you're doing just SGD all you
care about is the direction of the

2796
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:20,480
care about is the direction of the
 

2797
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,630
care about is the direction of the
gradient from your mini batch. And so

2798
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:22,640
gradient from your mini batch. And so
 

2799
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,910
gradient from your mini batch. And so
that's just there's just that one

2800
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:23,920
that's just there's just that one
 

2801
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,510
that's just there's just that one
equation that you're keeping track of

2802
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:25,520
equation that you're keeping track of
 

2803
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,029
equation that you're keeping track of
right.

2804
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:27,039
right.
 

2805
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,230
right.
However, now if I was doing SGD plus

2806
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:30,240
However, now if I was doing SGD plus
 

2807
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,230
However, now if I was doing SGD plus
momentum,

2808
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:32,240
momentum,
 

2809
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,390
momentum,
well, I'm keeping this one equation to

2810
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:34,400
well, I'm keeping this one equation to
 

2811
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,990
well, I'm keeping this one equation to
keep track of the running average of my

2812
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,000
keep track of the running average of my
 

2813
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,309
keep track of the running average of my
gradients and then I have another state

2814
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:38,319
gradients and then I have another state
 

2815
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,789
gradients and then I have another state
that is keeping track of where I'm

2816
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:40,799
that is keeping track of where I'm
 

2817
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,630
that is keeping track of where I'm
actually at, right? Where is where what

2818
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:42,640
actually at, right? Where is where what
 

2819
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,309
actually at, right? Where is where what
is my state of my uh gradient descent?

2820
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:46,319
is my state of my uh gradient descent?
 

2821
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:48,549
is my state of my uh gradient descent?
Everyone see this?

2822
01:04:48,549 --> 01:04:48,559
Everyone see this?
 

2823
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,630
Everyone see this?
So, basically, I've doubled the memory

2824
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:50,640
So, basically, I've doubled the memory
 

2825
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,670
So, basically, I've doubled the memory
that I now need to use to be able to

2826
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:53,680
that I now need to use to be able to
 

2827
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,430
that I now need to use to be able to
implement the algorithm.

2828
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:57,440

 

2829
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,910

And then for atom what do you see? Well,

2830
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920
And then for atom what do you see? Well,
 

2831
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,069
And then for atom what do you see? Well,
how many things do I have? I have this

2832
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:02,079
how many things do I have? I have this
 

2833
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,710
how many things do I have? I have this
momentum term. I have the squared

2834
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:04,720
momentum term. I have the squared
 

2835
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,430
momentum term. I have the squared
gradient term. And I have my actual

2836
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:07,440
gradient term. And I have my actual
 

2837
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,349
gradient term. And I have my actual
gradient distinct equation. So now I

2838
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:09,359
gradient distinct equation. So now I
 

2839
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,470
gradient distinct equation. So now I
have I've tripled the memory.

2840
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:12,480
have I've tripled the memory.
 

2841
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,109
have I've tripled the memory.
So I am paying a price in terms of the

2842
01:05:15,109 --> 01:05:15,119
So I am paying a price in terms of the
 

2843
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,710
So I am paying a price in terms of the
memory that I'm using when I'm

2844
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:18,720
memory that I'm using when I'm
 

2845
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,309
memory that I'm using when I'm
uh implementing atom.

2846
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:22,319
uh implementing atom.
 

2847
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:23,829
uh implementing atom.
Okay.

2848
01:05:23,829 --> 01:05:23,839
Okay.
 

2849
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:25,910
Okay.
One last thing. Any questions about

2850
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:25,920
One last thing. Any questions about
 

2851
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,750
One last thing. Any questions about
this?

2852
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:27,760
this?
 

2853
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,789
this?
One last thing I want to talk about is

2854
01:05:30,789 --> 01:05:30,799
One last thing I want to talk about is
 

2855
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,710
One last thing I want to talk about is
what is called atom w because this is

2856
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:32,720
what is called atom w because this is
 

2857
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,510
what is called atom w because this is
another algorithm that is very commonly

2858
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:35,520
another algorithm that is very commonly
 

2859
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,069
another algorithm that is very commonly
used uh and useful these days. Atom w is

2860
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:40,079
used uh and useful these days. Atom w is
 

2861
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,670
used uh and useful these days. Atom w is
just basically atom with weight decay.

2862
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:43,680
just basically atom with weight decay.
 

2863
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,510
just basically atom with weight decay.
So weight decay remember we talked about

2864
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:45,520
So weight decay remember we talked about
 

2865
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,150
So weight decay remember we talked about
last time if we have ridge regression

2866
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:48,160
last time if we have ridge regression
 

2867
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,670
last time if we have ridge regression
you have a gradient descent update

2868
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:51,680
you have a gradient descent update
 

2869
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,789
you have a gradient descent update
and the gradient descent equation for

2870
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:54,799
and the gradient descent equation for
 

2871
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:58,470
and the gradient descent equation for
ridge basically looks like the following

2872
01:05:58,470 --> 01:05:58,480
ridge basically looks like the following
 

2873
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,950
ridge basically looks like the following
where I have this term 1 - 2a lambda

2874
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:02,960
where I have this term 1 - 2a lambda
 

2875
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,150
where I have this term 1 - 2a lambda
that shows up on wt. Does everyone

2876
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:06,160
that shows up on wt. Does everyone
 

2877
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,150
that shows up on wt. Does everyone
remember this from the last lecture? We

2878
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:08,160
remember this from the last lecture? We
 

2879
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,309
remember this from the last lecture? We
did this.

2880
01:06:10,309 --> 01:06:10,319
did this.
 

2881
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,789
did this.
And this is basically pushing my weights

2882
01:06:12,789 --> 01:06:12,799
And this is basically pushing my weights
 

2883
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:14,309
And this is basically pushing my weights
down. It's making them go to zero.

2884
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:14,319
down. It's making them go to zero.
 

2885
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:15,910
down. It's making them go to zero.
Right?

2886
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:15,920
Right?
 

2887
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,150
Right?
What I want you to notice here is that

2888
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,160
What I want you to notice here is that
 

2889
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,150
What I want you to notice here is that
this term depends both on the

2890
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:20,160
this term depends both on the
 

2891
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,230
this term depends both on the
hyperparameter lambda and on the

2892
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:22,240
hyperparameter lambda and on the
 

2893
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,390
hyperparameter lambda and on the
learning rate ADA that you've chosen.

2894
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:24,400
learning rate ADA that you've chosen.
 

2895
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,670
learning rate ADA that you've chosen.
Okay.

2896
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:27,680

 

2897
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,309

In atom, if you wanted to implement some

2898
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:30,319
In atom, if you wanted to implement some
 

2899
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,950
In atom, if you wanted to implement some
kind of regularization or weight decay,

2900
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,960
kind of regularization or weight decay,
 

2901
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,150
kind of regularization or weight decay,
it turns out that adding a direct ridge

2902
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:36,160
it turns out that adding a direct ridge
 

2903
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,029
it turns out that adding a direct ridge
penalty is not the right way to do it.

2904
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:39,039
penalty is not the right way to do it.
 

2905
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,190
penalty is not the right way to do it.
Why is it not the right way to do it?

2906
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:41,200
Why is it not the right way to do it?
 

2907
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,829
Why is it not the right way to do it?
Because if I added a ridge penalty in

2908
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:43,839
Because if I added a ridge penalty in
 

2909
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,589
Because if I added a ridge penalty in
the gradient that is associated with

2910
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
the gradient that is associated with
 

2911
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,710
the gradient that is associated with
that ridge penalty also gets averaged

2912
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:48,720
that ridge penalty also gets averaged
 

2913
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,630
that ridge penalty also gets averaged
into all of these averaging equations

2914
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:52,640
into all of these averaging equations
 

2915
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,630
into all of these averaging equations
and it doesn't actually have the desired

2916
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:54,640
and it doesn't actually have the desired
 

2917
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,309
and it doesn't actually have the desired
effect. All these things get two coupled

2918
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:56,319
effect. All these things get two coupled
 

2919
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:57,990
effect. All these things get two coupled
together. you have the learning rate and

2920
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
together. you have the learning rate and
 

2921
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,109
together. you have the learning rate and
you have the lambda. So instead if you

2922
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:01,119
you have the lambda. So instead if you
 

2923
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,710
you have the lambda. So instead if you
wanted to regularize this what people do

2924
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:04,720
wanted to regularize this what people do
 

2925
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,270
wanted to regularize this what people do
is you just explicitly have a separate

2926
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:07,280
is you just explicitly have a separate
 

2927
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,549
is you just explicitly have a separate
weight decay. So I take the um atom

2928
01:07:10,549 --> 01:07:10,559
weight decay. So I take the um atom
 

2929
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:23,190
weight decay. So I take the um atom
equation.

2930
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:23,200

 

2931
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:31,430

And what I can do here,

2932
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:31,440

 

2933
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,430

I can explicitly add

2934
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:35,440
I can explicitly add
 

2935
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:41,190
I can explicitly add
a separate weight decay on top of this

2936
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:41,200
a separate weight decay on top of this
 

2937
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,630
a separate weight decay on top of this
that's just completely independent of

2938
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:42,640
that's just completely independent of
 

2939
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,309
that's just completely independent of
what everything is happening, everything

2940
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:44,319
what everything is happening, everything
 

2941
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,069
what everything is happening, everything
else that's happening. And this can help

2942
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:46,079
else that's happening. And this can help
 

2943
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:50,230
else that's happening. And this can help
with convergence. Okay,

2944
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:50,240

 

2945
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,750

so that's another thing that I wanted to

2946
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:51,760
so that's another thing that I wanted to
 

2947
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,670
so that's another thing that I wanted to
talk about.

2948
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:53,680
talk about.
 

2949
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,230
talk about.
So one since I have a couple of minutes

2950
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:56,240
So one since I have a couple of minutes
 

2951
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,309
So one since I have a couple of minutes
I'm I'm going to just one thing that I

2952
01:07:58,309 --> 01:07:58,319
I'm I'm going to just one thing that I
 

2953
01:07:58,319 --> 01:07:59,750
I'm I'm going to just one thing that I
found very interesting when I've been

2954
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760
found very interesting when I've been
 

2955
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,630
found very interesting when I've been
preparing this lecture is just the

2956
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:02,640
preparing this lecture is just the
 

2957
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,069
preparing this lecture is just the
history of this and how nonlinear

2958
01:08:06,069 --> 01:08:06,079
history of this and how nonlinear
 

2959
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,470
history of this and how nonlinear
progress has been in this particular

2960
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:08,480
progress has been in this particular
 

2961
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,990
progress has been in this particular
field like when you think about gradient

2962
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:10,000
field like when you think about gradient
 

2963
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,390
field like when you think about gradient
descent I read in one reference that

2964
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:12,400
descent I read in one reference that
 

2965
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,670
descent I read in one reference that
gradient descent is attributed to Kashi

2966
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:15,680
gradient descent is attributed to Kashi
 

2967
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,269
gradient descent is attributed to Kashi
which is I guess like 1800s

2968
01:08:19,269 --> 01:08:19,279
which is I guess like 1800s
 

2969
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,990
which is I guess like 1800s
uhish but I actually find it hard to

2970
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:22,000
uhish but I actually find it hard to
 

2971
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,349
uhish but I actually find it hard to
believe that gradient descent wasn't

2972
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:23,359
believe that gradient descent wasn't
 

2973
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,030
believe that gradient descent wasn't
known before that like I'm sure that

2974
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:25,040
known before that like I'm sure that
 

2975
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,789
known before that like I'm sure that
people knew about gradient descent and

2976
01:08:26,789 --> 01:08:26,799
people knew about gradient descent and
 

2977
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:29,910
people knew about gradient descent and
used gradient descent in different ways

2978
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:29,920
used gradient descent in different ways
 

2979
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,229
used gradient descent in different ways
um even before that because I like

2980
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:32,239
um even before that because I like
 

2981
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:37,030
um even before that because I like
Newton would predate that so and um so I

2982
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,040
Newton would predate that so and um so I
 

2983
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,510
Newton would predate that so and um so I
don't know but then stochastic gradient

2984
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:39,520
don't know but then stochastic gradient
 

2985
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,510
don't know but then stochastic gradient
descent the first reference is in the

2986
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:41,520
descent the first reference is in the
 

2987
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,550
descent the first reference is in the
50s like 1950s so you know think about

2988
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:44,560
50s like 1950s so you know think about
 

2989
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,550
50s like 1950s so you know think about
that

2990
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:46,560
that
 

2991
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,229
that
and then atom is actually a fun like it

2992
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:50,239
and then atom is actually a fun like it
 

2993
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,709
and then atom is actually a fun like it
it builds on uh this algorithm called

2994
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:52,719
it builds on uh this algorithm called
 

2995
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,630
it builds on uh this algorithm called
Adagrad which is basically adaptive

2996
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:54,640
Adagrad which is basically adaptive
 

2997
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,149
Adagrad which is basically adaptive
gradients

2998
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:56,159
gradients
 

2999
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:57,910
gradients
uh which is you know coming to the same

3000
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920
uh which is you know coming to the same
 

3001
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,110
uh which is you know coming to the same
problem that we were just brainstorming

3002
01:08:59,110 --> 01:08:59,120
problem that we were just brainstorming
 

3003
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,390
problem that we were just brainstorming
about is like what do you do like

3004
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:00,400
about is like what do you do like
 

3005
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,910
about is like what do you do like
everyone noticed that this is a problem

3006
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:01,920
everyone noticed that this is a problem
 

3007
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,510
everyone noticed that this is a problem
like you don't want to move too much in

3008
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:03,520
like you don't want to move too much in
 

3009
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,630
like you don't want to move too much in
one direction you want to move a little

3010
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:04,640
one direction you want to move a little
 

3011
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,709
one direction you want to move a little
bit more in the other direction so how

3012
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,719
bit more in the other direction so how
 

3013
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,110
bit more in the other direction so how
can we adapt

3014
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:09,120
can we adapt
 

3015
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,870
can we adapt
um and Adam is just adaptive and

3016
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:10,880
um and Adam is just adaptive and
 

3017
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,709
um and Adam is just adaptive and
momentum so that's that's where this

3018
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:12,719
momentum so that's that's where this
 

3019
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,590
momentum so that's that's where this
Adam comes from but that's actually

3020
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
Adam comes from but that's actually
 

3021
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,229
Adam comes from but that's actually
fairly recent like 2011 2012

3022
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:20,239
fairly recent like 2011 2012
 

3023
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:24,070
fairly recent like 2011 2012
and now what we're, you know, then AdamW

3024
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:24,080
and now what we're, you know, then AdamW
 

3025
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,430
and now what we're, you know, then AdamW
is is even is even more recent and kind

3026
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:27,440
is is even is even more recent and kind
 

3027
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,550
is is even is even more recent and kind
of as we've needed stuff to to work,

3028
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,560
of as we've needed stuff to to work,
 

3029
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,870
of as we've needed stuff to to work,
there's been this push to get these

3030
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:32,880
there's been this push to get these
 

3031
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,030
there's been this push to get these
algorithms working. And then what we're

3032
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:35,040
algorithms working. And then what we're
 

3033
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,630
algorithms working. And then what we're
going to talk about in the next lecture

01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:36,640
going to talk about in the next lecture
 

3035
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,030
going to talk about in the next lecture
and the the following two lectures we're

01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
and the the following two lectures we're
 

3037
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,709
and the the following two lectures we're
going to try to build to talking about

3038
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:40,719
going to try to build to talking about
 

3039
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,870
going to try to build to talking about
this uh optimizer that is becoming very

01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:58,000
right so very very recent but it's all
 

3049

right so very very recent but it's all
all of these things are building on

3059
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,950
things moving? Um what kind of behavior
do we want? How do we get

do we want? How do we get
 

3061
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,189
do we want? How do we get
our our intuition on how these

3062
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:15,199
our our intuition on how these
 

3063
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,870
our our intuition on how these
algorithms should behave to be kind of

01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:16,880
algorithms should behave to be kind of
 

3065
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,550
algorithms should behave to be kind of
how do we squish them into the math so

3066
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
how do we squish them into the math so
 

3067
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,149
how do we squish them into the math so
that the the things can work and going

3068
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:22,159
that the the things can work and going
 

3069
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,590
that the the things can work and going
back and circling and circling and

3070
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:23,600
back and circling and circling and
 

3071
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,030
back and circling and circling and
circling and iterating iterating on

3072
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:25,040
circling and iterating iterating on
 

3073
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,510
circling and iterating iterating on
these ideas. So I I find this history of

3074
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:27,520
these ideas. So I I find this history of
 

3075
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,189
these ideas. So I I find this history of
how these algorithms have actually

3076
01:10:29,189 --> 01:10:29,199
how these algorithms have actually
 

3077
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,110
how these algorithms have actually
evolved to be quite uh quite interesting

3078
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:31,120
evolved to be quite uh quite interesting
 

3079
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,430
evolved to be quite uh quite interesting
and something worth thinking about in

3080
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:33,440
and something worth thinking about in
 

3081
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,990
and something worth thinking about in
terms of how we get here.

3082
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:36,000
terms of how we get here.
 

3083
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,270
terms of how we get here.

>> Yeah. So, so there is a lot of debate in

3102
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:22,880
>> Yeah. So, so there is a lot of debate in
 

3103
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,149
>> Yeah. So, so there is a lot of debate in
some sense on I I guess in some sense

3104
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
some sense on I I guess in some sense
 

3105
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,030
some sense on I I guess in some sense
it's we don't know exactly why it works.

3106
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
it's we don't know exactly why it works.
 

3107
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,870
it's we don't know exactly why it works.
But

3108
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:30,880
But
 

3109
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,030
But
one thing to keep in mind in deep

3110
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,040
one thing to keep in mind in deep
 

3111
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:37,030
one thing to keep in mind in deep
learning is that the the goal of deep

3112
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:37,040
learning is that the the goal of deep
 

3113
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,709
learning is that the the goal of deep
learning is slightly different from the

3114
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:38,719
learning is slightly different from the
 

3115
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,149
learning is slightly different from the
goal of optimization. The goal of

3116
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:40,159
goal of optimization. The goal of
 

3117
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:43,350
goal of optimization. The goal of
optimization is to find the minimum.

3118
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:43,360
optimization is to find the minimum.
 

3119
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,430
optimization is to find the minimum.
The goal of deep learning is to find a

3120
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:45,440
The goal of deep learning is to find a
 

3121
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,990
The goal of deep learning is to find a
solution that generalizes

3122
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:48,000
solution that generalizes
 

3123
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,870
solution that generalizes
that may or may not be equal to the

3124
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
that may or may not be equal to the
 

3125
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,229
that may or may not be equal to the
optimum. Remember like we're our goal is

3126
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:54,239
optimum. Remember like we're our goal is
 

3127
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:56,390
optimum. Remember like we're our goal is
not to find the best fun fit to the

3128
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:56,400
not to find the best fun fit to the
 

3129
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,669
not to find the best fun fit to the
functions to the training data. Training

3130
01:11:57,669 --> 01:11:57,679
functions to the training data. Training
 

3131
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,070
functions to the training data. Training
data just happens to be what it is. You

3132
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:00,080
data just happens to be what it is. You
 

3133
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,510
data just happens to be what it is. You
know, we don't actually want to be too

3134
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:01,520
know, we don't actually want to be too
 

3135
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,229
know, we don't actually want to be too
married to that. So

3136
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:04,239
married to that. So
 

3137
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:06,149
married to that. So
in some sense the answer is it it works

3138
01:12:06,149 --> 01:12:06,159
in some sense the answer is it it works
 

3139
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:08,709
in some sense the answer is it it works
because it it works. Um it's interesting

3140
01:12:08,709 --> 01:12:08,719
because it it works. Um it's interesting
 

3141
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,669
because it it works. Um it's interesting
actually. So there's I was reading and

3142
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:11,679
actually. So there's I was reading and
 

3143
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,669
actually. So there's I was reading and
the original atom paper actually had a

3144
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:13,679
the original atom paper actually had a
 

3145
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,430
the original atom paper actually had a
bug in the like a small bug in the proof

3146
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:17,440
bug in the like a small bug in the proof
 

3147
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,750
bug in the like a small bug in the proof
but it it still works right and then it

3148
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:19,760
but it it still works right and then it
 

3149
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,030
but it it still works right and then it
was later patched and fixed and it

3150
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
was later patched and fixed and it
 

3151
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:25,110
was later patched and fixed and it
wasn't a big deal but like it it it it

3152
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:25,120
wasn't a big deal but like it it it it
 

3153
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,350
wasn't a big deal but like it it it it
still it still works and so what what

3154
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:27,360
still it still works and so what what
 

3155
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,630
still it still works and so what what
matters is that it works and I think one

3156
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:28,640
matters is that it works and I think one
 

3157
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,070
matters is that it works and I think one
of the really nice things about Atom and

3158
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:30,080
of the really nice things about Atom and
 

3159
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,189
of the really nice things about Atom and
one of the reasons it's become so

3160
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:31,199
one of the reasons it's become so
 

3161
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,870
one of the reasons it's become so
popular is that the default

3162
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:32,880
popular is that the default
 

3163
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,229
popular is that the default
hyperparameters just work

3164
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:36,239
hyperparameters just work
 

3165
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,470
hyperparameters just work
and there are I think there's been

3166
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:38,480
and there are I think there's been
 

3167
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,390
and there are I think there's been
papers ers and studies that have shown

3168
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:40,400
papers ers and studies that have shown
 

3169
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,790
papers ers and studies that have shown
that there are cases where SGD with

3170
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:42,800
that there are cases where SGD with
 

3171
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,350
that there are cases where SGD with
momentum actually beats Adam. There are

3172
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:45,360
momentum actually beats Adam. There are
 

3173
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,709
momentum actually beats Adam. There are
cases where atom beats SGD with

3174
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:48,719
cases where atom beats SGD with
 

3175
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,709
cases where atom beats SGD with
momentum. Like there's all kinds of

3176
01:12:50,709 --> 01:12:50,719
momentum. Like there's all kinds of
 

3177
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:53,110
momentum. Like there's all kinds of
basically you can craft functions where

3178
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:53,120
basically you can craft functions where
 

3179
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,950
basically you can craft functions where
atom will be amazing but SGD with

3180
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:54,960
atom will be amazing but SGD with
 

3181
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,550
atom will be amazing but SGD with
momentum will fail and and vice versa.

3182
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
momentum will fail and and vice versa.
 

3183
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,189
momentum will fail and and vice versa.
So it's not that any one of these

3184
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:01,199
So it's not that any one of these
 

3185
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,669
So it's not that any one of these
algorithms is necessarily uh perfect or

algorithms is necessarily uh perfect or

3189
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,709

does that help? Yeah,

01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:23,520
will still be there the correlated
 

3297
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,270
will still be there the correlated
directions will still be correlated and

3298
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:25,280
directions will still be correlated and
 

3299
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,709
directions will still be correlated and
uncorrelated directions will still be

3300
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:26,719
uncorrelated directions will still be
 

3301
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,390
uncorrelated directions will still be
uncorrelated so the the longer answer to

3302
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
uncorrelated so the the longer answer to
 

3303
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,790
uncorrelated so the the longer answer to
the question is although the over direct

3304
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
the question is although the over direct
 

3305
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,790
the question is although the over direct
in your face connection to the singular

3306
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:34,800
in your face connection to the singular
 

3307
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,750
in your face connection to the singular
values that is present in STD's analysis

3308
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:37,760
values that is present in STD's analysis
 

3309
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,630
values that is present in STD's analysis
that's not there. A variant of it by

3310
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:40,640
that's not there. A variant of it by
 

3311
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,550
that's not there. A variant of it by
quantization is still present. It's

3312
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
quantization is still present. It's
 

3313
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,830
quantization is still present. It's
still going to help reverse some of the

Okay, I have five minutes and I need

3324
01:15:52,709 --> 01:15:52,719
Okay, I have five minutes and I need
 

3325
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,669
Okay, I have five minutes and I need
them.

3326
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:55,679
them.
 

3327
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,910
them.
Okay. So what I want to talk about to

3328
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:57,920
Okay. So what I want to talk about to
 

3329
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:02,709
Okay. So what I want to talk about to
set up for next lecture is

3330
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:02,719

 

3331
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:05,110

how do we think what are we want to now

3332
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:05,120
how do we think what are we want to now
 

3333
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,350
how do we think what are we want to now
understand how these optimizers are

3334
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:07,360
understand how these optimizers are
 

3335
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:11,270
understand how these optimizers are
behaving on neural networks right we

3336
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:11,280
behaving on neural networks right we
 

3337
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,669
behaving on neural networks right we
want to be able to get to solutions good

3338
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:13,679
want to be able to get to solutions good
 

3339
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,070
want to be able to get to solutions good
solutions that generalize well when

3340
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
solutions that generalize well when
 

3341
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,070
solutions that generalize well when
we're working in these non-convex loss

3342
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:18,080
we're working in these non-convex loss
 

3343
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,350
we're working in these non-convex loss
landscapes that are given to us by

3344
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:19,360
landscapes that are given to us by
 

3345
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,630
landscapes that are given to us by
neural networks.

3346
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:22,640
neural networks.
 

3347
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,310
neural networks.
So the one standard approach that we

3348
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:24,320
So the one standard approach that we
 

3349
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,990
So the one standard approach that we
kind of know when to how to think about

3350
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,000
kind of know when to how to think about
 

3351
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,669
kind of know when to how to think about
this is to say like can we think about

3352
01:16:27,669 --> 01:16:27,679
this is to say like can we think about
 

3353
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:30,229
this is to say like can we think about
this in some some simpler way some

3354
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:30,239
this in some some simpler way some
 

3355
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,070
this in some some simpler way some
simplified way that kind of helps us

3356
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:32,080
simplified way that kind of helps us
 

3357
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,270
simplified way that kind of helps us
think about this and what's the standard

3358
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:35,280
think about this and what's the standard
 

3359
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:39,270
think about this and what's the standard
simple thing that we like thinking about

3360
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:39,280
simple thing that we like thinking about
 

3361
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,110
simple thing that we like thinking about
well it's linear stuff right it's always

3362
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:41,120
well it's linear stuff right it's always
 

3363
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,470
well it's linear stuff right it's always
the easiest stuff to think about and so

3364
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:44,480
the easiest stuff to think about and so
 

3365
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,110
the easiest stuff to think about and so
how can we look at these neural networks

3366
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:49,120
how can we look at these neural networks
 

3367
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,430
how can we look at these neural networks
but think of them in some way as a can

3368
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:51,440
but think of them in some way as a can
 

3369
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,189
but think of them in some way as a can
we take a linear perspective on them.

3370
01:16:53,189 --> 01:16:53,199
we take a linear perspective on them.
 

3371
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,350
we take a linear perspective on them.
They're clearly not linear, right? We're

3372
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:55,360
They're clearly not linear, right? We're
 

3373
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,310
They're clearly not linear, right? We're
not trying to make them linear. But can

3374
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:58,320
not trying to make them linear. But can
 

3375
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,910
not trying to make them linear. But can
we nonetheless try to take a linear

3376
01:16:59,910 --> 01:16:59,920
we nonetheless try to take a linear
 

3377
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,430
we nonetheless try to take a linear
perspective?

3378
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:01,440
perspective?
 

3379
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,189
perspective?
And so for this, if I think about some

3380
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:03,199
And so for this, if I think about some
 

3381
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:04,790
And so for this, if I think about some
neural network, let's say I have my

3382
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:04,800
neural network, let's say I have my
 

3383
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,990
neural network, let's say I have my
input X and I have multiple layers. I do

3384
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:08,000
input X and I have multiple layers. I do
 

3385
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,270
input X and I have multiple layers. I do
have my last layer that is my linear

3386
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:11,280
have my last layer that is my linear
 

3387
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,430
have my last layer that is my linear
layer, right?

3388
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,440
layer, right?
 

3389
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,149
layer, right?
And so one perspective that I can use to

3390
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:16,159
And so one perspective that I can use to
 

3391
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,189
And so one perspective that I can use to
take to to look at all of my of to look

3392
01:17:19,189 --> 01:17:19,199
take to to look at all of my of to look
 

3393
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,350
take to to look at all of my of to look
at my models

3394
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,360
at my models
 

3395
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:25,270
at my models
as a linear uh or as a linear model is

3396
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:25,280
as a linear uh or as a linear model is
 

3397
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,149
as a linear uh or as a linear model is
to say well can I view this by saying

3398
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:28,159
to say well can I view this by saying
 

3399
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:30,630
to say well can I view this by saying
look I take all these nonlinear layers

3400
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:30,640
look I take all these nonlinear layers
 

3401
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,310
look I take all these nonlinear layers
and I think of them as they're just

3402
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:32,320
and I think of them as they're just
 

3403
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,550
and I think of them as they're just
computing or they're just extracting

3404
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:34,560
computing or they're just extracting
 

3405
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,270
computing or they're just extracting
some features from the data. So you know

3406
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:37,280
some features from the data. So you know
 

3407
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,870
some features from the data. So you know
this transforms the data transforms the

3408
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:38,880
this transforms the data transforms the
 

3409
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,229
this transforms the data transforms the
data transforms the data transforms the

3410
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:40,239
data transforms the data transforms the
 

3411
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,470
data transforms the data transforms the
data whatever comes out here at this

3412
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:42,480
data whatever comes out here at this
 

3413
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,229
data whatever comes out here at this
penultimate layer that's just some

3414
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:46,239
penultimate layer that's just some
 

3415
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:49,350
penultimate layer that's just some
complicated nonlinear feature that has

3416
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:49,360
complicated nonlinear feature that has
 

3417
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,750
complicated nonlinear feature that has
come from the data and instead of

3418
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:51,760
come from the data and instead of
 

3419
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,830
come from the data and instead of
predetermining what those features would

3420
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:53,840
predetermining what those features would
 

3421
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,149
predetermining what those features would
be as I would do let's say I was doing

3422
01:17:56,149 --> 01:17:56,159
be as I would do let's say I was doing
 

3423
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:57,990
be as I would do let's say I was doing
polomial regression or if I was say

3424
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,000
polomial regression or if I was say
 

3425
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,350
polomial regression or if I was say
lifting the features from one feature

3426
01:17:59,350 --> 01:17:59,360
lifting the features from one feature
 

3427
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,189
lifting the features from one feature
space to another I could do that in some

3428
01:18:01,189 --> 01:18:01,199
space to another I could do that in some
 

3429
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:04,709
space to another I could do that in some
predetermined way that I have decided or

3430
01:18:04,709 --> 01:18:04,719
predetermined way that I have decided or
 

3431
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:07,830
predetermined way that I have decided or
alternatively I could Okay, let the data

3432
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:07,840
alternatively I could Okay, let the data
 

3433
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,750
alternatively I could Okay, let the data
speak for itself and let's learn some

3434
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:09,760
speak for itself and let's learn some
 

3435
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,229
speak for itself and let's learn some
features. Okay, and so I can think of

3436
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:12,239
features. Okay, and so I can think of
 

3437
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:13,990
features. Okay, and so I can think of
this as okay, I'm learning a bunch of

3438
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:14,000
this as okay, I'm learning a bunch of
 

3439
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,590
this as okay, I'm learning a bunch of
features and then at the end I'm just

3440
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:17,600
features and then at the end I'm just
 

3441
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,910
features and then at the end I'm just
going to use my uh you know I'm going to

3442
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:19,920
going to use my uh you know I'm going to
 

3443
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,070
going to use my uh you know I'm going to
have a linear model that works on these

3444
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:22,080
have a linear model that works on these
 

3445
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,030
have a linear model that works on these
features to do my classification or

3446
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:25,040
features to do my classification or
 

3447
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,510
features to do my classification or
regression or what have you problem that

3448
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:27,520
regression or what have you problem that
 

3449
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,950
regression or what have you problem that
I that I want to do. Okay.

3450
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:30,960
I that I want to do. Okay.
 

3451
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,110
I that I want to do. Okay.
And this perspective leads us to one

3452
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:33,120
And this perspective leads us to one
 

3453
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,030
And this perspective leads us to one
nice thing that is very practically

3454
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:35,040
nice thing that is very practically
 

3455
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,990
nice thing that is very practically
useful. It leads to this idea of linear

3456
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:38,000
useful. It leads to this idea of linear
 

3457
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,149
useful. It leads to this idea of linear
probing that says that look if you have

3458
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:40,159
probing that says that look if you have
 

3459
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:42,310
probing that says that look if you have
a model and you've already trained it on

3460
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:42,320
a model and you've already trained it on
 

3461
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,790
a model and you've already trained it on
something but you now want to train it

3462
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:44,800
something but you now want to train it
 

3463
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,229
something but you now want to train it
on a related task maybe on similar data

3464
01:18:48,229 --> 01:18:48,239
on a related task maybe on similar data
 

3465
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:51,189
on a related task maybe on similar data
what you can do is you can freeze all of

3466
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:51,199
what you can do is you can freeze all of
 

3467
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:53,510
what you can do is you can freeze all of
this part of the network. So you you

3468
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
this part of the network. So you you
 

3469
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,750
this part of the network. So you you
train it, you keep these weights and all

3470
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:55,760
train it, you keep these weights and all
 

3471
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,590
train it, you keep these weights and all
you do is you retrain

3472
01:18:59,590 --> 01:18:59,600
you do is you retrain
 

3473
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,630
you do is you retrain
the linear layer only, right? And that

3474
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:02,640
the linear layer only, right? And that
 

3475
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,910
the linear layer only, right? And that
can allow you to take what you've

3476
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:03,920
can allow you to take what you've
 

3477
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,870
can allow you to take what you've
learned from a set of data and fit it uh

3478
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:06,880
learned from a set of data and fit it uh
 

3479
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,790
learned from a set of data and fit it uh
to a new problem. Okay? Now, in general,

3480
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:10,800
to a new problem. Okay? Now, in general,
 

3481
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,470
to a new problem. Okay? Now, in general,
this is this is in some sense a

3482
01:19:12,470 --> 01:19:12,480
this is this is in some sense a
 

3483
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,470
this is this is in some sense a
classical perspective. Nowadays, we're

3484
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:14,480
classical perspective. Nowadays, we're
 

3485
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,830
classical perspective. Nowadays, we're
in the era of fine-tuning, which I'm

3486
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:17,840
in the era of fine-tuning, which I'm
 

3487
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,669
in the era of fine-tuning, which I'm
everyone here knows what fine-tuning is.

3488
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
everyone here knows what fine-tuning is.
 

3489
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,189
everyone here knows what fine-tuning is.
Yes. No, we're going to talk about it in

3490
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:21,199
Yes. No, we're going to talk about it in
 

3491
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:24,470
Yes. No, we're going to talk about it in
much more detail, but um just to that's

3492
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:24,480
much more detail, but um just to that's
 

3493
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,990
much more detail, but um just to that's
the idea of, you know, I'm taking a

3494
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:26,000
the idea of, you know, I'm taking a
 

3495
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,070
the idea of, you know, I'm taking a
network and I've trained it on some data

3496
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:28,080
network and I've trained it on some data
 

3497
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,630
network and I've trained it on some data
and then I'm going to fine-tune it to

3498
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:30,640
and then I'm going to fine-tune it to
 

3499
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,310
and then I'm going to fine-tune it to
fit another task and there I'm not going

3500
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:32,320
fit another task and there I'm not going
 

3501
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,430
fit another task and there I'm not going
to just, you know, focus on training one

3502
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:35,440
to just, you know, focus on training one
 

3503
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,470
to just, you know, focus on training one
layer. I'm actually going to train

3504
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:36,480
layer. I'm actually going to train
 

3505
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,350
layer. I'm actually going to train
everything. Okay.

3506
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:39,360
everything. Okay.
 

3507
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,270
everything. Okay.
But is there another perspective that I

3508
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:41,280
But is there another perspective that I
 

3509
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,470
But is there another perspective that I
can think about for linearizing? And I

3510
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:44,480
can think about for linearizing? And I
 

3511
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,750
can think about for linearizing? And I
guess I'll talk about this a little bit

3512
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:45,760
guess I'll talk about this a little bit
 

3513
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,390
guess I'll talk about this a little bit
more next time. Um

3514
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,400

 

3515
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,030

but basically I want to say that if I

3516
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,040
but basically I want to say that if I
 

3517
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,669
but basically I want to say that if I
have this network um and I'm going to

3518
01:19:55,669 --> 01:19:55,679
have this network um and I'm going to
 

3519
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,830
have this network um and I'm going to
call it f of x comma theta where x is my

3520
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:57,840
call it f of x comma theta where x is my
 

3521
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,870
call it f of x comma theta where x is my
data and theta are my parameters.

3522
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:00,880
data and theta are my parameters.
 

3523
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,110
data and theta are my parameters.
The other thing that we can you do to do

3524
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:03,120
The other thing that we can you do to do
 

3525
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,750
The other thing that we can you do to do
linearization is to or to take a linear

3526
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
linearization is to or to take a linear
 

3527
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,070
linearization is to or to take a linear
perspective is to say well let's look at

3528
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,080
perspective is to say well let's look at
 

3529
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,070
perspective is to say well let's look at
the tailor expansion right let's look at

3530
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:10,080
the tailor expansion right let's look at
 

3531
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:15,350
the tailor expansion right let's look at
the uh basically the the linearization

3532
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:15,360
the uh basically the the linearization
 

3533
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,110
the uh basically the the linearization
and what's happening as I'm as I'm

3534
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:17,120
and what's happening as I'm as I'm
 

3535
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,669
and what's happening as I'm as I'm
training my network well I have my data

3536
01:20:19,669 --> 01:20:19,679
training my network well I have my data
 

3537
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:24,149
training my network well I have my data
it is whatever it is and my parameters

3538
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:24,159
it is whatever it is and my parameters
 

3539
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,990
it is whatever it is and my parameters
my thetas

3540
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:26,000
my thetas
 

3541
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,189
my thetas
are kind of what are changing and so if

3542
01:20:29,189 --> 01:20:29,199
are kind of what are changing and so if
 

3543
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,910
are kind of what are changing and so if
I I can think of my network as it's

3544
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:31,920
I I can think of my network as it's
 

3545
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,510
I I can think of my network as it's
training as well what is happening to

3546
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:35,520
training as well what is happening to
 

3547
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,030
training as well what is happening to
this f as my parameters are changing for

3548
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:39,040
this f as my parameters are changing for
 

3549
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,709
this f as my parameters are changing for
my theta if I let's say I'm starting at

3550
01:20:40,709 --> 01:20:40,719
my theta if I let's say I'm starting at
 

3551
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:43,270
my theta if I let's say I'm starting at
some theta kn and I go to delta theta

3552
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:43,280
some theta kn and I go to delta theta
 

3553
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,870
some theta kn and I go to delta theta
well I can actually take a tailor

3554
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:44,880
well I can actually take a tailor
 

3555
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,110
well I can actually take a tailor
expansion where I now have this f ofx

3556
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:47,120
expansion where I now have this f ofx
 

3557
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,790
expansion where I now have this f ofx
comma theta kn around my uh point and

3558
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:50,800
comma theta kn around my uh point and
 

3559
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,669
comma theta kn around my uh point and
then times this first order or linear

3560
01:20:53,669 --> 01:20:53,679
then times this first order or linear
 

3561
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:56,070
then times this first order or linear
term where here I have the inner product

3562
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:56,080
term where here I have the inner product
 

3563
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:59,910
term where here I have the inner product
of the gradient with now my delta theta

3564
01:20:59,910 --> 01:20:59,920
of the gradient with now my delta theta
 

3565
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,830
of the gradient with now my delta theta
Right?

3566
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:01,840
Right?
 

3567
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,630
Right?
And this second perspective says that

3568
01:21:04,630 --> 01:21:04,640
And this second perspective says that
 

3569
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,070
And this second perspective says that
okay I can take this as a linear

3570
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:06,080
okay I can take this as a linear
 

3571
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,709
okay I can take this as a linear
approximation of our network and it

3572
01:21:08,709 --> 01:21:08,719
approximation of our network and it
 

3573
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:10,870
approximation of our network and it
points to this gradient or really its

3574
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:10,880
points to this gradient or really its
 

3575
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,510
points to this gradient or really its
transpose which is the derivative

3576
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
transpose which is the derivative
 

3577
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,510
transpose which is the derivative
and that can be thought of or the

3578
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:15,520
and that can be thought of or the
 

3579
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,110
and that can be thought of or the
entries of that can be thought of as the

3580
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:17,120
entries of that can be thought of as the
 

3581
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,350
entries of that can be thought of as the
features of the network in the training

3582
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:19,360
features of the network in the training
 

3583
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,830
features of the network in the training
that I'm going to be now doing. So I

3584
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:21,840
that I'm going to be now doing. So I
 

3585
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,669
that I'm going to be now doing. So I
will talk about this a little bit more

3586
01:21:23,669 --> 01:21:23,679
will talk about this a little bit more
 

3587
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,950
will talk about this a little bit more
next time since I'm uh I have I have one

3588
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:26,960
next time since I'm uh I have I have one
 

3589
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,830
next time since I'm uh I have I have one
minute. Okay. Um so what I want to say

3590
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:29,840
minute. Okay. Um so what I want to say
 

3591
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,070
minute. Okay. Um so what I want to say
is that this holds this holds basically

3592
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:32,080
is that this holds this holds basically
 

3593
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,390
is that this holds this holds basically
only in when do tailor expansions hold

3594
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:34,400
only in when do tailor expansions hold
 

3595
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:38,709
only in when do tailor expansions hold
tailor expansions hold when I'm not

3596
01:21:38,709 --> 01:21:38,719
tailor expansions hold when I'm not
 

3597
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:40,630
tailor expansions hold when I'm not
moving too far from where my theta kn

3598
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:40,640
moving too far from where my theta kn
 

3599
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,390
moving too far from where my theta kn
is. Right? If I'm here my gradient my

3600
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:42,400
is. Right? If I'm here my gradient my
 

3601
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,149
is. Right? If I'm here my gradient my
linear approximation holds only in the

3602
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:44,159
linear approximation holds only in the
 

3603
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:46,950
linear approximation holds only in the
small neighborhood. For that to work

3604
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:46,960
small neighborhood. For that to work
 

3605
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,790
small neighborhood. For that to work
there's what is called this lazy

3606
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:48,800
there's what is called this lazy
 

3607
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,229
there's what is called this lazy
training assumption which is saying that

3608
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:50,239
training assumption which is saying that
 

3609
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:53,030
training assumption which is saying that
your parameters are not moving too much.

3610
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:53,040
your parameters are not moving too much.
 

3611
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,910
your parameters are not moving too much.
And next time we will talk about why we

And next time we will talk about why we
 

3613
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,550
And next time we will talk about why we
care about these assumptions holding and

3614
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:58,560
care about these assumptions holding and
 

3615
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,149
care about these assumptions holding and
what are the implications of that on

3616
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:00,159
what are the implications of that on
 

3617
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:02,629
what are the implications of that on
other optimization algorithms. See you

3618
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639
other optimization algorithms. See you
 

3619
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:11,510
other optimization algorithms. See you
next class. Come to office hours.
