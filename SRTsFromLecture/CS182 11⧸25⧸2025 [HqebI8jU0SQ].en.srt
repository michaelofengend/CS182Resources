the work. Um, we assign people
relatively randomly so that some people

84
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,240
relatively randomly so that some people
 

85
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,749
relatively randomly so that some people
some of the reviews that projects are

86
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
some of the reviews that projects are
 

87
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,950
some of the reviews that projects are
going to get are going to be from people

88
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
going to get are going to be from people
 

89
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,189
going to get are going to be from people
working in the same uh stream and some

90
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
working in the same uh stream and some
 

91
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,870

uh in a different one. So just to give

94
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
uh in a different one. So just to give
 

95
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,350
uh in a different one. So just to give
you know if you're if you're not

96

you know if you're if you're not
 

97
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,350
you know if you're if you're not
directly working on this you might think

98
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
directly working on this you might think
 

99
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,870
directly working on this you might think
wait a minute this isn't clear this

100
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
wait a minute this isn't clear this
 

101
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,670
wait a minute this isn't clear this
isn't uh understood like why aren't they

102
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
isn't uh understood like why aren't they
 

103
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,990
isn't uh understood like why aren't they
looking at this intermediate thing

104
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
looking at this intermediate thing
 

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,270
looking at this intermediate thing
that's the kind of feedback that's

106
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
that's the kind of feedback that's
 

107
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,110
that's the kind of feedback that's
extremely valuable give it um the point

108
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
extremely valuable give it um the point
 

109
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,070
extremely valuable give it um the point
of this is to help everyone's projects

110
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
of this is to help everyone's projects
 

111
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,749
of this is to help everyone's projects
be better so that by the end when the

112
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
be better so that by the end when the
 

113
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,309
be better so that by the end when the
final ones are due the next round of

114
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
final ones are due the next round of
 

115
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,990
final ones are due the next round of
peer review will be more minor in terms

116
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
peer review will be more minor in terms
 

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,830
peer review will be more minor in terms
of feedback and so that everyone's final

118
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
of feedback and so that everyone's final
 

119
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,670
of feedback and so that everyone's final
projects will be actually very very

120
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
projects will be actually very very
 

121
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,550
projects will be actually very very
good. Um

122
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
good. Um
 

123
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,749
good. Um

people to do. We set today as the
deadline so that we could turn it around

128
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
deadline so that we could turn it around
 

129
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,309
deadline so that we could turn it around
and release it to everybody so you would

130

160
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
learning. We started talking about
 

161
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,670
learning. We started talking about
generative models. um we went into VAES

162
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
generative models. um we went into VAES
 

163
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,269
generative models. um we went into VAES
and then we're taking this little break

164
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
and then we're taking this little break
 

165
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,150
and then we're taking this little break
for one and a half lectures basically or

166
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
for one and a half lectures basically or
 

167
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,750
for one and a half lectures basically or
less than one and a half lectures to

168
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
less than one and a half lectures to
 

169
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,190
less than one and a half lectures to
talk about something which is extremely

170
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
talk about something which is extremely
 

171
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,829
talk about something which is extremely
important currently and likely in the

172
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
important currently and likely in the
 

173
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,110
important currently and likely in the
future which is post-training of models

174
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
future which is post-training of models
 

175
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,030
future which is post-training of models
and test time compute. This is going to

176
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
and test time compute. This is going to
 

177
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,190
and test time compute. This is going to
also be useful when we talk about

178
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
also be useful when we talk about
 

179
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,070
also be useful when we talk about
diffusion models for generation uh next

180
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
diffusion models for generation uh next
 

181
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,949
diffusion models for generation uh next
week after Thanksgiving which is the

182
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
week after Thanksgiving which is the
 

183
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,230
week after Thanksgiving which is the
last topic we're going to talk about.

184
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
last topic we're going to talk about.
 

185
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,870
last topic we're going to talk about.
So uh the idea is you have pre-trained a

186
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
So uh the idea is you have pre-trained a
 

187
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,470
So uh the idea is you have pre-trained a
model and now we're going to use the

188
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
model and now we're going to use the
 

189
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,870
model and now we're going to use the
language model context uh to talk about

190
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
language model context uh to talk about
 

191
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,590
language model context uh to talk about
this but many of these ideas are far

192
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
this but many of these ideas are far
 

193
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,110
this but many of these ideas are far
more general but we're going to talk

194
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
more general but we're going to talk
 

195
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,550
more general but we're going to talk
about in the LLM context

196
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
about in the LLM context
 

197
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,949
about in the LLM context
and now it's trained on this

198
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
and now it's trained on this
 

199
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,269
and now it's trained on this
distribution which is coming from the

200
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
distribution which is coming from the
 

201
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,030
distribution which is coming from the
pre-training data and we mentioned

202
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
pre-training data and we mentioned
 

203
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,630
pre-training data and we mentioned
before you know like there's instruction

204
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
before you know like there's instruction
 

205
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,949
before you know like there's instruction
following isn't well represented and so

206
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
following isn't well represented and so
 

207
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,949
following isn't well represented and so
people need to do to make these models

208
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
people need to do to make these models
 

209
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,150
people need to do to make these models
try to follow instructions uh is to give

210
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
try to follow instructions uh is to give
 

211
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,470
try to follow instructions uh is to give
it some more data that's kind of aimed

212
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
it some more data that's kind of aimed
 

213
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,470
it some more data that's kind of aimed
at the distribution you actually want in

214
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
at the distribution you actually want in
 

215
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,389
at the distribution you actually want in
practice which is instruction following.

216
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:06,399
practice which is instruction following.
 

217
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,990
practice which is instruction following.
So we did talked about this you do uh

218
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
So we did talked about this you do uh
 

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,750
So we did talked about this you do uh
supervised fine-tuning which is like the

220
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
supervised fine-tuning which is like the
 

221
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,750
supervised fine-tuning which is like the
pre-training loss cross entropy loss

222
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
pre-training loss cross entropy loss
 

223
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,670
pre-training loss cross entropy loss
except you do it not on the questions

224
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:15,680
except you do it not on the questions
 

225
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,190
except you do it not on the questions
and only on the answers. We talked about

226
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200
and only on the answers. We talked about
 

227
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,150
and only on the answers. We talked about
this last time. Okay. So then we talked

228
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
this last time. Okay. So then we talked
 

229
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,829
this last time. Okay. So then we talked
about last time the idea that

230
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
about last time the idea that
 

231
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,389
about last time the idea that
it was found to be useful to have models

232
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
it was found to be useful to have models
 

233
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,750
it was found to be useful to have models
think right to give longer answers

234
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
think right to give longer answers
 

235
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,110
think right to give longer answers
instead of just giving spitting out an

236
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
instead of just giving spitting out an
 

237
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,670
instead of just giving spitting out an
answer. And so the question became how

238
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
answer. And so the question became how
 

239
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,430
answer. And so the question became how
can we make models get better at solving

240
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
can we make models get better at solving
 

241
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,630
can we make models get better at solving
problems. We talked about this last time

242
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:36,640
problems. We talked about this last time
 

243
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,269
problems. We talked about this last time
just want to recap it.

244
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
just want to recap it.
 

245
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,069
just want to recap it.
And the chain of thought already

246
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
And the chain of thought already
 

247
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,670
And the chain of thought already
revealed one part of this which is that

248
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
revealed one part of this which is that
 

249
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,870
revealed one part of this which is that
we can trade off compute. we can spend

250
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
we can trade off compute. we can spend
 

251
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,949
we can trade off compute. we can spend
more computational resources to try to

252
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
more computational resources to try to
 

253
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,670
more computational resources to try to
get better answers. So this is part A of

254
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
get better answers. So this is part A of
 

255
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,910
get better answers. So this is part A of
our answer. This is generally called

256
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
our answer. This is generally called
 

257
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,030
our answer. This is generally called
test time compute. Spending compute at

258
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
test time compute. Spending compute at
 

259
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,710
test time compute. Spending compute at
actual test time when you're actually

260
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:00,720
actual test time when you're actually
 

261
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,710
actual test time when you're actually
doing it

262
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
doing it
 

263
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,350
doing it
as opposed to only training.

264
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
as opposed to only training.
 

265
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,509
as opposed to only training.
Now given that you're going to do this

266
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
Now given that you're going to do this
 

267
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,630
Now given that you're going to do this
the question became now how are we how

268
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
the question became now how are we how
 

269
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,990
the question became now how are we how
should we train it to be better at doing

270
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
should we train it to be better at doing
 

271
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,750
should we train it to be better at doing
this and what's the sort of balance

272
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:17,760
this and what's the sort of balance
 

273
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,750
this and what's the sort of balance
okay so last time we talked about this

274
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
okay so last time we talked about this
 

275
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,829
okay so last time we talked about this
as recapping it that you know for test

276
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:23,839
as recapping it that you know for test
 

277
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,790
as recapping it that you know for test
time compute the oldest approach we said

278
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
time compute the oldest approach we said
 

279
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,550
time compute the oldest approach we said
was hey

280
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560

 

281
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,910

just prompt tell the model to give

282
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
just prompt tell the model to give
 

283
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,069
just prompt tell the model to give
longer responses is be careful, think

284
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
longer responses is be careful, think
 

285
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,350
longer responses is be careful, think
step by step. And that worked. But then

286
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
step by step. And that worked. But then
 

287
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,990
step by step. And that worked. But then
there's another approach

288
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
there's another approach
 

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,829
there's another approach
which is

290
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:43,839
which is
 

291
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,949
which is
instead of doing one try, generate n

292
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
instead of doing one try, generate n
 

293
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,710
instead of doing one try, generate n
responses.

294
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
responses.
 

295
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,269
responses.
Just sample it over and over. There's

296
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
Just sample it over and over. There's
 

297
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,150
Just sample it over and over. There's
randomness, right? Remember, because

298
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
randomness, right? Remember, because
 

299
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,430
randomness, right? Remember, because
you're sampling, so you're going to get

300
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
you're sampling, so you're going to get
 

301
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,630
you're sampling, so you're going to get
different things. And now, depending on

302
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:56,640
different things. And now, depending on
 

303
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,509
different things. And now, depending on
the problem setting, you can take a

304
00:11:59,509 --> 00:11:59,519
the problem setting, you can take a
 

305
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,590
the problem setting, you can take a
majority or plurality vote. if the

306
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
majority or plurality vote. if the
 

307
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,509
majority or plurality vote. if the
answer is a clear answer that you can

308
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
answer is a clear answer that you can
 

309
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,750
answer is a clear answer that you can
have vote on. And we told you last time

310
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
have vote on. And we told you last time
 

311
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,990
have vote on. And we told you last time
about tricks that people can do to turn

312
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
about tricks that people can do to turn
 

313
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,629
about tricks that people can do to turn
problems that are not intrinsically

314
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
problems that are not intrinsically
 

315
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,550
problems that are not intrinsically
having majority plurality votes into

316
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
having majority plurality votes into
 

317
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,870
having majority plurality votes into
things that have majority plurality type

318
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
things that have majority plurality type
 

319
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,590
things that have majority plurality type
voting strategies like using another

320
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
voting strategies like using another
 

321
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,910
voting strategies like using another
language model to judge the response and

322
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
language model to judge the response and
 

323
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,949
language model to judge the response and
then take the majority of those

324
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:22,959
then take the majority of those
 

325
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,710
then take the majority of those
judgings. Um,

326
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
judgings. Um,
 

327
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,430
judgings. Um,
but you could also just say I'll take

328
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
but you could also just say I'll take
 

329
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,470
but you could also just say I'll take
the highest probability.

330
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
the highest probability.
 

331
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,190
the highest probability.
Okay. And that's what I want to spend

332
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
Okay. And that's what I want to spend
 

333
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,990
Okay. And that's what I want to spend
more time on uh today

334
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
more time on uh today
 

335
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,430
more time on uh today
because I went through it pretty fast

336
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,440
because I went through it pretty fast
 

337
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,910
because I went through it pretty fast
last time. Now, there's also another

338
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920
last time. Now, there's also another
 

339
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,069
last time. Now, there's also another
choice you can do. Um, so remember I

340
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
choice you can do. Um, so remember I
 

341
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,710
choice you can do. Um, so remember I
talked about having an LLM read the

342
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
talked about having an LLM read the
 

343
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,069
talked about having an LLM read the
responses. You could also train. So, let

344
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,079
responses. You could also train. So, let
 

345
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:59,430
responses. You could also train. So, let
me write that down here explicitly.

346
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440

 

347
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:08,949

train a reward model

348
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959

 

349
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,030

to grade.

350
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
to grade.
 

351
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,310
to grade.
Okay, so this is like a you can think of

352
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
Okay, so this is like a you can think of
 

353
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:19,030
Okay, so this is like a you can think of
this as a variant.

354
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040

 

355
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,350

So the idea here is you you could prompt

356
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
So the idea here is you you could prompt
 

357
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,910
So the idea here is you you could prompt
you could also fine-tune or otherwise

358
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:25,920
you could also fine-tune or otherwise
 

359
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,110
you could also fine-tune or otherwise
train some model that basically takes a

360
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
train some model that basically takes a
 

361
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,550
train some model that basically takes a
response and assigns a score and says

362
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
response and assigns a score and says
 

363
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,190
response and assigns a score and says
this is a good response and this is a

364
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
this is a good response and this is a
 

365
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,310
this is a good response and this is a
bad response. Then if you have such a

366
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:38,320
bad response. Then if you have such a
 

367
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,350
bad response. Then if you have such a
thing that actually scores something

368
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
thing that actually scores something
 

369
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,829
thing that actually scores something
then the natural thing is not to take

370
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
then the natural thing is not to take
 

371
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,470
then the natural thing is not to take
the majority or plurality to say well I

372
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
the majority or plurality to say well I
 

373
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,629
the majority or plurality to say well I
did a thousand responses and most of

374
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
did a thousand responses and most of
 

375
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,829
did a thousand responses and most of
them scored you know.5 I'll just return

376
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
them scored you know.5 I'll just return
 

377
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,629
them scored you know.5 I'll just return
you a representative.5 scoring one

378
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
you a representative.5 scoring one
 

379
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,910
you a representative.5 scoring one
you're like no what's the highest

380
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
you're like no what's the highest
 

381
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,949
you're like no what's the highest
scoring one right and you can return the

382
00:13:58,949 --> 00:13:58,959
scoring one right and you can return the
 

383
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,949
scoring one right and you can return the
highest scoring one everyone with me so

384
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:02,959
highest scoring one everyone with me so
 

385
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,110
highest scoring one everyone with me so
you can think about these two choices is

386
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
you can think about these two choices is
 

387
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,829
you can think about these two choices is
as kind of interesting variations.

388
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
as kind of interesting variations.
 

389
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,230
as kind of interesting variations.
This is I train a reward model and then

390
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
This is I train a reward model and then
 

391
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,550
This is I train a reward model and then
I gives me a score and I return the

392
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
I gives me a score and I return the
 

393
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,710
I gives me a score and I return the
highest score. And the other is I just

394
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
highest score. And the other is I just
 

395
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,629
highest score. And the other is I just
think of the model itself as having a

396
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
think of the model itself as having a
 

397
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,750
think of the model itself as having a
probability and I think of the

398
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
probability and I think of the
 

399
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,470
probability and I think of the
probability as being a default reward

400
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
probability as being a default reward
 

401
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,150
probability as being a default reward
where I think that higher probability

402
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
where I think that higher probability
 

403
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,269
where I think that higher probability
things are probably better. Okay.

404
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
things are probably better. Okay.
 

405
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,189
things are probably better. Okay.
So these are uh approaches that uh one

406
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
So these are uh approaches that uh one
 

407
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,990
So these are uh approaches that uh one
can do. they are

408
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
can do. they are
 

409
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,470
can do. they are
incredibly important. And so before I

410
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
incredibly important. And so before I
 

411
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,949
incredibly important. And so before I
sort of continue, I want to mention that

412
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
sort of continue, I want to mention that
 

413
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,790
sort of continue, I want to mention that
uh

414
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
uh
 

415
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,590
uh
this kind of thing of generating end

416
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
this kind of thing of generating end
 

417
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,389
this kind of thing of generating end
responses is your you think of it as

418
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
responses is your you think of it as
 

419
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,590
responses is your you think of it as
your default way of spending test time

420
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
your default way of spending test time
 

421
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,590
your default way of spending test time
compute.

422
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
compute.
 

423
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,829
compute.
Okay? And everything you do should be,

424
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
Okay? And everything you do should be,
 

425
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,829
Okay? And everything you do should be,
you know, better than that.

426
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
you know, better than that.
 

427
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,670
you know, better than that.
Right? Kind of a way of thinking about

428
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
Right? Kind of a way of thinking about
 

429
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,710
Right? Kind of a way of thinking about
it because you you can do this. Okay. Um

430
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
it because you you can do this. Okay. Um
 

431
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,870
it because you you can do this. Okay. Um
okay. So now uh another approach that uh

432
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:16,880
okay. So now uh another approach that uh
 

433
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,550
okay. So now uh another approach that uh
you can take is to say let me find a

434
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
you can take is to say let me find a
 

435
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,870
you can take is to say let me find a
different way of sampling

436
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
different way of sampling
 

437
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,269
different way of sampling
that is going to give me just better

438
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
that is going to give me just better
 

439
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,069
that is going to give me just better
responses by the way I sample

440
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
responses by the way I sample
 

441
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,310
responses by the way I sample
themselves.

442
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
themselves.
 

443
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,509
themselves.
So there was a paper I mentioned before

444
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
So there was a paper I mentioned before
 

445
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,430
So there was a paper I mentioned before
that I want to talk about which is very

446
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
that I want to talk about which is very
 

447
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,509
that I want to talk about which is very
recent and it's useful from a teaching

448
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
recent and it's useful from a teaching
 

449
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,269
recent and it's useful from a teaching
point of view for multiple reasons. So

450
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
point of view for multiple reasons. So
 

451
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,829
point of view for multiple reasons. So
that's why I'm picking it not because of

452
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
that's why I'm picking it not because of
 

453
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,389
that's why I'm picking it not because of
its recency. Um that says uh titled

454
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
its recency. Um that says uh titled
 

455
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,629
its recency. Um that says uh titled
reasoning with sampling your base model

456
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639
reasoning with sampling your base model
 

457
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,350
reasoning with sampling your base model
is smarter than you think. Okay. And so

458
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
is smarter than you think. Okay. And so
 

459
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,710
is smarter than you think. Okay. And so
this was motivated by the idea that

460
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720
this was motivated by the idea that
 

461
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,269
this was motivated by the idea that
people observed which was they had other

462
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
people observed which was they had other
 

463
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,350
people observed which was they had other
ways which I'll talk about of

464
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
ways which I'll talk about of
 

465
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,949
ways which I'll talk about of
fine-tuning a model to be better at

466
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
fine-tuning a model to be better at
 

467
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,670
fine-tuning a model to be better at
reasoning. And people had observed that

468
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
reasoning. And people had observed that
 

469
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,829
reasoning. And people had observed that
when you take a model and you fine-tune

470
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:07,839
when you take a model and you fine-tune
 

471
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,710
when you take a model and you fine-tune
it to be better at reasoning and you ask

472
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
it to be better at reasoning and you ask
 

473
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,790
it to be better at reasoning and you ask
what are the probabilities

474
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
what are the probabilities
 

475
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,189
what are the probabilities
of the sequences that it generates under

476
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
of the sequences that it generates under
 

477
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,590
of the sequences that it generates under
the model before it was fine-tuned. Does

478
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
the model before it was fine-tuned. Does
 

479
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,550
the model before it was fine-tuned. Does
everyone understand what we're talking

480
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
everyone understand what we're talking
 

481
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,310
everyone understand what we're talking
about here? So the model before it's

482
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
about here? So the model before it's
 

483
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,310
about here? So the model before it's
fine-tuned generates response with some

484
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
fine-tuned generates response with some
 

485
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,069
fine-tuned generates response with some
probability. It can also be used to

486
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
probability. It can also be used to
 

487
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,389
probability. It can also be used to
score responses to say what's their

488
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
score responses to say what's their
 

489
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,749
score responses to say what's their
probability, right? You simply feed it

490
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:27,759
probability, right? You simply feed it
 

491
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,590
probability, right? You simply feed it
in, look at the probabilities that come

492
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
in, look at the probabilities that come
 

493
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,110
in, look at the probabilities that come
out and multiply them together. Okay?

494
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,120
out and multiply them together. Okay?
 

495
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,230
out and multiply them together. Okay?
And what they found was that

496
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
And what they found was that
 

497
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,829
And what they found was that
somehow the process of training a model

498
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
somehow the process of training a model
 

499
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,629
somehow the process of training a model
to be better at reasoning

500
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
to be better at reasoning
 

501
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,189
to be better at reasoning
was also curiously returning sequences

502
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
was also curiously returning sequences
 

503
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,150
was also curiously returning sequences
that were more likely under the original

504
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
that were more likely under the original
 

505
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,150
that were more likely under the original
model.

506
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
model.
 

507
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,110
model.
Okay, this is an empirical observation.

508
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120
Okay, this is an empirical observation.
 

509
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,430
Okay, this is an empirical observation.
Uh

510
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
Uh
 

511
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,710
Uh
and so this paper basically takes the

512
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
and so this paper basically takes the
 

513
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,230
and so this paper basically takes the
perspective of saying okay can we just

514
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,240
perspective of saying okay can we just
 

515
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,390
perspective of saying okay can we just
turn that around and say that one of the

516
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
turn that around and say that one of the
 

517
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,549
turn that around and say that one of the
things that reasoning fine-tuning does

518
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
things that reasoning fine-tuning does
 

519
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,710
things that reasoning fine-tuning does
is it makes things more likely so let me

520
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
is it makes things more likely so let me
 

521
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,829
is it makes things more likely so let me
just be more likely.

522
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
just be more likely.
 

523
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,990
just be more likely.
Okay, that's the that's the idea here.

524
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000

 

525
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,990

So this is an intuition I gave last

526
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,000
So this is an intuition I gave last
 

527
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,029
So this is an intuition I gave last
time. I don't know if everyone got it

528
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:25,039
time. I don't know if everyone got it
 

529
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,069
time. I don't know if everyone got it
because we're going really fast at the

530
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
because we're going really fast at the
 

531
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,669
because we're going really fast at the
end which was

532
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
end which was
 

533
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,110
end which was
what's the kind of heristic way of

534
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
what's the kind of heristic way of
 

535
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,830
what's the kind of heristic way of
thinking of why more likely might be

536
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
thinking of why more likely might be
 

537
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,150
thinking of why more likely might be
better is that if you're you've

538
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
better is that if you're you've
 

539
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,669
better is that if you're you've
experienced this as a human you're

540
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
experienced this as a human you're
 

541
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,990
experienced this as a human you're
talking or arguing with somebody and you

542
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
talking or arguing with somebody and you
 

543
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,830
talking or arguing with somebody and you
say some stuff and now you've talked

544
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:43,840
say some stuff and now you've talked
 

545
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,150
say some stuff and now you've talked
yourself into a corner

546
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
yourself into a corner
 

547
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,029
yourself into a corner
right and now you're like okay I can't

548
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
right and now you're like okay I can't
 

549
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,110
right and now you're like okay I can't
like there's no good way to proceed I've

550
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
like there's no good way to proceed I've
 

551
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,070
like there's no good way to proceed I've
kind of made some errors and Now I'm

552
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,080
kind of made some errors and Now I'm
 

553
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,150
kind of made some errors and Now I'm
just sort of stuck. And so you kind of

554
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
just sort of stuck. And so you kind of
 

555
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,510
just sort of stuck. And so you kind of
babble on, right? So what's the LM

556
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
babble on, right? So what's the LM
 

557
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,310
babble on, right? So what's the LM
counterpart of that? That babbling on is

558
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
counterpart of that? That babbling on is
 

559
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,870
counterpart of that? That babbling on is
a bunch of tokens that are all like low

560
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
a bunch of tokens that are all like low
 

561
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,950
a bunch of tokens that are all like low
probability and you have to pick one of

562
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
probability and you have to pick one of
 

563
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,710
probability and you have to pick one of
them.

564
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:08,720
them.
 

565
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,230
them.
What will that do? That'll make the

566
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,240
What will that do? That'll make the
 

567
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,190
What will that do? That'll make the
entire sequence lower probability. So

568
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
entire sequence lower probability. So
 

569
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,190
entire sequence lower probability. So
it's like an intuition as to why it

570
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
it's like an intuition as to why it
 

571
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,110
it's like an intuition as to why it
might be that probability is kind of a

572
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,120
might be that probability is kind of a
 

573
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,870
might be that probability is kind of a
way of telling that something's right or

574
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:20,880
way of telling that something's right or
 

575
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,710
way of telling that something's right or
wrong. It's not. So we only hear her

576
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
wrong. It's not. So we only hear her
 

577
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,750
wrong. It's not. So we only hear her
stick and intuition. Yeah.

578
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760

 

579
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,870

>> Excellent. That's the next thing I want

580
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880
>> Excellent. That's the next thing I want
 

581
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,990
>> Excellent. That's the next thing I want
to talk about. Okay. So

582
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
to talk about. Okay. So
 

583
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,150
to talk about. Okay. So
one thing I'll talk about this turning

584
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,160
one thing I'll talk about this turning
 

585
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,990
one thing I'll talk about this turning
down temperature in a in a exactly a

586
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
down temperature in a in a exactly a
 

587
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,909
down temperature in a in a exactly a
moment. It's related turning down the

588
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
moment. It's related turning down the
 

589
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,350
moment. It's related turning down the
temperature but it's not the same. Okay.

590
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
temperature but it's not the same. Okay.
 

591
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,390
temperature but it's not the same. Okay.
So the quick answer to that um since you

592
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,400
So the quick answer to that um since you
 

593
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,230
So the quick answer to that um since you
asked the question is that when I turn

594
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
asked the question is that when I turn
 

595
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,950
asked the question is that when I turn
down the temperature, I'm still moving

596
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
down the temperature, I'm still moving
 

597
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,710
down the temperature, I'm still moving
forward one token at a time.

598
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
forward one token at a time.
 

599
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,350
forward one token at a time.
Whereas fundamental to this intuition is

600
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
Whereas fundamental to this intuition is
 

601
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,630
Whereas fundamental to this intuition is
that you're moving along and then you

602
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
that you're moving along and then you
 

603
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,350
that you're moving along and then you
find yourself in a bad place

604
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
find yourself in a bad place
 

605
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,710
find yourself in a bad place
and that's what makes the entire

606
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:04,720
and that's what makes the entire
 

607
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,590
and that's what makes the entire
sequence have low probability. Um so

608
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
sequence have low probability. Um so
 

609
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,510
sequence have low probability. Um so
there's a intuitive difference. We'll

610
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:09,520
there's a intuitive difference. We'll
 

611
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,630
there's a intuitive difference. We'll
make that a little bit more. We'll see

612
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
make that a little bit more. We'll see
 

613
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,990
make that a little bit more. We'll see
it mathematically in a moment.

614
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,000
it mathematically in a moment.
 

615
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,390
it mathematically in a moment.
So we um what are the approaches that

616
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
So we um what are the approaches that
 

617
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,990
So we um what are the approaches that
people have to doing this? Uh one thing

618
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
people have to doing this? Uh one thing
 

619
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,950
people have to doing this? Uh one thing
of course is

620
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
of course is
 

621
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,710
of course is
this approach.

622
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720

 

623
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,870

Generate n samples take the one that has

624
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
Generate n samples take the one that has
 

625
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,150
Generate n samples take the one that has
the highest probability. That's going to

626
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
the highest probability. That's going to
 

627
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,549
the highest probability. That's going to
give you higher probability samples. Did

628
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
give you higher probability samples. Did
 

629
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,029
give you higher probability samples. Did
everyone see that? Right. It's like if

630
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
everyone see that? Right. It's like if
 

631
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,590
everyone see that? Right. It's like if
you think of tossing a coin and you

632
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
you think of tossing a coin and you
 

633
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,830
you think of tossing a coin and you
would like to make the coin tosses, you

634
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
would like to make the coin tosses, you
 

635
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,510
would like to make the coin tosses, you
get to choose which coin you would

636
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
get to choose which coin you would
 

637
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,430
get to choose which coin you would
respond to and you'd like to make heads

638
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
respond to and you'd like to make heads
 

639
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,270
respond to and you'd like to make heads
more likely. You can just toss the coin

640
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
more likely. You can just toss the coin
 

641
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,430
more likely. You can just toss the coin
10 times and if you get a head, say

642
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
10 times and if you get a head, say
 

643
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,830
10 times and if you get a head, say
heads. If you don't say tails, what's

644
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
heads. If you don't say tails, what's
 

645
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,430
heads. If you don't say tails, what's
the probability of heads in this case?

646
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
the probability of heads in this case?
 

647
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,750
the probability of heads in this case?
It's much higher. Right? So this is like

648
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
It's much higher. Right? So this is like
 

649
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,710
It's much higher. Right? So this is like
the intuition. So this is one approach.

650
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
the intuition. So this is one approach.
 

651
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,590
the intuition. So this is one approach.
Another approach is

652
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
Another approach is
 

653
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,549
Another approach is
uh beam search where you generate things

654
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
uh beam search where you generate things
 

655
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,909
uh beam search where you generate things
one at a time. You keep a stack of sub

656
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
one at a time. You keep a stack of sub
 

657
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,430
one at a time. You keep a stack of sub
subsequences you're going to extend that

658
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:11,440
subsequences you're going to extend that
 

659
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,310
subsequences you're going to extend that
are the highest probability

660
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
are the highest probability
 

661
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,390
are the highest probability
subsequences. You try extending each of

662
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:14,400
subsequences. You try extending each of
 

663
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,110
subsequences. You try extending each of
them and you keep the highest to keep

664
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
them and you keep the highest to keep
 

665
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,789
them and you keep the highest to keep
whatever the highest scoring sequences

666
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
whatever the highest scoring sequences
 

667
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,549
whatever the highest scoring sequences
are. Okay, that's another approach of

668
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
are. Okay, that's another approach of
 

669
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,830
are. Okay, that's another approach of
sort of generating higher probability

670
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
sort of generating higher probability
 

671
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,430
sort of generating higher probability
sequences

672
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
sequences
 

673
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,310
sequences
um which is related to vurby decoding um

674
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
um which is related to vurby decoding um
 

675
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,230
um which is related to vurby decoding um
and uh in communications.

676
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
and uh in communications.
 

677
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,510
and uh in communications.
Now there's another approach and the

678
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
Now there's another approach and the
 

679
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,710
Now there's another approach and the
other approach is instead of sampling

680
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
other approach is instead of sampling
 

681
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,310
other approach is instead of sampling
from

682
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
from
 

683
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,470
from
the probability on sequences

684
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
the probability on sequences
 

685
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,710
the probability on sequences
I sample from the probability on

686
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
I sample from the probability on
 

687
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,470
I sample from the probability on
sequences raised to a power that's

688
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
sequences raised to a power that's
 

689
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,310
sequences raised to a power that's
greater than one. So remember we said

690
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,320
greater than one. So remember we said
 

691
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,149
greater than one. So remember we said
about probabilities. Probabilities are

692
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
about probabilities. Probabilities are
 

693
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,149
about probabilities. Probabilities are
numbers less than one. So if you raise

694
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
numbers less than one. So if you raise
 

695
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,950
numbers less than one. So if you raise
them to a power, smaller numbers will go

696
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
them to a power, smaller numbers will go
 

697
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,070
them to a power, smaller numbers will go
away faster than bigger numbers will.

698
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
away faster than bigger numbers will.
 

699
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,669
away faster than bigger numbers will.
And so if you just take the probability

700
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
And so if you just take the probability
 

701
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,070
And so if you just take the probability
and raise it to a power, it will not be

702
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
and raise it to a power, it will not be
 

703
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,390
and raise it to a power, it will not be
a probability anymore.

704
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,400
a probability anymore.
 

705
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,230
a probability anymore.
Okay? But you can normalize it. And if

706
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
Okay? But you can normalize it. And if
 

707
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,909
Okay? But you can normalize it. And if
you can sample from the normalized thing

708
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:09,919
you can sample from the normalized thing
 

709
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,909
you can sample from the normalized thing
that you get from raising it to a power,

710
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:11,919
that you get from raising it to a power,
 

711
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,390
that you get from raising it to a power,
that would give you something which puts

712
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
that would give you something which puts
 

713
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,549
that would give you something which puts
more probability mass onto higher

714
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
more probability mass onto higher
 

715
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,710
more probability mass onto higher
probability and less probability mass on

716
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
probability and less probability mass on
 

717
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,110
probability and less probability mass on
low probability.

718
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
low probability.
 

719
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,590
low probability.
Do you see that?

720
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600
Do you see that?
 

721
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,230
Do you see that?
where I mean more probability under P

722
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240
where I mean more probability under P
 

723
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,310
where I mean more probability under P
and less probability under P.

724
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:30,320
and less probability under P.
 

725
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,549
and less probability under P.
Okay. So now we can talk mathematically

726
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
Okay. So now we can talk mathematically
 

727
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,710
Okay. So now we can talk mathematically
about this uh issue which is is this

728
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
about this uh issue which is is this
 

729
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,950
about this uh issue which is is this
just low uh temperature sampling. Before

730
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
just low uh temperature sampling. Before
 

731
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,230
just low uh temperature sampling. Before
I do that, any questions that we're

732
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
I do that, any questions that we're
 

733
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,950
I do that, any questions that we're
trying to do here?

734
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
trying to do here?
 

735
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,510
trying to do here?
>> Yeah.

736
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
>> Yeah.
 

737
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,510
>> Yeah.
>> Why would you sample the different

738
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:43,520
>> Why would you sample the different
 

739
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,510
>> Why would you sample the different
sequences rather than just choosing the

740
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
sequences rather than just choosing the
 

741
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,390
sequences rather than just choosing the
highest probability?

742
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:48,400
highest probability?
 

743
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,789
highest probability?
>> You can do that too. Remember I said you

744
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
>> You can do that too. Remember I said you
 

745
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,549
>> You can do that too. Remember I said you
have to compare, right? Intuitively, you

746
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559
have to compare, right? Intuitively, you
 

747
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,549
have to compare, right? Intuitively, you
want to compare to you choosing the

748
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:54,559
want to compare to you choosing the
 

749
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,149
want to compare to you choosing the
highest probability sequence. Now, the

750
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:56,159
highest probability sequence. Now, the
 

751
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,590
highest probability sequence. Now, the
answer could be that the highest

752
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
answer could be that the highest
 

753
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,909
answer could be that the highest
probability sequence isn't actually the

754
00:21:59,909 --> 00:21:59,919
probability sequence isn't actually the
 

755
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,990
probability sequence isn't actually the
best one,

756
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,000
best one,
 

757
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,830
best one,
right? But among the high probability

758
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
right? But among the high probability
 

759
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,950
right? But among the high probability
sequences, there's a good answer.

760
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
sequences, there's a good answer.
 

761
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,029
sequences, there's a good answer.
So, you might want to sample from among

762
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
So, you might want to sample from among
 

763
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,710
So, you might want to sample from among
the higher probability sequences, not

764
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
the higher probability sequences, not
 

765
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,990
the higher probability sequences, not
necessarily the highest probability one.

766
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
necessarily the highest probability one.
 

767
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,710
necessarily the highest probability one.
That's kind of an intuition for it.

768
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
That's kind of an intuition for it.
 

769
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,470
That's kind of an intuition for it.
But you're absolutely right. That should

770
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
But you're absolutely right. That should
 

771
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,070
But you're absolutely right. That should
always be in your mind.

772
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080
always be in your mind.
 

773
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,390
always be in your mind.
Okay. Okay.

774
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400

 

775
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,669

Yeah. So, let me explain what that

776
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
Yeah. So, let me explain what that
 

777
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,270
Yeah. So, let me explain what that
means.

778
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
means.
 

779
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,750
means.
>> That's a sequence.

780
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:31,760
>> That's a sequence.
 

781
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:40,149
>> That's a sequence.
Okay.

782
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159

 

783
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,909

Okay. So, that's like an entire

784
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:41,919
Okay. So, that's like an entire
 

785
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,830
Okay. So, that's like an entire
response.

786
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
response.
 

787
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,190
response.
It's not one token. It's the whole long

788
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,200
It's not one token. It's the whole long
 

789
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,230
It's not one token. It's the whole long
line of it.

790
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
line of it.
 

791
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,070
line of it.
Okay,

792
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
Okay,
 

793
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,190
Okay,
so now natural question is is this just

794
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
so now natural question is is this just
 

795
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,950
so now natural question is is this just
low temperature sampling? And the answer

796
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
low temperature sampling? And the answer
 

797
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,630
low temperature sampling? And the answer
is no. So why is it not? So let's just

798
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:00,640
is no. So why is it not? So let's just
 

799
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,549
is no. So why is it not? So let's just
think about what you want. Let's write

800
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
think about what you want. Let's write
 

801
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,110
think about what you want. Let's write
it out.

802
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
it out.
 

803
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,630
it out.
Let's consider some position t, right?

804
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
Let's consider some position t, right?
 

805
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,350
Let's consider some position t, right?
What do we want for some position t? I

806
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,360
What do we want for some position t? I
 

807
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,230
What do we want for some position t? I
want the probability

808
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,240
want the probability
 

809
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,470
want the probability
conditioned on the past. Okay, think

810
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
conditioned on the past. Okay, think
 

811
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,909
conditioned on the past. Okay, think
about this.

812
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:17,919
about this.
 

813
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,029
about this.
So what is that? This is the probability

814
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
So what is that? This is the probability
 

815
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,430
So what is that? This is the probability
of the entire sequence.

816
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
of the entire sequence.
 

817
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,230
of the entire sequence.
Okay.

818
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240
Okay.
 

819
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,470
Okay.
And what I want to do is to raise it to

820
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
And what I want to do is to raise it to
 

821
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,390
And what I want to do is to raise it to
a power alpha is the thing I want to I

822
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,400
a power alpha is the thing I want to I
 

823
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,190
a power alpha is the thing I want to I
want to sample from.

824
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
want to sample from.
 

825
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,070
want to sample from.
Okay. So what I want to do here is I I

826
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
Okay. So what I want to do here is I I
 

827
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,830
Okay. So what I want to do here is I I
want to sample from this thing and I

828
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:43,840
want to sample from this thing and I
 

829
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,149
want to sample from this thing and I
have to normalize it right over

830
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:46,159
have to normalize it right over
 

831
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,590
have to normalize it right over
everything that could have gone in this

832
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
everything that could have gone in this
 

833
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,390
everything that could have gone in this
position. So notice what I'm doing here

834
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
position. So notice what I'm doing here
 

835
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,070
position. So notice what I'm doing here
is

836
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,080
is
 

837
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,549
is
let me make this notation very clear for

838
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
let me make this notation very clear for
 

839
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,190
let me make this notation very clear for
you. Okay, hold on.

840
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
you. Okay, hold on.
 

841
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:06,310
you. Okay, hold on.
What I mean here is

842
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320

 

843
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,470

I'm doing the generation sequentially,

844
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
I'm doing the generation sequentially,
 

845
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,390
I'm doing the generation sequentially,
but I want to maximize the entire

846
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:10,400
but I want to maximize the entire
 

847
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,789
but I want to maximize the entire
sequence of length capital T. That's why

848
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
sequence of length capital T. That's why
 

849
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,710
sequence of length capital T. That's why
this is up to capital T. This is the

850
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
this is up to capital T. This is the
 

851
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,789
this is up to capital T. This is the
position we're talking about. But

852
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
position we're talking about. But
 

853
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,230
position we're talking about. But
there's also everything that's going to

854
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
there's also everything that's going to
 

855
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,750
there's also everything that's going to
come after.

856
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:21,760

 

857
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,950

And so when I think about the

858
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:22,960
And so when I think about the
 

859
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,950
And so when I think about the
probability

860
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
probability
 

861
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,590
probability
for this position, I have to integrate

862
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
for this position, I have to integrate
 

863
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,110
for this position, I have to integrate
out everything that's going to come

864
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
out everything that's going to come
 

865
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,190
out everything that's going to come
after.

866
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
after.
 

867
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,310
after.
Okay, so these guys are the ones that

868
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,320
Okay, so these guys are the ones that
 

869
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:45,909
Okay, so these guys are the ones that
we label this.

870
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:45,919

 

871
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,110

Okay, that's what that's doing.

872
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
Okay, that's what that's doing.
 

873
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,029
Okay, that's what that's doing.
Okay, I sort of put it I'm doing this on

874
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
Okay, I sort of put it I'm doing this on
 

875
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,870
Okay, I sort of put it I'm doing this on
purpose so you can see uh you know the

876
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
purpose so you can see uh you know the
 

877
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,269
purpose so you can see uh you know the
the comparison with what happens if you

878
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,279
the comparison with what happens if you
 

879
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,710
the comparison with what happens if you
do low temperature sampling. So I'm just

880
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:56,720
do low temperature sampling. So I'm just
 

881
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,110
do low temperature sampling. So I'm just
setting it up for you. Okay, everyone

882
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
setting it up for you. Okay, everyone
 

883
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,590
setting it up for you. Okay, everyone
clear? This is what you want.

884
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
clear? This is what you want.
 

885
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,269
clear? This is what you want.
Okay, so I want to generate tokens one

886
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279
Okay, so I want to generate tokens one
 

887
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,390
Okay, so I want to generate tokens one
at a time with this probability

888
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:06,400
at a time with this probability
 

889
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,870
at a time with this probability
if I could, right? Is that what low

890
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
if I could, right? Is that what low
 

891
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,149
if I could, right? Is that what low
temperature sampling does?

892
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
temperature sampling does?
 

893
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,630
temperature sampling does?
Okay, so the corresponding low

894
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
Okay, so the corresponding low
 

895
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,590
Okay, so the corresponding low
temperature sampling, what does it do?

896
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
temperature sampling, what does it do?
 

897
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,750
temperature sampling, what does it do?
It doesn't do this integrating out,

898
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
It doesn't do this integrating out,
 

899
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,669
It doesn't do this integrating out,
right? What it's doing the low

900
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:23,679
right? What it's doing the low
 

901
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,430
right? What it's doing the low
temperatur

902
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440

 

903
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,510

equal to one and raising it to a higher

904
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
equal to one and raising it to a higher
 

905
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,710
equal to one and raising it to a higher
power. Remember there's like a one over

906
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
power. Remember there's like a one over
 

907
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,549
power. Remember there's like a one over
temp one over temperature uh thing. So

908
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
temp one over temperature uh thing. So
 

909
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,950
temp one over temperature uh thing. So
that's what this is doing.

910
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:36,960
that's what this is doing.
 

911
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,149
that's what this is doing.
Everyone good with that? And then I

912
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
Everyone good with that? And then I
 

913
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,630
Everyone good with that? And then I
normalize that. There's no integrating

914
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
normalize that. There's no integrating
 

915
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,590
normalize that. There's no integrating
out the future.

916
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:43,600
out the future.
 

917
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,990
out the future.
Questions? That's like mathematically

918
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,000
Questions? That's like mathematically
 

919
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,990
Questions? That's like mathematically
what's different. Yeah. differentiation

920
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,000
what's different. Yeah. differentiation
 

921
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,549
what's different. Yeah. differentiation
step.

922
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:50,559
step.
 

923
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,710
step.
>> Yeah. The thing is so the it's like yes

924
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:52,720
>> Yeah. The thing is so the it's like yes
 

925
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,630
>> Yeah. The thing is so the it's like yes
it's one step versus the whole sequence.

926
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:54,640
it's one step versus the whole sequence.
 

927
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,549
it's one step versus the whole sequence.
So people get a little confused about

928
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
So people get a little confused about
 

929
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,149
So people get a little confused about
this because you think if I take the

930
00:25:58,149 --> 00:25:58,159
this because you think if I take the
 

931
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,190
this because you think if I take the
probabilities and I'm going to be

932
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,200
probabilities and I'm going to be
 

933
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,190
probabilities and I'm going to be
multiplying them together. If I take

934
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,200
multiplying them together. If I take
 

935
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,950
multiplying them together. If I take
probabilities and multiply them together

936
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
probabilities and multiply them together
 

937
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,190
probabilities and multiply them together
raising that product to a power is

938
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
raising that product to a power is
 

939
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,269
raising that product to a power is
taking each individual term raising it

940
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:07,279
taking each individual term raising it
 

941
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,470
taking each individual term raising it
to a power and multiplying them

942
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:08,480
to a power and multiplying them
 

943
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,789
to a power and multiplying them
together.

944
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:10,799
together.
 

945
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,430
together.
That's why people get confused for so

946
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,440
That's why people get confused for so
 

947
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,149
That's why people get confused for so
for the individual terms raising to a

948
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
for the individual terms raising to a
 

949
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,950
for the individual terms raising to a
power that's true but the normalization

950
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
power that's true but the normalization
 

951
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,590
power that's true but the normalization
makes a difference and so that's how you

952
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
makes a difference and so that's how you
 

953
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,390
makes a difference and so that's how you
can think of it this way. Okay so this

954
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
can think of it this way. Okay so this
 

955
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,590
can think of it this way. Okay so this
is these two are different from each

956
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,600
is these two are different from each
 

957
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,190
is these two are different from each
other

958
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,200
other
 

959
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,950
other
so how do we see that they're different?

960
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960
so how do we see that they're different?
 

961
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,669
so how do we see that they're different?
Let's bring in all the terms we were

962
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:31,679
Let's bring in all the terms we were
 

963
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,870
Let's bring in all the terms we were
integrating out. Okay. So I take this

964
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880
integrating out. Okay. So I take this
 

965
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,870
integrating out. Okay. So I take this
probability and I write it with the same

966
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880
probability and I write it with the same
 

967
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,669
probability and I write it with the same
integrating out business.

968
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:39,679
integrating out business.
 

969
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,990
integrating out business.
But now you see the difference is that

970
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
But now you see the difference is that
 

971
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,029
But now you see the difference is that
over there I have a sum of sum of things

972
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:45,039
over there I have a sum of sum of things
 

973
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,269
over there I have a sum of sum of things
raised to powers and here I have a sum

974
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:47,279
raised to powers and here I have a sum
 

975
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,830
raised to powers and here I have a sum
raised to a power and those two aren't

976
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:49,840
raised to a power and those two aren't
 

977
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,590
raised to a power and those two aren't
the same. Right? You can't you can't

978
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
the same. Right? You can't you can't
 

979
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,430
the same. Right? You can't you can't
take a power and bring it inside of a

980
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
take a power and bring it inside of a
 

981
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,510
take a power and bring it inside of a
sum. Right? That's not legal.

982
00:26:59,510 --> 00:26:59,520
sum. Right? That's not legal.
 

983
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,510
sum. Right? That's not legal.
Okay?

984
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
Okay?
 

985
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,269
Okay?
So that's why they're not the same.

986
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:05,279
So that's why they're not the same.
 

987
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,110
So that's why they're not the same.
So this can't be accomplished by just

988
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,120
So this can't be accomplished by just
 

989
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,630
So this can't be accomplished by just
low temperature sampling. Low

990
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:08,640
low temperature sampling. Low
 

991
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,230
low temperature sampling. Low
temperature sampling is going to move

992
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
temperature sampling is going to move
 

993
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,029
temperature sampling is going to move
you towards higher probability things a

994
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:13,039
you towards higher probability things a
 

995
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,470
you towards higher probability things a
little bit, but you know, not

996
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,480
little bit, but you know, not
 

997
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,789
little bit, but you know, not
necessarily. In fact, that's why when

998
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
necessarily. In fact, that's why when
 

999
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,470
necessarily. In fact, that's why when
you're doing generations, you typically

1000
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,480
you're doing generations, you typically
 

1001
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,149
you're doing generations, you typically
don't all do generations always with

1002
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:22,159
don't all do generations always with
 

1003
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,310
don't all do generations always with
lowest temperature sampling because you

1004
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,320
lowest temperature sampling because you
 

1005
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,070
lowest temperature sampling because you
actually get bad responses if you go to

1006
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
actually get bad responses if you go to
 

1007
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,669
actually get bad responses if you go to
very low temperature sampling.

1008
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
very low temperature sampling.
 

1009
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,110
very low temperature sampling.
Okay.

1010
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,120
Okay.
 

1011
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,190
Okay.
So everyone's good with this

1012
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,200
So everyone's good with this
 

1013
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,669
So everyone's good with this
explanation.

1014
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:35,679
explanation.
 

1015
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,390
explanation.
Okay. So this is not the same thing.

1016
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:40,400
Okay. So this is not the same thing.
 

1017
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,029
Okay. So this is not the same thing.
So now the question is how can you do

1018
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,039
So now the question is how can you do
 

1019
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,549
So now the question is how can you do
this? Yeah.

1020
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:44,559
this? Yeah.
 

1021
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,029
this? Yeah.
>> I was just or actually I was just

1022
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
>> I was just or actually I was just
 

1023
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,789
>> I was just or actually I was just
wondering how do you actually you know

1024
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
wondering how do you actually you know
 

1025
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,190
wondering how do you actually you know
add up

1026
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:51,200
add up
 

1027
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,710
add up
like you don't know.

1028
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720
like you don't know.
 

1029
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,389
like you don't know.
>> Oh exactly. Okay. So now that's the

1030
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:54,399
>> Oh exactly. Okay. So now that's the
 

1031
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,470
>> Oh exactly. Okay. So now that's the
point right. So now there's an obvious

1032
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:56,480
point right. So now there's an obvious
 

1033
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,310
point right. So now there's an obvious
easy way that you could try to sample

1034
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,320
easy way that you could try to sample
 

1035
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,789
easy way that you could try to sample
from the distribution which raises to a

1036
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:00,799
from the distribution which raises to a
 

1037
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,269
from the distribution which raises to a
power but that's low temperature

1038
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:03,279
power but that's low temperature
 

1039
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,149
power but that's low temperature
sampling but it doesn't work.

1040
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:06,159
sampling but it doesn't work.
 

1041
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,750
sampling but it doesn't work.
So now the question is how can you do

1042
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:07,760
So now the question is how can you do
 

1043
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,909
So now the question is how can you do
it?

1044
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:09,919
it?
 

1045
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,110
it?
Okay and that's the name of the game.

1046
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,120
Okay and that's the name of the game.
 

1047
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,269
Okay and that's the name of the game.
So what this paper does is it says that

1048
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:17,279
So what this paper does is it says that
 

1049
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,310
So what this paper does is it says that
we actually have in

1050
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,320
we actually have in
 

1051
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,789
we actually have in
a lot of science and engineering um

1052
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:22,799
a lot of science and engineering um
 

1053
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,190
a lot of science and engineering um
statistical physics and so on we have

1054
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,200
statistical physics and so on we have
 

1055
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,310
statistical physics and so on we have
techniques for doing this kind of a

1056
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,320
techniques for doing this kind of a
 

1057
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,310
techniques for doing this kind of a
thing. Okay, what's the kind of a thing

1058
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,320
thing. Okay, what's the kind of a thing
 

1059
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,389
thing. Okay, what's the kind of a thing
we want? We want to sample from a

1060
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:32,399
we want? We want to sample from a
 

1061
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,789
we want? We want to sample from a
desired distribution where we don't have

1062
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
desired distribution where we don't have
 

1063
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,510
desired distribution where we don't have
access to the distribution but instead

1064
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:37,520
access to the distribution but instead
 

1065
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,870
access to the distribution but instead
have access to something which is

1066
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
have access to something which is
 

1067
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,070
have access to something which is
proportional to the distribution.

1068
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
proportional to the distribution.
 

1069
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,110
proportional to the distribution.
Because what's different here is this

1070
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,120
Because what's different here is this
 

1071
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,830
Because what's different here is this
normalization.

1072
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
normalization.
 

1073
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,510
normalization.
Okay. And the normalization doesn't

1074
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:47,520
Okay. And the normalization doesn't
 

1075
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,350
Okay. And the normalization doesn't
care, right? The whole point of

1076
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:49,360
care, right? The whole point of
 

1077
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,470
care, right? The whole point of
normalization is just trying to make

1078
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:50,480
normalization is just trying to make
 

1079
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,110
normalization is just trying to make
everything become probability. And so

1080
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,120
everything become probability. And so
 

1081
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,070
everything become probability. And so
the technique that's used to do that

1082
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,080
the technique that's used to do that
 

1083
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,710
the technique that's used to do that
is called one standard technique is

1084
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:58,720
is called one standard technique is
 

1085
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,510
is called one standard technique is
called uh

1086
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:01,520
called uh
 

1087
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,110
called uh
markup chain Monte Carlo sampling. And

1088
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,120
markup chain Monte Carlo sampling. And
 

1089
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,669
markup chain Monte Carlo sampling. And
so the idea here something like refresh

1090
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:07,679
so the idea here something like refresh
 

1091
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,470
so the idea here something like refresh
your memory from your probability class.

1092
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
your memory from your probability class.
 

1093
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,470
your memory from your probability class.
So in your probability class you saw

1094
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,480
So in your probability class you saw
 

1095
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,590
So in your probability class you saw
that there's something called a markoff

1096
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
that there's something called a markoff
 

1097
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,149
that there's something called a markoff
chain right which is basically you set

1098
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:18,159
chain right which is basically you set
 

1099
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,870
chain right which is basically you set
up a situation in which there are

1100
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:20,880
up a situation in which there are
 

1101
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,870
up a situation in which there are
transitions that go from one state to

1102
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:22,880
transitions that go from one state to
 

1103
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,470
transitions that go from one state to
another state and you can evolve across

1104
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:26,480
another state and you can evolve across
 

1105
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,510
another state and you can evolve across
these states. And you remember from your

1106
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:29,520
these states. And you remember from your
 

1107
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,990
these states. And you remember from your
markoff chain thinking that there's the

1108
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,000
markoff chain thinking that there's the
 

1109
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,430
markoff chain thinking that there's the
idea of a stationary distribution of

1110
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,440
idea of a stationary distribution of
 

1111
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,870
idea of a stationary distribution of
your markoff chain which is what happens

1112
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880
your markoff chain which is what happens
 

1113
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,269
your markoff chain which is what happens
intuitively if you let the markoff chain

1114
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
intuitively if you let the markoff chain
 

1115
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,669
intuitively if you let the markoff chain
run for a very long time without looking

1116
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
run for a very long time without looking
 

1117
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,310
run for a very long time without looking
at it. You just let it run and you

1118
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,320
at it. You just let it run and you
 

1119
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,830
at it. You just let it run and you
sample then you're going to sample from

1120
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
sample then you're going to sample from
 

1121
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,110
sample then you're going to sample from
the stationary distribution. Everyone

1122
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,120
the stationary distribution. Everyone
 

1123
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,909
the stationary distribution. Everyone
remember this? And so if you remember

1124
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:49,919
remember this? And so if you remember
 

1125
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,350
remember this? And so if you remember
I'll try I'm not going to teach you Mont

1126
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,360
I'll try I'm not going to teach you Mont
 

1127
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,669
I'll try I'm not going to teach you Mont
mark um mark up you know Monte Carlo um

1128
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:55,679
mark um mark up you know Monte Carlo um
 

1129
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,430
mark um mark up you know Monte Carlo um
but

1130
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:57,440
but
 

1131
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,510
but
the the

1132
00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,520
the the
 

1133
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,149
the the
if you remember the conditions that for

1134
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
if you remember the conditions that for
 

1135
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,070
if you remember the conditions that for
computing the stationary distribution

1136
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,080
computing the stationary distribution
 

1137
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,830
computing the stationary distribution
there's two ways of thinking about it

1138
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
there's two ways of thinking about it
 

1139
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,269
there's two ways of thinking about it
right there's the igen value perspective

1140
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:07,279
right there's the igen value perspective
 

1141
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,350
right there's the igen value perspective
which is very important um there's also

1142
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,360
which is very important um there's also
 

1143
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,590
which is very important um there's also
the perspective that says you have to

1144
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:11,600
the perspective that says you have to
 

1145
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,029
the perspective that says you have to
have the distribution is invariant under

1146
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
have the distribution is invariant under
 

1147
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,950
have the distribution is invariant under
the matrix that represents the markoff

1148
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:18,960
the matrix that represents the markoff
 

1149
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,110
the matrix that represents the markoff
chain. Um, but you can also think of it

1150
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,120
chain. Um, but you can also think of it
 

1151
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,149
chain. Um, but you can also think of it
in terms of balance, right? That the

1152
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:24,159
in terms of balance, right? That the
 

1153
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,350
in terms of balance, right? That the
probability flowing into a node is equal

1154
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,360
probability flowing into a node is equal
 

1155
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,789
probability flowing into a node is equal
to the probability flowing out of the

1156
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:28,799
to the probability flowing out of the
 

1157
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,789
to the probability flowing out of the
node. When that is true, then you're in

1158
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,799
node. When that is true, then you're in
 

1159
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,110
node. When that is true, then you're in
a stationary distribution. And the key

1160
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,120
a stationary distribution. And the key
 

1161
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,710
a stationary distribution. And the key
thing is that for those for that kind of

1162
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:36,720
thing is that for those for that kind of
 

1163
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,389
thing is that for those for that kind of
thinking, you can if you if you know the

1164
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:40,399
thinking, you can if you if you know the
 

1165
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,830
thinking, you can if you if you know the
distribution you want and you have

1166
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:41,840
distribution you want and you have
 

1167
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,830
distribution you want and you have
something that's proportional, you can

1168
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:43,840
something that's proportional, you can
 

1169
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,669
something that's proportional, you can
rig it so that the transition

1170
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:45,679
rig it so that the transition
 

1171
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,510
rig it so that the transition
probabilities work out so that the

1172
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,520
probabilities work out so that the
 

1173
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,710
probabilities work out so that the
stationary distribution is the

1174
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:48,720
stationary distribution is the
 

1175
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,029
stationary distribution is the
distribution you want. That's the idea.

1176
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:53,039
distribution you want. That's the idea.
 

1177
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,510
distribution you want. That's the idea.
And then what you do is you initialize

1178
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
And then what you do is you initialize
 

1179
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,950
And then what you do is you initialize
somehow and you just take steps in this

1180
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
somehow and you just take steps in this
 

1181
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,990
somehow and you just take steps in this
markup chain. And the hope is that the

1182
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,000
markup chain. And the hope is that the
 

1183
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,149
markup chain. And the hope is that the
Markov chain will quickly converge to a

1184
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:04,159
Markov chain will quickly converge to a
 

1185
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,510
Markov chain will quickly converge to a
stationary distribution and you'll end

1186
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:05,520
stationary distribution and you'll end
 

1187
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,190
stationary distribution and you'll end
up sample from the stationary

1188
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,200
up sample from the stationary
 

1189
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,110
up sample from the stationary
distribution.

1190
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,120
distribution.
 

1191
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,870
distribution.
Now there's a enormous body of

1192
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
Now there's a enormous body of
 

1193
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,269
Now there's a enormous body of
literature in terms of how to make this

1194
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
literature in terms of how to make this
 

1195
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,590
literature in terms of how to make this
work what case when it works when it

1196
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:15,600
work what case when it works when it
 

1197
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,990
work what case when it works when it
doesn't work and lots of stuff but here

1198
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
doesn't work and lots of stuff but here
 

1199
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,510
doesn't work and lots of stuff but here
you have to remember there's a way of

1200
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:19,520
you have to remember there's a way of
 

1201
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,269
you have to remember there's a way of
doing this.

1202
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
doing this.
 

1203
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,830
doing this.
So the connection to test time compute

1204
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:23,840
So the connection to test time compute
 

1205
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,990
So the connection to test time compute
is the following.

1206
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,000
is the following.
 

1207
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,190
is the following.
Instead of doing one generation

1208
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
Instead of doing one generation
 

1209
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,070
Instead of doing one generation
and living with it or just taking a

1210
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
and living with it or just taking a
 

1211
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,830
and living with it or just taking a
bunch of fresh draws which is a just

1212
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:35,840
bunch of fresh draws which is a just
 

1213
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,830
bunch of fresh draws which is a just
spending compute I'm going to spend my

1214
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:37,840
spending compute I'm going to spend my
 

1215
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,590
spending compute I'm going to spend my
compute to walk along this markoff chain

1216
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:41,600
compute to walk along this markoff chain
 

1217
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,909
compute to walk along this markoff chain
and then see where I am end up. Okay,

1218
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919
and then see where I am end up. Okay,
 

1219
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,269
and then see where I am end up. Okay,
that's what this paper is saying.

1220
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
that's what this paper is saying.
 

1221
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,870
that's what this paper is saying.
Okay, and thereby sampling from a higher

1222
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:48,880
Okay, and thereby sampling from a higher
 

1223
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,909
Okay, and thereby sampling from a higher
probability part for sequences.

1224
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:51,919
probability part for sequences.
 

1225
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,549
probability part for sequences.
So how do they do it? So the challenge

1226
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:54,559
So how do they do it? So the challenge
 

1227
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,830
So how do they do it? So the challenge
is the state space is enormous.

1228
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
is the state space is enormous.
 

1229
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,070
is the state space is enormous.
It's huge, right? It's all utterances of

1230
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,080
It's huge, right? It's all utterances of
 

1231
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,950
It's huge, right? It's all utterances of
length t. So how do you make this work?

1232
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:02,960
length t. So how do you make this work?
 

1233
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,789
length t. So how do you make this work?
So what they have is they have ideas

1234
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:04,799
So what they have is they have ideas
 

1235
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,830
So what they have is they have ideas
inspired by techniques in um MCMC.

1236
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:09,840
inspired by techniques in um MCMC.
 

1237
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,669
inspired by techniques in um MCMC.
So I'll write the algorithmic approach

1238
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:11,679
So I'll write the algorithmic approach
 

1239
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,950
So I'll write the algorithmic approach
from the paper. It's copied from the

1240
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:12,960
from the paper. It's copied from the
 

1241
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,789
from the paper. It's copied from the
paper and sort of try to walk you

1242
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:14,799
paper and sort of try to walk you
 

1243
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,870
paper and sort of try to walk you
through the key ideas.

1244
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:16,880
through the key ideas.
 

1245
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,710
through the key ideas.
So first key idea

1246
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
So first key idea
 

1247
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,590
So first key idea
is look this is the kind of thing you

1248
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600
is look this is the kind of thing you
 

1249
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,990
is look this is the kind of thing you
want

1250
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,000
want
 

1251
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,389
want
probability raised to some power alpha

1252
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:28,399
probability raised to some power alpha
 

1253
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,470
probability raised to some power alpha
and so the what they're going to do is

1254
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:30,480
and so the what they're going to do is
 

1255
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,190
and so the what they're going to do is
instead of sampling from the entire

1256
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,200
instead of sampling from the entire
 

1257
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,750
instead of sampling from the entire
thing they're going to do it in stages

1258
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:35,760
thing they're going to do it in stages
 

1259
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,430
thing they're going to do it in stages
they're going to say first I'll take a

1260
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:37,440
they're going to say first I'll take a
 

1261
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,509
they're going to say first I'll take a
small block

1262
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:39,519
small block
 

1263
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,909
small block
and I'll take some steps along my markup

1264
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:41,919
and I'll take some steps along my markup
 

1265
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,350
and I'll take some steps along my markup
chain for this small block at the

1266
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,360
chain for this small block at the
 

1267
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,029
chain for this small block at the
beginning having found a suitable thing

1268
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:47,039
beginning having found a suitable thing
 

1269
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,630
beginning having found a suitable thing
here. I'll seed the next block with that

1270
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:50,640
here. I'll seed the next block with that
 

1271
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,070
here. I'll seed the next block with that
block. I'll fix that. That block is

1272
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,080
block. I'll fix that. That block is
 

1273
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,230
block. I'll fix that. That block is
fixed for a moment, right? I'll seed the

1274
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:54,240
fixed for a moment, right? I'll seed the
 

1275
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,070
fixed for a moment, right? I'll seed the
next block, but now I'll take steps in

1276
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,080
next block, but now I'll take steps in
 

1277
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,470
next block, but now I'll take steps in
this larger block, including changing

1278
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:58,480
this larger block, including changing
 

1279
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,029
this larger block, including changing
stuff in the earlier block.

1280
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:01,039
stuff in the earlier block.
 

1281
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,710
stuff in the earlier block.
Okay? Then I'll go again to another

1282
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
Okay? Then I'll go again to another
 

1283
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,950
Okay? Then I'll go again to another
larger block and I'll change the entire

1284
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:06,960
larger block and I'll change the entire
 

1285
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,909
larger block and I'll change the entire
block kind of step by step out. and with

1286
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:09,919
block kind of step by step out. and with
 

1287
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,669
block kind of step by step out. and with
the idea that over a small block it's a

1288
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:11,679
the idea that over a small block it's a
 

1289
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,029
the idea that over a small block it's a
smaller state space and I'll hopefully

1290
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:13,039
smaller state space and I'll hopefully
 

1291
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,669
smaller state space and I'll hopefully
get to a good distribution to start with

1292
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
get to a good distribution to start with
 

1293
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,630
get to a good distribution to start with
and then I can get to

1294
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:18,640
and then I can get to
 

1295
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,310
and then I can get to
having seated myself in a good

1296
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,320
having seated myself in a good
 

1297
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,350
having seated myself in a good
distribution I can evolve my markoff

1298
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
distribution I can evolve my markoff
 

1299
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,430
distribution I can evolve my markoff
chain better and therefore converge

1300
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:25,440
chain better and therefore converge
 

1301
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,509
chain better and therefore converge
better okay that's the idea everyone

1302
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:27,519
better okay that's the idea everyone
 

1303
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,509
better okay that's the idea everyone
here see the kind of core idea here I'm

1304
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:29,519
here see the kind of core idea here I'm
 

1305
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,750
here see the kind of core idea here I'm
trying to describe okay so I'm going to

1306
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:31,760
trying to describe okay so I'm going to
 

1307
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,470
trying to describe okay so I'm going to
be doing lots of generations

1308
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,480
be doing lots of generations
 

1309
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,630
be doing lots of generations
and so let me show how that works so K

1310
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,640
and so let me show how that works so K
 

1311
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,590
and so let me show how that works so K
here is how I'm iterating across these

1312
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,600
here is how I'm iterating across these
 

1313
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,149
here is how I'm iterating across these
blocks. Okay, so I'm going to start with

1314
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
blocks. Okay, so I'm going to start with
 

1315
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,470
blocks. Okay, so I'm going to start with
so B is the size of the block. KB is the

1316
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:46,480
so B is the size of the block. KB is the
 

1317
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,430
so B is the size of the block. KB is the
total length that I want to finally get

1318
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
total length that I want to finally get
 

1319
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,110
total length that I want to finally get
to.

1320
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,120
to.
 

1321
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,149
to.
And so

1322
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:54,159
And so
 

1323
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,470
And so
I have some prefix that I already have.

1324
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,480
I have some prefix that I already have.
 

1325
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,669
I have some prefix that I already have.
Uh then I sample from something bigger.

1326
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:01,679
Uh then I sample from something bigger.
 

1327
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,870
Uh then I sample from something bigger.
I initialize by just

1328
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:04,880
I initialize by just
 

1329
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,710
I initialize by just
sampling

1330
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:06,720
sampling
 

1331
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,790
sampling
from my proposing distribution which is

1332
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:08,800
from my proposing distribution which is
 

1333
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,629
from my proposing distribution which is
my LLM for the next part. Okay. So I

1334
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
my LLM for the next part. Okay. So I
 

1335
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,909
my LLM for the next part. Okay. So I
start with something I expand it. Okay.

1336
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:15,919
start with something I expand it. Okay.
 

1337
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,109
start with something I expand it. Okay.
That's this step.

1338
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:19,119
That's this step.
 

1339
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,510
That's this step.
Then I do n MCMC steps

1340
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:23,520
Then I do n MCMC steps
 

1341
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,430
Then I do n MCMC steps
which are going to pick a random

1342
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:25,440
which are going to pick a random
 

1343
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,950
which are going to pick a random
position

1344
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:26,960
position
 

1345
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,510
position
in this block the entire block.

1346
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:31,520
in this block the entire block.
 

1347
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,470
in this block the entire block.
and then say restart generation at that

1348
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:34,480
and then say restart generation at that
 

1349
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,669
and then say restart generation at that
point.

1350
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:37,679

 

1351
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,430

Okay, so now I have a new distribute a

1352
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:39,440
Okay, so now I have a new distribute a
 

1353
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,069
Okay, so now I have a new distribute a
new a new candidate. The key thing in

1354
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:44,079
new a new candidate. The key thing in
 

1355
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,829
new a new candidate. The key thing in
MCMC is to say you can think back to

1356
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:47,839
MCMC is to say you can think back to
 

1357
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,829
MCMC is to say you can think back to
markoff chains. If you have a markup

1358
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:49,839
markoff chains. If you have a markup
 

1359
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:50,869
markoff chains. If you have a markup
chain, you want to get the balance

1360
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:50,879
chain, you want to get the balance
 

1361
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:51,990
chain, you want to get the balance
conditions right, there's some

1362
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000
conditions right, there's some
 

1363
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,909
conditions right, there's some
probability you stay in the state that

1364
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,919
probability you stay in the state that
 

1365
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,829
probability you stay in the state that
doesn't matter,

1366
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:55,839
doesn't matter,
 

1367
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,349
doesn't matter,
right? It's the probability flow out

1368
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
right? It's the probability flow out
 

1369
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,069
right? It's the probability flow out
versus flow in that matters.

1370
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:00,079
versus flow in that matters.
 

1371
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,310
versus flow in that matters.
And so for any pair, if the probability

1372
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,320
And so for any pair, if the probability
 

1373
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,790
And so for any pair, if the probability
of flowing out and in balance, you're in

1374
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
of flowing out and in balance, you're in
 

1375
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,470
of flowing out and in balance, you're in
a steady state. So that's the trick. So

1376
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,480
a steady state. So that's the trick. So
 

1377
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,829
a steady state. So that's the trick. So
what you do is you say, I need to

1378
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:09,839
what you do is you say, I need to
 

1379
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,430
what you do is you say, I need to
basically figure out what probability am

1380
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,440
basically figure out what probability am
 

1381
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,069
basically figure out what probability am
I going to reject this move, which means

1382
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:14,079
I going to reject this move, which means
 

1383
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,829
I going to reject this move, which means
stay where I am.

1384
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:17,839

 

1385
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,670

So I compute I can of course compute

1386
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:21,680
So I compute I can of course compute
 

1387
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,589
So I compute I can of course compute
what the probability would be under

1388
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:23,599
what the probability would be under
 

1389
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,310
what the probability would be under
proportional to my desired distribution

1390
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
proportional to my desired distribution
 

1391
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,630
proportional to my desired distribution
and I can look at the ratios. So this is

1392
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:28,640
and I can look at the ratios. So this is
 

1393
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,829
and I can look at the ratios. So this is
like comparing the stationary

1394
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:29,839
like comparing the stationary
 

1395
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,470
like comparing the stationary
distribution in the two states

1396
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:32,480
distribution in the two states
 

1397
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,270
distribution in the two states
okay by proportion and then I look at

1398
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
okay by proportion and then I look at
 

1399
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,550
okay by proportion and then I look at
the proportion of the probability of

1400
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:38,560
the proportion of the probability of
 

1401
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,710
the proportion of the probability of
making that transition. So it's written

1402
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:40,720
making that transition. So it's written
 

1403
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,390
making that transition. So it's written
it's written this way to connect to

1404
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,400
it's written this way to connect to
 

1405
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,390
it's written this way to connect to
markoff chain thinking. But what this

1406
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
markoff chain thinking. But what this
 

1407
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,790
markoff chain thinking. But what this
thing turns into

1408
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:46,800
thing turns into
 

1409
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,630
thing turns into
is just because because of how the auto

1410
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:48,640
is just because because of how the auto
 

1411
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,950
is just because because of how the auto
reggressive generation works is you just

1412
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:50,960
reggressive generation works is you just
 

1413
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,870
reggressive generation works is you just
look at

1414
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:52,880
look at
 

1415
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,349
look at
the ratio of the probability of these

1416
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:55,359
the ratio of the probability of these
 

1417
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,510
the ratio of the probability of these
two things because the conditioning just

1418
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:57,520
two things because the conditioning just
 

1419
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,069
two things because the conditioning just
cancels out in the probabilities because

1420
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:00,079
cancels out in the probabilities because
 

1421
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,630
cancels out in the probabilities because
remember the the LM is generating things

1422
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:02,640
remember the the LM is generating things
 

1423
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,910
remember the the LM is generating things
one at a time as conditional

1424
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:03,920
one at a time as conditional
 

1425
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,030
one at a time as conditional
probabilities producting each other. So

1426
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,040
probabilities producting each other. So
 

1427
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,430
probabilities producting each other. So
the common prefix just falls out just

1428
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:09,440
the common prefix just falls out just
 

1429
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,950
the common prefix just falls out just
going to cancel. So you just look at the

1430
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:10,960
going to cancel. So you just look at the
 

1431
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,670
going to cancel. So you just look at the
ratio of the of the two probabilities is

1432
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:13,680
ratio of the of the two probabilities is
 

1433
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,109
ratio of the of the two probabilities is
all this is.

1434
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:17,119

 

1435
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,550

And of course a probability can't be

1436
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:18,560
And of course a probability can't be
 

1437
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,150
And of course a probability can't be
bigger than one. So the best thing you

1438
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,160
bigger than one. So the best thing you
 

1439
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,430
bigger than one. So the best thing you
could the highest thing you can do is

1440
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:23,440
could the highest thing you can do is
 

1441
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,470
could the highest thing you can do is
just accept it right always you know

1442
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:26,480
just accept it right always you know
 

1443
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,150
just accept it right always you know
just take take the move with some

1444
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
just take take the move with some
 

1445
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,829
just take take the move with some
probability you'll take moves otherwise.

1446
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:29,839
probability you'll take moves otherwise.
 

1447
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,109
probability you'll take moves otherwise.
So what does this turn into? Right? The

1448
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:33,119
So what does this turn into? Right? The
 

1449
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,470
So what does this turn into? Right? The
interesting thing in the paper is it

1450
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:34,480
interesting thing in the paper is it
 

1451
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,310
interesting thing in the paper is it
doesn't go through the next steps of the

1452
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,320
doesn't go through the next steps of the
 

1453
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,550
doesn't go through the next steps of the
calculation. But we can. So

1454
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:40,560
calculation. But we can. So
 

1455
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,750
calculation. But we can. So
if this probability you're going for is

1456
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:43,760
if this probability you're going for is
 

1457
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,310
if this probability you're going for is
just the probability of your LM raised

1458
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:46,320
just the probability of your LM raised
 

1459
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,270
just the probability of your LM raised
to a power. This is the probability of X

1460
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,280
to a power. This is the probability of X
 

1461
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,190
to a power. This is the probability of X
prime raised to a power. This is the

1462
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,200
prime raised to a power. This is the
 

1463
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,150
prime raised to a power. This is the
probability of X raised to a power is

1464
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,160
probability of X raised to a power is
 

1465
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,230
probability of X raised to a power is
this ratio.

1466
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,240
this ratio.
 

1467
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,310
this ratio.
Okay? because ratio doesn't that's all

1468
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,320
Okay? because ratio doesn't that's all
 

1469
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,030
Okay? because ratio doesn't that's all
that you need for the ratio. This is

1470
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,040
that you need for the ratio. This is
 

1471
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,430
that you need for the ratio. This is
just the probability of X without being

1472
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:03,440
just the probability of X without being
 

1473
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,270
just the probability of X without being
raised to a power. This is just the

1474
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,280
raised to a power. This is just the
 

1475
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,710
raised to a power. This is just the
probability of X prime without being

1476
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:06,720
probability of X prime without being
 

1477
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,790
probability of X prime without being
raised to a power.

1478
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:08,800
raised to a power.
 

1479
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,349
raised to a power.
So you just get the probability

1480
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:11,359
So you just get the probability
 

1481
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,670
So you just get the probability
that this will cancel with some of this.

1482
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:13,680
that this will cancel with some of this.
 

1483
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,910
that this will cancel with some of this.
This will cancel with some of this and

1484
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
This will cancel with some of this and
 

1485
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,990
This will cancel with some of this and
you just get the ratio of the two

1486
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,000
you just get the ratio of the two
 

1487
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,109
you just get the ratio of the two
probabilities raised to a smaller power

1488
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:21,119
probabilities raised to a smaller power
 

1489
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,310
probabilities raised to a smaller power
by one. That's all it is. So what does

1490
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:24,320
by one. That's all it is. So what does
 

1491
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,349
by one. That's all it is. So what does
it mean? This particular algorithm

1492
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:27,359
it mean? This particular algorithm
 

1493
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,750
it mean? This particular algorithm
will always accept a move to a higher

1494
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:29,760
will always accept a move to a higher
 

1495
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,790
will always accept a move to a higher
probability sequence

1496
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:32,800
probability sequence
 

1497
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,150
probability sequence
because that ratio will be bigger than

1498
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,160
because that ratio will be bigger than
 

1499
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,790
because that ratio will be bigger than
one.

1500
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:36,800
one.
 

1501
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,109
one.
But it'll sometimes accept a move to a

1502
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:39,119
But it'll sometimes accept a move to a
 

1503
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,750
But it'll sometimes accept a move to a
lower probability one two.

1504
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:43,760

 

1505
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:51,750

Okay, that's what this thing is doing.

1506
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:51,760

 

1507
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,430

Any questions?

1508
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,440
Any questions?
 

1509
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,550
Any questions?
Yeah.

1510
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:54,560
Yeah.
 

1511
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,670
Yeah.
>> So like at a very high level it's just

1512
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:57,680
>> So like at a very high level it's just
 

1513
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,310

1515
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,990

ways.
 

1517
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,190
ways.
>> Yeah. So it's doing is it's saying I'm

1518
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,200
>> Yeah. So it's doing is it's saying I'm
 

1519
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,109
>> Yeah. So it's doing is it's saying I'm
going to generate. So here's a not quite

1520
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:05,119
going to generate. So here's a not quite
 

1521
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,950
going to generate. So here's a not quite
right response. Like this is not talking

1522
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:06,960
right response. Like this is not talking
 

1523
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,790
right response. Like this is not talking
about the seating part. So without the

1524
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:08,800
about the seating part. So without the
 

1525
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,470
about the seating part. So without the
seeding what it's doing is it's saying

1526
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,480
seeding what it's doing is it's saying
 

1527
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,870
seeding what it's doing is it's saying
let me generate a response. Let me pick

1528
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:12,880
let me generate a response. Let me pick
 

1529
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,710
let me generate a response. Let me pick
a random place in the response and just

1530
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:14,720
a random place in the response and just
 

1531
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,589
a random place in the response and just
like regenerate from that point forward.

1532
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:17,599
like regenerate from that point forward.
 

1533
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,829
like regenerate from that point forward.
Is this a higher probability or a lower

1534
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:19,839
Is this a higher probability or a lower
 

1535
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,510
Is this a higher probability or a lower
probability response? If it's a higher

1536
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:21,520
probability response? If it's a higher
 

1537
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,109
probability response? If it's a higher
probability response, good. If it's a

1538
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:23,119
probability response, good. If it's a
 

1539
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,270
probability response, good. If it's a
lower probability response, roll it.

1540
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,280
lower probability response, roll it.
 

1541
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,109
lower probability response, roll it.
Maybe take it and then do it again and

1542
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:27,119
Maybe take it and then do it again and
 

1543
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,190
Maybe take it and then do it again and
again and again. And this is like

1544
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,200
again and again. And this is like
 

1545
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,190
again and again. And this is like
climbing a hill stochastically in

1546
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,200
climbing a hill stochastically in
 

1547
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,750
climbing a hill stochastically in
probability is what this is doing. Of

1548
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:33,760
probability is what this is doing. Of
 

1549
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,829
probability is what this is doing. Of
course, it's also doing this like stage

00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:35,839
course, it's also doing this like stage
 

1551
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,109
course, it's also doing this like stage
wise seating to help get the

1552
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,119
wise seating to help get the
 

1553
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,710
wise seating to help get the
distribution to mix faster. Yeah.

1554
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:40,720
distribution to mix faster. Yeah.
 

1555
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,630
distribution to mix faster. Yeah.

>> Okay.

1592
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:19,119
>> Okay.
 

1593
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,190
>> Okay.
>> Is all is all inspired by all of these

1594
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,200
>> Is all is all inspired by all of these
 

1595
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,270
>> Is all is all inspired by all of these
techniques uh for uh doing MCMC and

1596
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,280
techniques uh for uh doing MCMC and
 

1597
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,670
techniques uh for uh doing MCMC and
physics problems.

1598
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:27,680
physics problems.
 

1599
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,230
physics problems.
>> Yeah.

1600
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:28,240
>> Yeah.
 

1601
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,030
>> Yeah.
>> How does that last usually? How does

1602
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,040
>> How does that last usually? How does
 

1603
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,790
>> How does that last usually? How does
that is that what you're saying about

1604
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:34,800
that is that what you're saying about
 

1605
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,790
that is that what you're saying about
>> Oh, yeah. This So if I want to accept

1606
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:36,800
>> Oh, yeah. This So if I want to accept
 

1607
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,150
>> Oh, yeah. This So if I want to accept
something with some probability, how do

1608
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,160
something with some probability, how do
 

1609
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,870
something with some probability, how do
I do it? I draw a uniform and I compare

1610
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:40,880
I do it? I draw a uniform and I compare
 

1611
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,150
I do it? I draw a uniform and I compare
it against a probability threshold.

1612
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,160
it against a probability threshold.
 

1613
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,670
it against a probability threshold.
Right? So if the probability is one, I

1614
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,680
Right? So if the probability is one, I
 

1615
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,710
Right? So if the probability is one, I
always accept because uniform is always

1616
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:46,720
always accept because uniform is always
 

1617
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,750
always accept because uniform is always
between zero and one. But if the

1618
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:47,760
between zero and one. But if the
 

1619
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,109
between zero and one. But if the
probability says this thing says I

1620
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:49,119
probability says this thing says I
 

1621
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,950
probability says this thing says I
should accept it with probability 1/2,

1622
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:50,960
should accept it with probability 1/2,
 

1623
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,790
should accept it with probability 1/2,
then I'll draw a uniform. If the uniform

1624
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:52,800
then I'll draw a uniform. If the uniform
 

1625
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,630
then I'll draw a uniform. If the uniform
comes out less than a half, I'll take

1626
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:54,640
comes out less than a half, I'll take
 

1627
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,150
comes out less than a half, I'll take
it. If it comes out bigger than half, I

1628
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,160
it. If it comes out bigger than half, I
 

1629
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,910
it. If it comes out bigger than half, I
won't take it.

1630
00:39:59,910 --> 00:39:59,920

 

1631
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,069

>> Yeah. So this are the actual sequence

1632
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:02,079
>> Yeah. So this are the actual sequence
 

1633
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,150
>> Yeah. So this are the actual sequence
generations like each of the final like

1634
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,160
generations like each of the final like
 

1635
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,670
generations like each of the final like
X12 X3

1636
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:09,680
X12 X3
 

1637
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,750
X12 X3
at their respective time.

1638
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:13,760
at their respective time.
 

1639
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,190
at their respective time.
>> No, no, this is this this is this is

1640
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,200
>> No, no, this is this this is this is
 

1641
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,990
>> No, no, this is this this is this is
generally the entire response. So this

1642
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,000
generally the entire response. So this
 

1643
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,589
generally the entire response. So this
will run and then I'll spit out a

1644
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:19,599
will run and then I'll spit out a
 

1645
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,670
will run and then I'll spit out a
Tlength response.

1646
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:21,680
Tlength response.
 

1647
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,109
Tlength response.
>> Yeah, I guess I was trying to clarify

1648
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:23,119
>> Yeah, I guess I was trying to clarify
 

1649
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,270
>> Yeah, I guess I was trying to clarify
that the each of the items in that

1650
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,280
that the each of the items in that
 

1651
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,069
that the each of the items in that
response are the result of each one of

1652
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:28,079
response are the result of each one of
 

1653
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,470
response are the result of each one of
the outer loop.

1654
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:30,480
the outer loop.
 

1655
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,270
the outer loop.
Okay, the outer loop is growing the

1656
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:33,280
Okay, the outer loop is growing the
 

1657
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,829
Okay, the outer loop is growing the
response.

1658
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:35,839
response.
 

1659
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:43,190
response.
Okay, so what this is doing,

1660
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,200

 

1661
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,670

what this outer loop, oops, what this

1662
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:45,680
what this outer loop, oops, what this
 

1663
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,990
what this outer loop, oops, what this
outer loop is doing.

1664
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,000
outer loop is doing.
 

1665
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,630
outer loop is doing.
So from here, this outer loop is it's

1666
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:50,640
So from here, this outer loop is it's
 

1667
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,950
So from here, this outer loop is it's
growing the response I'm working on. So

1668
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:52,960
growing the response I'm working on. So
 

1669
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,230
growing the response I'm working on. So
I start with working on a short

1670
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:54,240
I start with working on a short
 

1671
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,710
I start with working on a short
response. Then I work on a bigger

1672
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720
response. Then I work on a bigger
 

1673
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,710
response. Then I work on a bigger
response. Then I work on a bigger

1674
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:58,720
response. Then I work on a bigger
 

1675
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,870
response. Then I work on a bigger
response. As I as I make the response

1676
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:00,880
response. As I as I make the response
 

1677
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,030
response. As I as I make the response
that my my my scratch paper is getting

1678
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,040
that my my my scratch paper is getting
 

1679
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,150
that my my my scratch paper is getting
bigger and bigger and then my what I'm

1680
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,160
bigger and bigger and then my what I'm
 

1681
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,710
bigger and bigger and then my what I'm
doing inside my inner loop is I'm making

1682
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:08,720
doing inside my inner loop is I'm making
 

1683
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,309
doing inside my inner loop is I'm making
modifications to the current response

1684
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:12,319
modifications to the current response
 

1685
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,829
modifications to the current response
randomly. Right?

1686
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:13,839
randomly. Right?
 

1687
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,270
randomly. Right?
>> So the output is actually the final

1688
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,280
>> So the output is actually the final
 

1689
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,670
>> So the output is actually the final
result of the inner sequence like one

1690
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:17,680
result of the inner sequence like one
 

1691
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,550
result of the inner sequence like one
specific.

1692
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:18,560
specific.
 

1693
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,309
specific.
>> Yes.

1694
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:20,319
>> Yes.
 

1695
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,790
>> Yes.
>> Yes. It's one final thing. the the

1696
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:22,800
>> Yes. It's one final thing. the the
 

1697
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,790
>> Yes. It's one final thing. the the
biggest one that I get to. I will then

1698
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:24,800
biggest one that I get to. I will then
 

1699
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,589
biggest one that I get to. I will then
do this and then I'm done. I return the

1700
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:27,599
do this and then I'm done. I return the
 

1701
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,870
do this and then I'm done. I return the
result.

1702
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:30,880

 

1703
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,750

>> Yeah,

1704
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:31,760
>> Yeah,
 

1705
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,670
>> Yeah,
>> I feel like I got the idea. But now I'm

1706
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680
>> I feel like I got the idea. But now I'm
 

1707
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,470
>> I feel like I got the idea. But now I'm
confused. Where did the alpha come from?

1708
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:36,480
confused. Where did the alpha come from?
 

1709
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,150
confused. Where did the alpha come from?
How do we know it's proportional?

1710
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
How do we know it's proportional?
 

1711
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,950
How do we know it's proportional?
>> Oh, the alpha is a hyperparameter that I

1712
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:40,960
>> Oh, the alpha is a hyperparameter that I
 

1713
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,790
>> Oh, the alpha is a hyperparameter that I
choose for how much I want to skew the

1714
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:42,800
choose for how much I want to skew the
 

1715
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,870
choose for how much I want to skew the
distribution.

1716
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:44,880
distribution.
 

1717
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,430
distribution.
Okay, so by making alpha bigger, I'm

1718
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:47,440
Okay, so by making alpha bigger, I'm
 

1719
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,750
Okay, so by making alpha bigger, I'm
skewing more to

1720
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:49,760
skewing more to
 

1721
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,030
skewing more to
moving more mass to the highest

1722
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,040
moving more mass to the highest
 

1723
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,270
moving more mass to the highest
probability sequences.

1724
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,280
probability sequences.
 

1725
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,190
probability sequences.
So in the paper they say that they tried

1726
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
So in the paper they say that they tried
 

1727
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,710
So in the paper they say that they tried
on different problems and alpha of four

1728
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:58,720
on different problems and alpha of four
 

1729
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,670
on different problems and alpha of four
seemed to work pretty well.

1730
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:01,680
seemed to work pretty well.
 

1731
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,430
seemed to work pretty well.
Okay, for for their uh in the paper.

1732
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,440
Okay, for for their uh in the paper.
 

1733
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,150
Okay, for for their uh in the paper.
Yeah.

1734
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,160
Yeah.
 

1735
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,390
Yeah.
>> So I think I'm a little confused because

1736
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:08,400
>> So I think I'm a little confused because
 

1737
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,630
>> So I think I'm a little confused because
earlier we were saying that you want to

1738
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:10,640
earlier we were saying that you want to
 

1739
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,230
earlier we were saying that you want to
sample from like the probability the

1740
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,240
sample from like the probability the
 

1741
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,750
sample from like the probability the
entire sequence.

1742
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:15,760
entire sequence.
 

1743
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,430
entire sequence.
>> Yes,

1744
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,440
>> Yes,
 

1745
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,870
>> Yes,
>> this this is the thing I want to sample

1746
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:18,880
>> this this is the thing I want to sample
 

1747
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,470
>> this this is the thing I want to sample
from. So, let me just mark it

1748
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
from. So, let me just mark it
 

1749
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:29,750
from. So, let me just mark it
explicitly.

1750
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:29,760

 

1751
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,349

>> I want to sample proportional that.

1752
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:33,359
>> I want to sample proportional that.
 

1753
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,349
>> I want to sample proportional that.
Yeah. So, over here it says you want to

1754
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:35,359
Yeah. So, over here it says you want to
 

1755
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,309
Yeah. So, over here it says you want to
sample proportional from that. But like

1756
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:38,319
sample proportional from that. But like
 

1757
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,069
sample proportional from that. But like
previously you were saying it's like you

1758
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:40,079
previously you were saying it's like you
 

1759
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,589
previously you were saying it's like you
sample from like the sum of like x of

1760
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:45,599
sample from like the sum of like x of
 

1761
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,069
sample from like the sum of like x of
>> Oh yeah great great okay so good let me

1762
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:48,079
>> Oh yeah great great okay so good let me
 

1763
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,069
>> Oh yeah great great okay so good let me
let me make make sure it's clear okay so

1764
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:50,079
let me make make sure it's clear okay so
 

1765
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,270
let me make make sure it's clear okay so
when I was talking about this

1766
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:51,280
when I was talking about this
 

1767
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,069
when I was talking about this
explanation I was just trying to set up

1768
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:54,079
explanation I was just trying to set up
 

1769
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,870
explanation I was just trying to set up
the story so you could see that if I

1770
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
the story so you could see that if I
 

1771
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,550
the story so you could see that if I
were to try to do it one token at a time

1772
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:00,560
were to try to do it one token at a time
 

1773
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,710
were to try to do it one token at a time
I would need to sample one token at a

1774
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:02,720
I would need to sample one token at a
 

1775
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,589
I would need to sample one token at a
time from this distribution

1776
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:05,599
time from this distribution
 

1777
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,270
time from this distribution
I'm not going to do it one token at a

1778
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:07,280
I'm not going to do it one token at a
 

1779
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,190
I'm not going to do it one token at a
time. I'm going to do an entire sequence

1780
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,200
time. I'm going to do an entire sequence
 

1781
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,470
time. I'm going to do an entire sequence
at a time.

1782
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:12,480
at a time.
 

1783
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,030
at a time.
Okay. So, that's the this is thing. If I

1784
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,040
Okay. So, that's the this is thing. If I
 

1785
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,470
Okay. So, that's the this is thing. If I
try to do it one token at a time, I'm

1786
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:16,480
try to do it one token at a time, I'm
 

1787
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,230
try to do it one token at a time, I'm
not going to be able to do it with low

1788
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,240
not going to be able to do it with low
 

1789
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,829
not going to be able to do it with low
temperature sampling. So, I'm going to

1790
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:19,839
temperature sampling. So, I'm going to
 

1791
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,550
temperature sampling. So, I'm going to
do something different.

1792
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:22,560
do something different.
 

1793
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,510
do something different.
Okay. Yeah. Question. Uh so the tention

1794
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,520
Okay. Yeah. Question. Uh so the tention
 

1795
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,510
Okay. Yeah. Question. Uh so the tention
here is that we want to sample from

1796
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:27,520
here is that we want to sample from
 

1797
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,390
here is that we want to sample from
something unnormalized distribution

1798
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:30,400
something unnormalized distribution
 

1799
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,790
something unnormalized distribution
that normalization factor is inractable.

1800
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:32,800
that normalization factor is inractable.
 

1801
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,829
that normalization factor is inractable.
>> Yes, we want to sample from an

1802
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
>> Yes, we want to sample from an
 

1803
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,430
>> Yes, we want to sample from an
unnormalized distribution uh but to

1804
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:37,440
unnormalized distribution uh but to
 

1805
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,349
unnormalized distribution uh but to
normalize it is intractable. So we have

1806
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:39,359
normalize it is intractable. So we have
 

1807
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,270
normalize it is intractable. So we have
to do something MCMC is one thing one

1808
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
to do something MCMC is one thing one
 

1809
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,390
to do something MCMC is one thing one
can do. This is the idea.

1810
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:44,400
can do. This is the idea.
 

1811
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,950
can do. This is the idea.
So what's the payoff of this idea? I

1812
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:46,960
So what's the payoff of this idea? I
 

1813
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,030
So what's the payoff of this idea? I
showed this last time but it's good to

1814
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,040
showed this last time but it's good to
 

1815
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,109
showed this last time but it's good to
see it.

1816
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:53,119

 

1817
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,910

So what they did was they said

1818
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:57,920
So what they did was they said
 

1819
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,950
So what they did was they said
I will just like play with the

1820
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:58,960
I will just like play with the
 

1821
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,030
I will just like play with the
hyperparameters a bit and set alpha

1822
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,040
hyperparameters a bit and set alpha
 

1823
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,510
hyperparameters a bit and set alpha
equal to four and how many MCMC steps

1824
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:03,520
equal to four and how many MCMC steps
 

1825
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,230
equal to four and how many MCMC steps
I'll do like 10

1826
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:06,240
I'll do like 10
 

1827
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,470
I'll do like 10
and see okay what happens so I'm going

1828
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:10,480
and see okay what happens so I'm going
 

1829
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,470
and see okay what happens so I'm going
to spend a lot more compute by doing

1830
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:12,480
to spend a lot more compute by doing
 

1831
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,710
to spend a lot more compute by doing
this right

1832
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:14,720
this right
 

1833
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,630
this right
um

1834
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:16,640
um
 

1835
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,990
um
but what happens so they have a

1836
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,000
but what happens so they have a
 

1837
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,270
but what happens so they have a
different benchmarks

1838
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,280
different benchmarks
 

1839
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,510
different benchmarks
So they say I have this math 500

1840
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:23,520
So they say I have this math 500
 

1841
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,950
So they say I have this math 500
benchmark and the Quen 2.5 math 7

1842
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:28,960
benchmark and the Quen 2.5 math 7
 

1843
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,230
benchmark and the Quen 2.5 math 7
billion parameter model which is the one

1844
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,240
billion parameter model which is the one
 

1845
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,550
billion parameter model which is the one
they played with. They said I just ask

1846
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:32,560
they played with. They said I just ask
 

1847
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,910
they played with. They said I just ask
it to solve it.

1848
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:35,920
it to solve it.
 

1849
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,390
it to solve it.
It's one shot and it gets to 50%.

1850
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:40,400
It's one shot and it gets to 50%.
 

1851
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,710
It's one shot and it gets to 50%.
Okay. Now I do this where I take higher

1852
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:44,720
Okay. Now I do this where I take higher
 

1853
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,510
Okay. Now I do this where I take higher
probability sequences. What happens? No

1854
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
probability sequences. What happens? No
 

1855
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,270
probability sequences. What happens? No
training. I just sample it. the higher

1856
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:49,280
training. I just sample it. the higher
 

1857
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,030
training. I just sample it. the higher
probability sequences using this

1858
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,040
probability sequences using this
 

1859
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,270
probability sequences using this
approach I get 75%.

1860
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,280
approach I get 75%.
 

1861
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,829
approach I get 75%.
So I move up in this benchmark quite

1862
00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:57,839
So I move up in this benchmark quite
 

1863
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,829
So I move up in this benchmark quite
substantially.

1864
00:44:59,829 --> 00:44:59,839
substantially.
 

1865
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,990
substantially.
If I do this other benchmark called

1866
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,000
If I do this other benchmark called
 

1867
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,589
If I do this other benchmark called
human eval this quen thing hits 33%. If

1868
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:05,599
human eval this quen thing hits 33%. If
 

1869
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:11,030
human eval this quen thing hits 33%. If
I do this I get to 57.

1870
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,040

 

1871
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,309

GPQA another one of these benchmarks

1872
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:14,319
GPQA another one of these benchmarks
 

1873
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,430
GPQA another one of these benchmarks
20 28 to 39

1874
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440
20 28 to 39
 

1875
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,950
20 28 to 39
no training just picking higher

1876
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:18,960
no training just picking higher
 

1877
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,309
no training just picking higher
probability sequences using this

1878
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:20,319
probability sequences using this
 

1879
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:22,069
probability sequences using this
technique

1880
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:22,079
technique
 

1881
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,710
technique
and they say this is pretty impressive

1882
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
and they say this is pretty impressive
 

1883
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,670
and they say this is pretty impressive
let's compare it to something else which

1884
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:27,680
let's compare it to something else which
 

1885
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,190
let's compare it to something else which
is an approach that I will mention var a

1886
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
is an approach that I will mention var a
 

1887
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,230
is an approach that I will mention var a
variation of in a moment so when in fall

1888
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:36,240
variation of in a moment so when in fall
 

1889
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,990
variation of in a moment so when in fall
2024 when deepseeek released their paper

1890
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,000
2024 when deepseeek released their paper
 

1891
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,710
2024 when deepseeek released their paper
um they had in it an approach for

1892
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:42,720
um they had in it an approach for
 

1893
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,109
um they had in it an approach for
fine-tuning for these kinds of problems.

1894
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:45,119
fine-tuning for these kinds of problems.
 

1895
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,790
fine-tuning for these kinds of problems.
So these kind of problems are special

1896
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:46,800
So these kind of problems are special
 

1897
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,190
So these kind of problems are special
because these kind of problems you have

1898
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:49,200
because these kind of problems you have
 

1899
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,030
because these kind of problems you have
a explicit right or wrong answer. You

1900
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,040
a explicit right or wrong answer. You
 

1901
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,790
a explicit right or wrong answer. You
know if it's right or wrong and you can

1902
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:54,800
know if it's right or wrong and you can
 

1903
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,510
know if it's right or wrong and you can
tell and so they say that if you have a

1904
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:57,520
tell and so they say that if you have a
 

1905
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,430
tell and so they say that if you have a
way of telling if the uh thing is right

1906
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,440
way of telling if the uh thing is right
 

1907
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,870
way of telling if the uh thing is right
or wrong you can fine-tune in a

1908
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:00,880
or wrong you can fine-tune in a
 

1909
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,870
or wrong you can fine-tune in a
particular way which I'll talk about and

1910
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:02,880
particular way which I'll talk about and
 

1911
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,670
particular way which I'll talk about and
I can target the math 500 data set. I

1912
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:05,680
I can target the math 500 data set. I
 

1913
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,109
I can target the math 500 data set. I
can say I want to target these kind of

1914
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:07,119
can say I want to target these kind of
 

1915
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,589
can say I want to target these kind of
problems and I'll do fine-tuning. If I

1916
00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:09,599
problems and I'll do fine-tuning. If I
 

1917
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:17,109
problems and I'll do fine-tuning. If I
do that using GRPO, it gets to 78.5.

1918
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:17,119

 

1919
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,030

And if I do that targeting the human

1920
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:19,040
And if I do that targeting the human
 

1921
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:26,630
And if I do that targeting the human
devel.

1922
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:26,640

 

1923
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,470

So what it's saying is that

1924
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,480
So what it's saying is that
 

1925
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,790
So what it's saying is that
these curves are the first order of

1926
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:34,800
these curves are the first order of
 

1927
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,510
these curves are the first order of
looking at kind of capturing most of

1928
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:37,520
looking at kind of capturing most of
 

1929
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,910
looking at kind of capturing most of
that gain which is the surprising result

1930
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:39,920
that gain which is the surprising result
 

1931
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,990
that gain which is the surprising result
in the paper.

1932
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:42,000
in the paper.
 

1933
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,309
in the paper.
Okay, that mo mo mo much of this gain is

1934
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:44,319
Okay, that mo mo mo much of this gain is
 

1935
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,630
Okay, that mo mo mo much of this gain is
just can be obtained by just sampling

1936
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:46,640
just can be obtained by just sampling
 

1937
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,750
just can be obtained by just sampling
and never doing any training at all.

1938
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
and never doing any training at all.
 

1939
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,670
and never doing any training at all.
And what they say is that this this

1940
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:51,680
And what they say is that this this
 

1941
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,349
And what they say is that this this
curve here says okay the reason anyone

1942
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:55,359
curve here says okay the reason anyone
 

1943
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,349
curve here says okay the reason anyone
trains a model to be better at reasoning

1944
00:46:57,349 --> 00:46:57,359
trains a model to be better at reasoning
 

1945
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,829
trains a model to be better at reasoning
on these kind of toy problems is because

1946
00:46:59,829 --> 00:46:59,839
on these kind of toy problems is because
 

1947
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,950
on these kind of toy problems is because
you hope and expect that this reasoning

1948
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
you hope and expect that this reasoning
 

1949
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,390
you hope and expect that this reasoning
ability will transfer to other problems

1950
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:06,400
ability will transfer to other problems
 

1951
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,230
ability will transfer to other problems
too besides the particular kinds of

1952
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:08,240
too besides the particular kinds of
 

1953
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,829
too besides the particular kinds of
problems that you're training on. Okay.

1954
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:11,839
problems that you're training on. Okay.
 

1955
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,510
problems that you're training on. Okay.
And what they're saying is if you look

1956
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:13,520
And what they're saying is if you look
 

1957
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,030
And what they're saying is if you look
at

1958
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,040
at
 

1959
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,270
at
things that are RL trained for this

1960
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:17,280
things that are RL trained for this
 

1961
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,829
things that are RL trained for this
other benchmark on these kinds of

1962
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:19,839
other benchmark on these kinds of
 

1963
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,230
other benchmark on these kinds of
things,

1964
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:22,240
things,
 

1965
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,430
things,
but then apply it to this different

1966
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:25,440
but then apply it to this different
 

1967
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,670
but then apply it to this different
benchmark. Yes, it scores an

1968
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:27,680
benchmark. Yes, it scores an
 

1969
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,390
benchmark. Yes, it scores an
improvement, but this also scores an

1970
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:30,400
improvement, but this also scores an
 

1971
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,630
improvement, but this also scores an
improvement.

1972
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:32,640
improvement.
 

1973
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,230
improvement.
And they claim this is improvement is

1974
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:34,240
And they claim this is improvement is
 

1975
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,349
And they claim this is improvement is
bigger than this. It's not significantly

1976
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:37,359
bigger than this. It's not significantly
 

1977
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,750
bigger than this. It's not significantly
bigger than this, but it's hard to tell.

1978
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:39,760
bigger than this, but it's hard to tell.
 

1979
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,069
bigger than this, but it's hard to tell.
Okay, so this is the excitement behind

1980
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:42,079
Okay, so this is the excitement behind
 

1981
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,309
Okay, so this is the excitement behind
um this paper

1982
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:44,319
um this paper
 

1983
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,150
um this paper
uh and why it's kind of useful to think

1984
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:46,160
uh and why it's kind of useful to think
 

1985
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,670
uh and why it's kind of useful to think
about. I think it's useful from a

1986
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:47,680
about. I think it's useful from a
 

1987
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,910
about. I think it's useful from a
teaching point of view because it first

1988
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:49,920
teaching point of view because it first
 

1989
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,150
teaching point of view because it first
tells you about this this role of

1990
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:52,160
tells you about this this role of
 

1991
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,309
tells you about this this role of
sampling. Uh second is it talks about

1992
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:56,319
sampling. Uh second is it talks about
 

1993
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,910
sampling. Uh second is it talks about
why from a markup chain perspective

1994
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
why from a markup chain perspective
 

1995
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,589
why from a markup chain perspective
thinking about ratios of probabilities

1996
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:01,599
thinking about ratios of probabilities
 

1997
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,589
thinking about ratios of probabilities
might be very interesting and important.

1998
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:03,599
might be very interesting and important.
 

1999
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,109
might be very interesting and important.
we will have ratios of probability will

2000
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:05,119
we will have ratios of probability will
 

2001
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,710
we will have ratios of probability will
come up again in the next thing we talk

2002
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,720
come up again in the next thing we talk
 

2003
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,630
come up again in the next thing we talk
about.

2004
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:08,640
about.
 

2005
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,910
about.
But at this point I wanted to

2006
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:11,920
But at this point I wanted to
 

2007
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,510
But at this point I wanted to
um

2008
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:13,520
um
 

2009
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,670
um
pause and give everyone like a minute to

2010
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:17,680
pause and give everyone like a minute to
 

2011
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,270
pause and give everyone like a minute to
talk to these these are literally the

2012
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
talk to these these are literally the
 

2013
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,270
talk to these these are literally the
plots from the paper to talk to your

2014
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,280
plots from the paper to talk to your
 

2015
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,630
plots from the paper to talk to your
neighbors and ask this question.

2016
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:24,640
neighbors and ask this question.
 

2017
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,470
neighbors and ask this question.
Is this so you're doing peer reviews

2018
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:26,480
Is this so you're doing peer reviews
 

2019
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,990
Is this so you're doing peer reviews
now? If you saw something like this,

2020
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:32,000
now? If you saw something like this,
 

2021
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,870
now? If you saw something like this,
is this enough to tell the story

2022
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:34,880
is this enough to tell the story
 

2023
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,069
is this enough to tell the story
properly or should there be some other

2024
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:38,079
properly or should there be some other
 

2025
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,430
properly or should there be some other
bars on this plot?

2026
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:41,440
bars on this plot?
 

2027
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,589
bars on this plot?
Okay, do you see what I'm saying? So

2028
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:43,599
Okay, do you see what I'm saying? So
 

2029
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,069
Okay, do you see what I'm saying? So
here they say, I want here's a baseline

2030
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:46,079
here they say, I want here's a baseline
 

2031
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,549
here they say, I want here's a baseline
of doing nothing. Here's the other

2032
00:48:48,549 --> 00:48:48,559
of doing nothing. Here's the other
 

2033
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,230
of doing nothing. Here's the other
approach that people talk a lot about um

2034
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:52,240
approach that people talk a lot about um
 

2035
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,549
approach that people talk a lot about um
GRPO a particular way of doing RL fine

2036
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:54,559
GRPO a particular way of doing RL fine
 

2037
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,750
GRPO a particular way of doing RL fine
tuning which we'll talk about in a

2038
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:55,760
tuning which we'll talk about in a
 

2039
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,470
tuning which we'll talk about in a
moment and here's us and they want to

2040
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480
moment and here's us and they want to
 

2041
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,309
moment and here's us and they want to
show that they're as good as this. So

2042
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:00,319
show that they're as good as this. So
 

2043
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,390
show that they're as good as this. So
now talk to your neighbors for a minute

2044
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:02,400
now talk to your neighbors for a minute
 

2045
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,470
now talk to your neighbors for a minute
and ask the question is there other

2046
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:04,480
and ask the question is there other
 

2047
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,750
and ask the question is there other
things that should also have been in

2048
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:05,760
things that should also have been in
 

2049
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,870
things that should also have been in
this paper.

2050
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:08,880
this paper.
 

2051
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:41,750
this paper.
>> Okay.

2052
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:41,760

 

2053
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,109

We know that

2054
00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:45,119

 

2055
00:49:45,119 --> 00:50:22,790

so nice. Foreign

2056
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:22,800

 

2057
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,950

Okay. So, I'm gonna bring everyone

2058
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:24,960
Okay. So, I'm gonna bring everyone
 

2059
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,230
Okay. So, I'm gonna bring everyone
together just for the interest of being

2060
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
together just for the interest of being
 

2061
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,430
together just for the interest of being

2063
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,390
able to talk more about more things
today. Um, okay. So, you've had a chance

2064
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:30,400
today. Um, okay. So, you've had a chance
 

2065
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,069
today. Um, okay. So, you've had a chance
to think about it. Uh, so who wants to

2066
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:34,079
to think about it. Uh, so who wants to
 

2067
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,670
to think about it. Uh, so who wants to
tell me uh some alternatives that should

2068
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:37,680
tell me uh some alternatives that should
 

2069
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,710
tell me uh some alternatives that should

>> Raise your hand. Yeah.

2072
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:41,599

>> Yeah. So the easiest one is

2076
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:49,839

 

2077
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:54,390

best of n

2080
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:00,720

Okay. So, yeah, very important because

2090
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:25,440
Okay. So, yeah, very important because
 

2091
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,030
Okay. So, yeah, very important because
this is selecting things that are higher

2092
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,040
this is selecting things that are higher
 

2093
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,870
this is selecting things that are higher
probability. It's a, you know,

2094
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:28,880
probability. It's a, you know,
 

2095
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,230
probability. It's a, you know,
sophisticated way of choosing things

2096
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:30,240
sophisticated way of choosing things
 

2097
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,270
sophisticated way of choosing things
that are higher probability. Um, best of

2098
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
that are higher probability. Um, best of
 

2099
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,589
that are higher probability. Um, best of
n is an easy way of uh of getting higher

2100
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:37,599
n is an easy way of uh of getting higher
 

2101
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,670
n is an easy way of uh of getting higher
probability. So we should see how we

2102
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:39,680
probability. So we should see how we
 

2103
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,190
probability. So we should see how we
should have been able to see for the

2104
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:41,200
should have been able to see for the
 

2105
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,270
should have been able to see for the
same amount of compute

2106
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:43,280
same amount of compute
 

2107
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,670
same amount of compute
right how much how does this do without

2108
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:47,680
right how much how does this do without
 

2109
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,549
right how much how does this do without
this it's kind of hard to tell from a

2110
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:50,559
this it's kind of hard to tell from a
 

2111
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,150
this it's kind of hard to tell from a

if this was also very competitive that's

2116
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:58,480
if this was also very competitive that's
 

2117
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,950
if this was also very competitive that's
also very interesting it's good to know

2118
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:00,960
also very interesting it's good to know
 

2119
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,710
also very interesting it's good to know
right if MCMC is better than this it

2120
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:04,720
right if MCMC is better than this it
 

2121
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,230
right if MCMC is better than this it
means that maybe there's something about

2122
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,240
means that maybe there's something about
 

2123
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,670
means that maybe there's something about
going to these lower probability things

2124
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:07,680
going to these lower probability things
 

2125
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,510
going to these lower probability things
that is useful and we would understand

2126
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:09,520
that is useful and we would understand
 

2127
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,829
that is useful and we would understand
how much that is. As it stands, we

2128
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:11,839
how much that is. As it stands, we
 

2129
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,069
how much that is. As it stands, we
cannot tell.

2130
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:14,079
cannot tell.
 

2131
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,870
cannot tell.
Okay, so this is really a very mis

2132
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:16,880
Okay, so this is really a very mis
 

2133
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,390
Okay, so this is really a very mis
important missing thing that should have

00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
important missing thing that should have
 

2135
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,309
important missing thing that should have
been in this paper. Um, yeah.

2136
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:24,319

describes all of this and the paper says
 

2143
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,710
describes all of this and the paper says
that for their optimized choices they're

that for their optimized choices they're
 

2145
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,510
that for their optimized choices they're
kind of burning uh something like factor

2146
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:41,520
kind of burning uh something like factor
 

2147
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,390
kind of burning uh something like factor
of nine cost uh of you know for

2148
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:46,400
of nine cost uh of you know for
 

2149
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,829
of nine cost uh of you know for
generating the response uh

2150
00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:49,839
generating the response uh
 

2151
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,630
generating the response uh
and these but the thing is that when you

2152
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:52,640
and these but the thing is that when you
 

2153
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,150
and these but the thing is that when you
do this kind of uh RL training you do

2154
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:56,160
do this kind of uh RL training you do
 

2155
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,510
do this kind of uh RL training you do
find the responses do get longer

2156
00:52:59,510 --> 00:52:59,520
find the responses do get longer
 

2157
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,589
find the responses do get longer
also. So that's also so they're getting

2158
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:01,599
also. So that's also so they're getting
 

2159
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,670
also. So that's also so they're getting
they're paying a factor of nine on the

2160
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:03,680
they're paying a factor of nine on the
 

2161
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,230
they're paying a factor of nine on the
longer responses to do this but there's

2162
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:06,240
longer responses to do this but there's
 

2163
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,390
longer responses to do this but there's
no training.

2164
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,400
no training.
 

2165
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,190
no training.
Okay. So from a what you should do in

2166
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:11,200
Okay. So from a what you should do in
 

2167
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,190
Okay. So from a what you should do in
practice situation of balancing compute

practice situation of balancing compute
 

2169

2187
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,990
question. So often times when you see
the

2188
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,000
the
 

2189
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,870

00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:34,880
uh performance on benchmarks they will
 

2191
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,950
uh performance on benchmarks they will
not respond with error bars because the

2192
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:36,960
not respond with error bars because the
 

2193
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,950
not respond with error bars because the
question about error bar is how do I

2194
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:38,960
question about error bar is how do I
 

2195
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,589
question about error bar is how do I
define what the randomness is uh for the

2196
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:41,599
define what the randomness is uh for the
 

2197
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,549
define what the randomness is uh for the
error bar. So when the thing you're

2198
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:44,559
error bar. So when the thing you're
 

2199
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,230
error bar. So when the thing you're
doing is gpo the error bars would come

2200
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,240
doing is gpo the error bars would come
 

2201
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,430
doing is gpo the error bars would come
there's two different sources of error

2202
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:49,440
there's two different sources of error
 

2203
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,790
there's two different sources of error
bars there's still some randomness in

2204
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
bars there's still some randomness in
 

2205
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,990
bars there's still some randomness in
the sampling of the of the trained

2206
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,000
the sampling of the of the trained
 

2207
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,230
the sampling of the of the trained
model. So I could try to see if I sample

2208
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,240
model. So I could try to see if I sample
 

2209
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,829
model. So I could try to see if I sample
from the train model again and again

2210
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:55,839
from the train model again and again
 

2211
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,829
from the train model again and again
what will I get? tends to happen there

2212
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:57,839
what will I get? tends to happen there
 

2213
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,349
what will I get? tends to happen there
is that the error bars are pretty tight.

2214
00:53:59,349 --> 00:53:59,359
is that the error bars are pretty tight.
 

2215
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,710
is that the error bars are pretty tight.
They are there but those that's

2216
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:00,720
They are there but those that's
 

2217
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,910
They are there but those that's
certainly one. Everyone understand what

2218
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
certainly one. Everyone understand what
 

2219
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,510
certainly one. Everyone understand what
I'm saying? So the error bars you get

2220
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:03,520
I'm saying? So the error bars you get
 

2221
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,109
I'm saying? So the error bars you get
from just doing a generation because

2222
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,119
from just doing a generation because
 

2223
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,510
from just doing a generation because
you're doing some randomness. The other

2224
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:07,520
you're doing some randomness. The other
 

2225
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,309
you're doing some randomness. The other
error bar is for training a model is

2226
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:10,319
error bar is for training a model is
 

2227
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,990
error bar is for training a model is
what you would have done had you trained

2228
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
what you would have done had you trained
 

2229
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,309
what you would have done had you trained
it again.

2230
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:14,319
it again.
 

2231
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,630
it again.
That's very expensive. And so people

2232
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:16,640
That's very expensive. And so people
 

2233
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,470
That's very expensive. And so people
often do not report error bars on

2234
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:18,480
often do not report error bars on
 

2235
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,150
often do not report error bars on
something that's really expensive to do

2236
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,160
something that's really expensive to do
 

2237
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,710
something that's really expensive to do
multiple trials of.

2238
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:22,720
multiple trials of.
 

2239
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,510
multiple trials of.
um for their approach

2240
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:25,520
um for their approach
 

2241
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,349
um for their approach
uh the error bars would be multiple

2242
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:27,359
uh the error bars would be multiple
 

2243
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,069
uh the error bars would be multiple
generations error bars and the odds are

2244
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:30,079
generations error bars and the odds are
 

2245
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,309
generations error bars and the odds are
they'd be pretty tight. Um they would

2246
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,319
they'd be pretty tight. Um they would
 

2247
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,589
they'd be pretty tight. Um they would
not be that big but yeah they could have

2248
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:33,599
not be that big but yeah they could have
 

2249
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,390
not be that big but yeah they could have
reported that. So these error bars cost

2250
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:36,400
reported that. So these error bars cost
 

2251
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,109
reported that. So these error bars cost
compute to generate almost always. And

2252
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:39,119
compute to generate almost always. And
 

2253
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,630
compute to generate almost always. And
so

2254
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:40,640
so
 

2255
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,030
so
yeah

2256
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,040

under the base model was something that

2278
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
under the base model was something that
 

2279
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,150
under the base model was something that
people had observed from RL models

2280
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,160
people had observed from RL models
 

2281
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,829
people had observed from RL models
before. What they're saying is we should

2282
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:15,839
before. What they're saying is we should
 

2283
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,430
before. What they're saying is we should
look into this why it is the intuition

2284
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:17,440
look into this why it is the intuition
 

2285
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,870
look into this why it is the intuition
is what I described that if thinking

2286
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:20,880
is what I described that if thinking
 

2287
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,309
is what I described that if thinking
traces go the wrong way then they will

2288
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:24,319
traces go the wrong way then they will
 

2289
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,589
traces go the wrong way then they will
get stuck or will have branching points

2290
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:27,599
get stuck or will have branching points
 

2291
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,670
get stuck or will have branching points
that have very high probability on them.

2292
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:29,680
that have very high probability on them.
 

2293
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,510
that have very high probability on them.
So the paper describes this it called

2294
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:31,520
So the paper describes this it called
 

2295
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,630
So the paper describes this it called
there's a concept people talk about

2296
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:32,640
there's a concept people talk about
 

2297
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,910
there's a concept people talk about
pivotal tokens of tokens that you really

2298
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:35,920
pivotal tokens of tokens that you really
 

2299
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,910
pivotal tokens of tokens that you really
have to make the right choice on and if

2300
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920
have to make the right choice on and if
 

2301
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,870
have to make the right choice on and if
you make the wrong choice you go bad. So

2302
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:40,880
you make the wrong choice you go bad. So
 

2303
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,470
you make the wrong choice you go bad. So
this is empirical observations people

2304
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:42,480
this is empirical observations people
 

2305
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,790
this is empirical observations people
have and so the idea is that the pivotal

2306
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:44,800
have and so the idea is that the pivotal
 

2307
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,190
have and so the idea is that the pivotal
choke token choice that you have to make

2308
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:47,200
choke token choice that you have to make
 

2309
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,270
choke token choice that you have to make
you have to get it right to have the

2310
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
you have to get it right to have the
 

2311
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,789
you have to get it right to have the
generation turnout correct. And so

2312
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:52,799
generation turnout correct. And so
 

2313
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,510
generation turnout correct. And so
that's one thing that it's explaining.

2314
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
that's one thing that it's explaining.
 

2315
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,230
that's one thing that it's explaining.
Now, in a way,

2316
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
Now, in a way,
 

2317
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,990
Now, in a way,
there's there's a subtlety here that I

2318
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:00,000
there's there's a subtlety here that I
 

2319
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,510
there's there's a subtlety here that I
want to talk about in a moment, but I

2320
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520

want to make sure people understand like
 

2323
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,150
want to make sure people understand like
what the alternatives are. If anyone's

what the alternatives are. If anyone's
other alternatives that your group

00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:05,280
other alternatives that your group
 

2327
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,789
other alternatives that your group
discussed, I want to make sure this one

2328
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:06,799
discussed, I want to make sure this one
 

2329
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:07,910
discussed, I want to make sure this one
got talked about, but if there's others

2330
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:07,920
got talked about, but if there's others
 

2331
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,270
got talked about, but if there's others
that people have, then I want to include

2332
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:09,280
that people have, then I want to include
 

2333
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,950
that people have, then I want to include
them, too.

2334
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:10,960
them, too.
 

2335
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,589

>> Yeah,

>> Yeah,
 

2337
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,990

2343
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,270
optimization uh for the problem. Um I
believe for

2344
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:23,280
believe for
 

2345
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,910
believe for
these kinds of problems it doesn't help

2346
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:25,920
these kinds of problems it doesn't help
 

2347
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,589
these kinds of problems it doesn't help
much but I would like love to know

2348
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:27,599
much but I would like love to know
 

2349
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,349
much but I would like love to know
exactly how much it does help. So it's a

2350
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:29,359
exactly how much it does help. So it's a
 

2351
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:33,510
exactly how much it does help. So it's a
good good point

2352
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:33,520

 

2353
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:42,630

to prime two

2354
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:42,640

 

2355
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,630

because prompt optimization can also be

2356
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:44,640
because prompt optimization can also be
 

2357
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,150
because prompt optimization can also be
thought of as a way of eliciting the

2358
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:46,160
thought of as a way of eliciting the
 

2359
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,510
thought of as a way of eliciting the
capabilities that are actually in the

2360
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:47,520
capabilities that are actually in the
 

2361
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,829
capabilities that are actually in the
model. So that's a good point.

2362
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:49,839
model. So that's a good point.
 

2363
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,750
model. So that's a good point.
Um I suspect it won't have done much in

00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:51,760
Um I suspect it won't have done much in
 

2365
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,190
Um I suspect it won't have done much in
this case but I don't know I don't know

00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:12,000
if you're trying to train it on a task
 

2381
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,990
if you're trying to train it on a task
like you said to do or something like

2382
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,000
like you said to do or something like
 

2383
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,910
like you said to do or something like
that more like motor skills with the

2384
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:19,920
that more like motor skills with the
 

2385
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,349
that more like motor skills with the
Excellent point. So this comes back to

2386
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:21,359
Excellent point. So this comes back to
 

2387
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,789
Excellent point. So this comes back to
what I was talking about before. Maybe I

2388
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:22,799
what I was talking about before. Maybe I
 

2389
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,470
what I was talking about before. Maybe I
didn't make it clear. So I mentioned

2390
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:24,480
didn't make it clear. So I mentioned
 

2391
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,510
didn't make it clear. So I mentioned
this last time that the way that these

2392
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:27,520
this last time that the way that these
 

2393
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,190
this last time that the way that these
training things work is you pre-train

2394
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:29,200
training things work is you pre-train
 

2395
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,789
training things work is you pre-train
the model on a large set of things. And

2396
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:30,799
the model on a large set of things. And
 

2397
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,309
the model on a large set of things. And
then what you do is you mix in more of

2398
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:34,319
then what you do is you mix in more of
 

2399
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,390
then what you do is you mix in more of
the kinds of things you actually care

2400
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:36,400
the kinds of things you actually care
 

2401
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,109
the kinds of things you actually care
about into the pre-training mix itself.

2402
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:39,119
about into the pre-training mix itself.
 

2403
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,470
about into the pre-training mix itself.
Then what you do is you mix you do this

2404
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:42,480
Then what you do is you mix you do this
 

2405
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,789
Then what you do is you mix you do this
kind of thing where you say, "Okay, now

2406
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:44,799
kind of thing where you say, "Okay, now
 

2407
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,789
kind of thing where you say, "Okay, now
I'm also going to ask it questions. So

2408
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:46,799
I'm also going to ask it questions. So
 

2409
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,150
I'm also going to ask it questions. So
I'm going to have this separation where

2410
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:48,160
I'm going to have this separation where
 

2411
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,829
I'm going to have this separation where
I I supervise only on the responses and

2412
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:51,839
I I supervise only on the responses and
 

2413
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,470
I I supervise only on the responses and
not on the questions part. This is part

2414
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,480
not on the questions part. This is part
 

2415
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,829
not on the questions part. This is part
of the standard um training before you

2416
00:57:57,829 --> 00:57:57,839
of the standard um training before you
 

2417
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:02,069
of the standard um training before you
do any RL training on a model. And so

2418
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:02,079
do any RL training on a model. And so
 

2419
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,030
do any RL training on a model. And so
it's true Quen math was trained with

2420
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:05,040
it's true Quen math was trained with
 

2421
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,829
it's true Quen math was trained with
this kind of mix that was math heavy and

2422
00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:07,839
this kind of mix that was math heavy and
 

2423
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,150
this kind of mix that was math heavy and
aiming at math type of things and aiming

2424
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:10,160
aiming at math type of things and aiming
 

2425
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,549
aiming at math type of things and aiming
at reasoning about math sort of in the

2426
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:12,559
at reasoning about math sort of in the
 

2427
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,470
at reasoning about math sort of in the
mix to begin with and code. So it's code

2428
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:14,480
mix to begin with and code. So it's code
 

2429
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,870
mix to begin with and code. So it's code
and math. So the code and math these

2430
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:16,880
and math. So the code and math these
 

2431
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,470
and math. So the code and math these
things are trained on is much more than

2432
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:18,480
things are trained on is much more than
 

2433
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,710
things are trained on is much more than
the proportion of code and math on the

2434
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:20,720
the proportion of code and math on the
 

2435
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,870
the proportion of code and math on the
internet. Like most of the internet is

2436
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:22,880
internet. Like most of the internet is
 

2437
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,829
internet. Like most of the internet is
not coded math but a lot of their

2438
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:25,839
not coded math but a lot of their
 

2439
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,589
not coded math but a lot of their
training mix is coded math. So that's

2440
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:27,599
training mix is coded math. So that's
 

2441
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,870
training mix is coded math. So that's
already present. Um yes and that also

2442
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
already present. Um yes and that also
 

2443
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,950
already present. Um yes and that also
comes from that's why this this question

2444
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:32,960
comes from that's why this this question
 

2445
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,349
comes from that's why this this question
is in the field of how much of the

2446
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:35,359
is in the field of how much of the
 

2447
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:38,470
is in the field of how much of the
capability is actually already present

2448
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:38,480
capability is actually already present
 

2449
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,870
capability is actually already present
in the base model and what needs to be

2450
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:40,880
in the base model and what needs to be
 

2451
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,470
in the base model and what needs to be
unlocked sort of by RL training. But I

2452
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:44,480
unlocked sort of by RL training. But I
 

2453
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,069
unlocked sort of by RL training. But I
wanted to there's there's more here I

2454
00:58:46,069 --> 00:58:46,079
wanted to there's there's more here I
 

2455
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,150
wanted to there's there's more here I
wanted to comment on before I move on.

2456
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:48,160
wanted to comment on before I move on.
 

2457
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,510
wanted to comment on before I move on.
Yeah.

2458
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:49,520
Yeah.
 

2459
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,630
Yeah.
>> Yeah.

2460
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:50,640
>> Yeah.
 

2461
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,230
>> Yeah.
>> So I was thinking like okay if you get

2462
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:54,240
>> So I was thinking like okay if you get
 

2463
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,710
>> So I was thinking like okay if you get
better

2464
00:58:58,710 --> 00:58:58,720

 

2465
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,589

but like what happens if you use both

2466
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:01,599
but like what happens if you use both
 

2467
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:07,270
but like what happens if you use both
kind

2468
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:07,280

 

2469
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:07,829

of

2470
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:07,839
of
 

2471
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,069
of
>> Yeah. Excellent question. And so the

2472
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:10,079
>> Yeah. Excellent question. And so the
 

2473
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,670
>> Yeah. Excellent question. And so the
paper talks about this. So what the

2474
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:13,680
paper talks about this. So what the
 

2475
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,030
paper talks about this. So what the
paper talks about is that if you do

2476
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:17,040
paper talks about is that if you do
 

2477
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,789
paper talks about is that if you do
people have observed this empirically if

2478
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:18,799
people have observed this empirically if
 

2479
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,589
people have observed this empirically if
you do RL tuning on a model and then you

2480
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:21,599
you do RL tuning on a model and then you
 

2481
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:26,309
you do RL tuning on a model and then you
do on top of that best event generation.

2482
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:26,319
do on top of that best event generation.
 

2483
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,870
do on top of that best event generation.
Okay so I RL tune it first and then I

2484
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:28,880
Okay so I RL tune it first and then I
 

2485
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,589
Okay so I RL tune it first and then I
say now pick the best event. The gains

2486
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:31,599
say now pick the best event. The gains
 

2487
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,510
say now pick the best event. The gains
don't compound

2488
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:33,520
don't compound
 

2489
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,670
don't compound
the same way as they would for best of

2490
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:35,680
the same way as they would for best of
 

2491
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,910
the same way as they would for best of
end generally. And what they claim in

2492
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:37,920
end generally. And what they claim in
 

2493
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,470
end generally. And what they claim in
this paper is that this approach

2494
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:40,480
this paper is that this approach
 

2495
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,109
this paper is that this approach
actually does get further compounding

2496
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:43,119
actually does get further compounding
 

2497
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,549
actually does get further compounding
gains of best event in a way that RL

2498
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:46,559
gains of best event in a way that RL
 

2499
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,549
gains of best event in a way that RL
tuning doesn't.

2500
00:59:48,549 --> 00:59:48,559
tuning doesn't.
 

2501
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:49,910
tuning doesn't.
But they don't have a comparison here

2502
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:49,920
But they don't have a comparison here
 

2503
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,829
But they don't have a comparison here
with straight best event on the base.

2504
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:51,839
with straight best event on the base.
 

2505
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,589
with straight best event on the base.
Yeah.

2506
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:53,599
Yeah.
 

2507
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,349
Yeah.
>> Does that mean that RL is performing one

collapse or causing collapse? So the

2510
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:58,400
collapse or causing collapse? So the
 

2511
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,270
collapse or causing collapse? So the
perspective is that uh the people worry

2512
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:01,280
perspective is that uh the people worry
 

2513
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,150
perspective is that uh the people worry
about in RL that whether or not by

2514
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,160
about in RL that whether or not by
 

2515
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,630
about in RL that whether or not by
making it favor certain kinds of things

2516
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:06,640
making it favor certain kinds of things
 

2517
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,109
making it favor certain kinds of things
you an experience as all fine-tuning

2518
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:09,119
you an experience as all fine-tuning
 

2519
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,670
you an experience as all fine-tuning
methods do uh forgetting which we talked

2520
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:11,680
methods do uh forgetting which we talked
 

2521
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,150
methods do uh forgetting which we talked
about in the class. So are we forgetting

2522
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,160
about in the class. So are we forgetting
 

2523
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,069
about in the class. So are we forgetting
important things by doing the RL

2524
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:16,079
important things by doing the RL
 

2525
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,150
important things by doing the RL
training as one would always fear in any

2526
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,160
training as one would always fear in any
 

2527
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,150
training as one would always fear in any
fine tune and so yes people worry about

2528
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:20,160
fine tune and so yes people worry about
 

2529
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,230
fine tune and so yes people worry about
that and they also worry that it's uh

2530
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
that and they also worry that it's uh
 

2531
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,030
that and they also worry that it's uh
yeah it's basically favoring more likely

2532
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,040
yeah it's basically favoring more likely
 

2533
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,549
yeah it's basically favoring more likely
things in such a way that might block

2534
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:26,559

end for example or any method that can
 

2587
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,230
end for example or any method that can
give you samples that are more likely to

01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:14,240
give you samples that are more likely to
 

2589
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,870
give you samples that are more likely to
be correct you can then use these

2590
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:16,880
be correct you can then use these
 

2591
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,549
be correct you can then use these
samples that are more likely to be

2592
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:18,559
samples that are more likely to be
 

2593
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,270
samples that are more likely to be
correct in your process of fine-tuning a

2594
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:21,280
correct in your process of fine-tuning a
 

2595
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,829
correct in your process of fine-tuning a
model using another approach like RL. So

2596
01:01:23,829 --> 01:01:23,839
model using another approach like RL. So
 

2597
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,190
model using another approach like RL. So
we'll talk about this in a bit when I

2598
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:25,200
we'll talk about this in a bit when I
 

2599
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,950
we'll talk about this in a bit when I
talk about like what you need to make to

2600
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:26,960
talk about like what you need to make to
 

2601
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,990
talk about like what you need to make to
make RL approaches work. So definitely

2602
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,000
make RL approaches work. So definitely
 

2603
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,270
make RL approaches work. So definitely
this compounds in fact versions of this

2604
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:33,280
this compounds in fact versions of this
 

2605
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,150
this compounds in fact versions of this
are being used even um I think in llama

2606
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:36,160
are being used even um I think in llama
 

2607
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:42,390
are being used even um I think in llama
2's training where they talked about how

2608
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:42,400
2's training where they talked about how
 

2609
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:49,750
2's training where they talked about how
so you go back a bit

2610
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:49,760

 

2611
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,990

remember this approach we mentioned

2612
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:54,000
remember this approach we mentioned
 

2613
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,630
remember this approach we mentioned
about training a reward model to grade

2614
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,640
about training a reward model to grade
 

2615
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,430
about training a reward model to grade
so if I train a reward model to grade. I

2616
01:01:59,430 --> 01:01:59,440
so if I train a reward model to grade. I
 

2617
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,390
so if I train a reward model to grade. I
can generate better responses by simply

2618
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,400
can generate better responses by simply
 

2619
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,309
can generate better responses by simply
taking my model, doing a thousand

2620
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:04,319
taking my model, doing a thousand
 

2621
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,109
taking my model, doing a thousand
generations under my model, ranking them

2622
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:07,119
generations under my model, ranking them
 

2623
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,190
generations under my model, ranking them
under the reward model and giving the

2624
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:09,200
under the reward model and giving the
 

2625
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,910
under the reward model and giving the
best one.

2626
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:11,920
best one.
 

2627
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,789
best one.
So, uh you can then use these enhanced

2628
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:16,799
So, uh you can then use these enhanced
 

2629
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,349
So, uh you can then use these enhanced
mod enhanced uh responses to then do

2630
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:19,359
mod enhanced uh responses to then do
 

2631
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,750
mod enhanced uh responses to then do
training to make the model kind of get

2632
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:21,760
training to make the model kind of get
 

2633
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,670
training to make the model kind of get
better and better. So if you think about

2634
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:23,680
better and better. So if you think about
 

2635
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,349
better and better. So if you think about
it, what this kind of training that's

2636
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:25,359
it, what this kind of training that's
 

2637
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:29,430
it, what this kind of training that's
being described right now is is it says

2638
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,440
being described right now is is it says
 

2639
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,109
being described right now is is it says
I have some way of getting responses

2640
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:31,119
I have some way of getting responses
 

2641
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,549
I have some way of getting responses
that I think of as being better

2642
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:32,559
that I think of as being better
 

2643
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,589
that I think of as being better
responses. Um they're more likely to be

2644
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:35,599
responses. Um they're more likely to be
 

2645
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,349
responses. Um they're more likely to be
correct. Can I make the base model

2646
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:37,359
correct. Can I make the base model
 

2647
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:40,950
correct. Can I make the base model
itself generate those more likely?

2648
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:40,960
itself generate those more likely?
 

2649
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,829
itself generate those more likely?
Do you see that?

2650
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:43,839
Do you see that?
 

2651
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:46,549
Do you see that?
So that is a theme that people follow.

2652
01:02:46,549 --> 01:02:46,559
So that is a theme that people follow.
 

2653
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,270
So that is a theme that people follow.
Now the interesting thing about it is

2654
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,280
Now the interesting thing about it is
 

2655
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,150
Now the interesting thing about it is
that

2656
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,160
that
 

2657
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,270
that
actually this sampling approach in a way

2658
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:55,280
actually this sampling approach in a way
 

2659
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,309
actually this sampling approach in a way
or like beam search for example beam

2660
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,319
or like beam search for example beam
 

2661
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,870
or like beam search for example beam
search makes it obvious that it's doing

2662
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:00,880
search makes it obvious that it's doing
 

2663
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,549
search makes it obvious that it's doing
computation but it's also doing

2664
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:02,559
computation but it's also doing
 

2665
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,309
computation but it's also doing
computation that's effectively doing

2666
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:04,319
computation that's effectively doing
 

2667
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,470
computation that's effectively doing
look ahead

2668
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:06,480
look ahead
 

2669
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,510
look ahead
right before it commits it looks ahead

2670
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:09,520
right before it commits it looks ahead
 

2671
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,349
right before it commits it looks ahead
now you could say that oh yeah you know

2672
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:13,359
now you could say that oh yeah you know
 

2673
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,109
now you could say that oh yeah you know
I have a so think about chess or some

2674
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:15,119
I have a so think about chess or some
 

2675
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,029
I have a so think about chess or some
other game I have a way of scoring

2676
01:03:17,029 --> 01:03:17,039
other game I have a way of scoring
 

2677
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:19,990
other game I have a way of scoring
positions, right? And if I do the

2678
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:20,000
positions, right? And if I do the
 

2679
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,829
positions, right? And if I do the
scoring of positions together with look

2680
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
scoring of positions together with look
 

2681
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:27,109
scoring of positions together with look
ahead, right, then I can do very well.

2682
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:27,119
ahead, right, then I can do very well.
 

2683
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,870
ahead, right, then I can do very well.
But that does that mean the scoring of

2684
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,880
But that does that mean the scoring of
 

2685
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,230
But that does that mean the scoring of
positions by themselves are

2686
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:32,240
positions by themselves are
 

2687
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,029
positions by themselves are
so powerful? Not really. You need the

2688
01:03:35,029 --> 01:03:35,039
so powerful? Not really. You need the
 

2689
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,549
so powerful? Not really. You need the
combination,

2690
01:03:36,549 --> 01:03:36,559
combination,
 

2691
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,589
combination,
right? And so when one talks about what

2692
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:39,599
right? And so when one talks about what
 

2693
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,430
right? And so when one talks about what
RL training is doing or what other

2694
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:41,440
RL training is doing or what other
 

2695
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,150
RL training is doing or what other
trainings are doing, even SFTTS on these

2696
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,160
trainings are doing, even SFTTS on these
 

2697
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,309
trainings are doing, even SFTTS on these
kinds of things, you can think of it as

2698
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:46,319
kinds of things, you can think of it as
 

2699
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,390
kinds of things, you can think of it as
trying to get the model to actually

2700
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:48,400
trying to get the model to actually
 

2701
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,309
trying to get the model to actually
learn implicitly to look ahead

2702
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319
learn implicitly to look ahead
 

2703
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,549
learn implicitly to look ahead
and see, okay, wait, I don't want to

2704
01:03:54,549 --> 01:03:54,559
and see, okay, wait, I don't want to
 

2705
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,950
and see, okay, wait, I don't want to
choose this pivotal token the wrong way

2706
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:56,960
choose this pivotal token the wrong way
 

2707
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,670
choose this pivotal token the wrong way
because it's going to screw me up later.

2708
01:03:59,670 --> 01:03:59,680
because it's going to screw me up later.
 

2709
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,349
because it's going to screw me up later.
So I'm going to make the correct choice

2710
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:01,359
So I'm going to make the correct choice
 

2711
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,390
So I'm going to make the correct choice
and not the incorrect choice. So it is

2712
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:04,400
and not the incorrect choice. So it is
 

2713
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,910
and not the incorrect choice. So it is
actually adding a capability just

2714
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:05,920
actually adding a capability just
 

2715
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,270
actually adding a capability just
because the model could generate with

2716
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:07,280
because the model could generate with
 

2717
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,630
because the model could generate with
best of end something doesn't mean that

2718
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:08,640
best of end something doesn't mean that
 

2719
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,270
best of end something doesn't mean that
when you run it once to do to do do as

2720
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:11,280
when you run it once to do to do do as
 

2721
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,789
when you run it once to do to do do as
well of best of n in one shot requires

2722
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:14,799
well of best of n in one shot requires
 

2723
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,510
well of best of n in one shot requires
more look ahead. Okay. So there is

2724
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
more look ahead. Okay. So there is
 

2725
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,670
more look ahead. Okay. So there is
something that's being u that can be

2726
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:19,680
something that's being u that can be
 

2727
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,069
something that's being u that can be
added. Yeah. Um there's another question

2728
01:04:22,069 --> 01:04:22,079
added. Yeah. Um there's another question
 

2729
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:23,670
added. Yeah. Um there's another question
first. Yeah.

2730
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:23,680
first. Yeah.
 

2731
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,789
first. Yeah.
>> So this idea I think is very similar to

2732
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:28,799
>> So this idea I think is very similar to
 

2733
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:34,150
>> So this idea I think is very similar to
predictive control.

2734
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:34,160

 

2735
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,630

just use predictive control and PC

2736
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:36,640
just use predictive control and PC
 

2737
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,470
just use predictive control and PC
detect that

2738
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:38,480
detect that
 

2739
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,630
detect that
>> yeah so uh the connections between RL

2740
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:40,640
>> yeah so uh the connections between RL
 

2741
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,750
>> yeah so uh the connections between RL
and control is very very close they

2742
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:43,760
and control is very very close they
 

2743
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,589
and control is very very close they
actually all the RL techniques grow out

2744
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:45,599
actually all the RL techniques grow out
 

2745
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,309
actually all the RL techniques grow out
of control so in fact the class that

2746
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:48,319
of control so in fact the class that
 

2747
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,950
of control so in fact the class that
meets immediately before this one what

2748
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:50,960
meets immediately before this one what
 

2749
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,870
meets immediately before this one what
they're doing is actually MPC and RL uh

2750
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,880
they're doing is actually MPC and RL uh
 

2751
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,230
they're doing is actually MPC and RL uh
together at the end of it's a main

2752
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:56,240
together at the end of it's a main
 

2753
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,349
together at the end of it's a main
controls class so these are these are

2754
01:04:59,349 --> 01:04:59,359
controls class so these are these are
 

2755
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,630
controls class so these are these are
one field they're not separate

2756
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
one field they're not separate
 

2757
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,630
one field they're not separate
Um, there's a reason why a lot of Ral

2758
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:04,640
Um, there's a reason why a lot of Ral
 

2759
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,230
Um, there's a reason why a lot of Ral
techniques come out of labs working in

2760
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,240
techniques come out of labs working in
 

2761
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,829
techniques come out of labs working in
robotics,

2762
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:07,839
robotics,
 

2763
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,750
robotics,
right? It's just historically the way it

2764
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:09,760
right? It's just historically the way it
 

2765
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,910
right? It's just historically the way it
is.

2766
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:11,920
is.
 

2767
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,950
is.
Okay. So,

2768
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:14,960
Okay. So,
 

2769
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,069
Okay. So,
um, yeah. So, I've talked about

2770
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:16,079
um, yeah. So, I've talked about
 

2771
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,190
um, yeah. So, I've talked about
everything I want to talk about here. I

2772
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:17,200
everything I want to talk about here. I
 

2773
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:21,190
everything I want to talk about here. I
want to move on and talk about RLVR.

2774
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,200
want to move on and talk about RLVR.
 

2775
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,029
want to move on and talk about RLVR.
Okay. So

2776
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:25,039

 

2777
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,870

RLDVR is in my opinion easier way to get

2778
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:28,880
RLDVR is in my opinion easier way to get
 

2779
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,789
RLDVR is in my opinion easier way to get
into understanding what's going on here

2780
01:05:30,789 --> 01:05:30,799
into understanding what's going on here
 

2781
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:35,349
into understanding what's going on here
than what's called RHF. So as distinct

2782
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:35,359
than what's called RHF. So as distinct
 

2783
01:05:35,359 --> 01:06:00,789
than what's called RHF. So as distinct
from mark this down. Oops.

2784
01:06:00,789 --> 01:06:00,799

 

2785
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:03,190

So the very important critical paper I

2786
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,200
So the very important critical paper I
 

2787
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,109
So the very important critical paper I
mentioned before on instruct GPT was

2788
01:06:05,109 --> 01:06:05,119
mentioned before on instruct GPT was
 

2789
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,109
mentioned before on instruct GPT was
about RLHF which is how can you use

2790
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:07,119
about RLHF which is how can you use
 

2791
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:10,630
about RLHF which is how can you use
human feedback to make models better. Um

2792
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:10,640
human feedback to make models better. Um
 

2793
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,549
human feedback to make models better. Um
it's actually I think harder to

2794
01:06:12,549 --> 01:06:12,559
it's actually I think harder to
 

2795
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:15,109
it's actually I think harder to
understand if you start with RLHF. It's

2796
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:15,119
understand if you start with RLHF. It's
 

2797
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,109
understand if you start with RLHF. It's
easier to understand with RLVR as the

2798
01:06:17,109 --> 01:06:17,119
easier to understand with RLVR as the
 

2799
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:19,190
easier to understand with RLVR as the
base. So, I'm I'm just going to use RLVR

2800
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:19,200
base. So, I'm I'm just going to use RLVR
 

2801
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,029
base. So, I'm I'm just going to use RLVR
as the base and then you can we'll think

2802
01:06:21,029 --> 01:06:21,039
as the base and then you can we'll think
 

2803
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:23,670
as the base and then you can we'll think
about how RLHF fits in on top of as a

2804
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:23,680
about how RLHF fits in on top of as a
 

2805
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,549
about how RLHF fits in on top of as a
modification of RLVR.

2806
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:26,559
modification of RLVR.
 

2807
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,630
modification of RLVR.
So, what is RLVR? Um, verifiable rewards

2808
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:30,640
So, what is RLVR? Um, verifiable rewards
 

2809
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,510
So, what is RLVR? Um, verifiable rewards
just means that you have an automated

2810
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:33,520
just means that you have an automated
 

2811
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,190
just means that you have an automated
way of scoring and saying this is right

2812
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:37,200
way of scoring and saying this is right
 

2813
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,789
way of scoring and saying this is right
or this is wrong. You can verify.

2814
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:40,799
or this is wrong. You can verify.
 

2815
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:43,510
or this is wrong. You can verify.
So somehow you generate a response

2816
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:43,520
So somehow you generate a response
 

2817
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,589
So somehow you generate a response
something and there's a way of telling

2818
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
something and there's a way of telling
 

2819
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,470
something and there's a way of telling
if the answer is right.

2820
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:48,480
if the answer is right.
 

2821
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,349
if the answer is right.
Okay, that's the on your training data.

2822
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:51,359
Okay, that's the on your training data.
 

2823
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:52,870
Okay, that's the on your training data.
If you can do that, that's called

2824
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:52,880
If you can do that, that's called
 

2825
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,029
If you can do that, that's called
verifiable rewards. So one easy way is

2826
01:06:55,029 --> 01:06:55,039
verifiable rewards. So one easy way is
 

2827
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:56,710
verifiable rewards. So one easy way is
math problem where you have a math

2828
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:56,720
math problem where you have a math
 

2829
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,430
math problem where you have a math
problem and there's a boxed answer and

2830
01:06:59,430 --> 01:06:59,440
problem and there's a boxed answer and
 

2831
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,230
problem and there's a boxed answer and
you know the right answer for that box.

2832
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:02,240
you know the right answer for that box.
 

2833
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:05,910
you know the right answer for that box.
So you can say okay generate however you

2834
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:05,920
So you can say okay generate however you
 

2835
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,750
So you can say okay generate however you
want. Is the answer right or is it

2836
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:07,760
want. Is the answer right or is it
 

2837
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,589
want. Is the answer right or is it
wrong? You can just check the answer in

2838
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:09,599
wrong? You can just check the answer in
 

2839
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,270
wrong? You can just check the answer in
the box. So another way of thinking

2840
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:11,280
the box. So another way of thinking
 

2841
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,029
the box. So another way of thinking
about verifiable rewards is verifiable

2842
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:13,039
about verifiable rewards is verifiable
 

2843
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:14,309
about verifiable rewards is verifiable
rewards is something which can be

2844
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:14,319
rewards is something which can be
 

2845
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:20,150
rewards is something which can be
autograded using code.

2846
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:20,160

 

2847
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,589

So there was this very interesting paper

2848
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:23,599
So there was this very interesting paper
 

2849
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,230
So there was this very interesting paper
that I would recommend called the art of

2850
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:26,240
that I would recommend called the art of
 

2851
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,069
that I would recommend called the art of
scaling reinforcement learning compute

2852
01:07:28,069 --> 01:07:28,079
scaling reinforcement learning compute
 

2853
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:29,750
scaling reinforcement learning compute
for LLMs. There's lots of stuff in this

2854
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:29,760
for LLMs. There's lots of stuff in this
 

2855
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,910
for LLMs. There's lots of stuff in this
paper that came out October 15th

2856
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:31,920
paper that came out October 15th
 

2857
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,390
paper that came out October 15th
curiously like like a day next to the

2858
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:34,400
curiously like like a day next to the
 

2859
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,789
curiously like like a day next to the
other paper I was talking about but just

2860
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:36,799
other paper I was talking about but just
 

2861
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:39,829
other paper I was talking about but just
coincidence.

2862
01:07:39,829 --> 01:07:39,839

 

2863
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:41,910

And my treatment is going to be

2864
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:41,920
And my treatment is going to be
 

2865
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,510
And my treatment is going to be
influenced very strongly by this paper

2866
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:43,520
influenced very strongly by this paper
 

2867
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,230
influenced very strongly by this paper
because I think it's nice for how it uh

2868
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:46,240
because I think it's nice for how it uh
 

2869
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,870
because I think it's nice for how it uh
talks about things.

2870
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:48,880
talks about things.
 

2871
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,470
talks about things.
So

2872
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:50,480
So
 

2873
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,150
So
you did this homework problem where we

2874
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:52,160
you did this homework problem where we
 

2875
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,670
you did this homework problem where we
talked about you know thinking about

2876
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:53,680
talked about you know thinking about
 

2877
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,670
talked about you know thinking about
scaling rules right we gave you this

2878
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:55,680
scaling rules right we gave you this
 

2879
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,950
scaling rules right we gave you this
like how do you do estimation of how how

2880
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:58,960
like how do you do estimation of how how
 

2881
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,710
like how do you do estimation of how how
you set parameters for a model given

2882
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
you set parameters for a model given
 

2883
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,990
you set parameters for a model given
some kind of extrapol how could you do

2884
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:02,000
some kind of extrapol how could you do
 

2885
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,470
some kind of extrapol how could you do
extrapolative prediction so extrap we

2886
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:04,480
extrapolative prediction so extrap we
 

2887
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,510
extrapolative prediction so extrap we
talked you saw in the homework

2888
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520
talked you saw in the homework
 

2889
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,789
talked you saw in the homework
extrapolative prediction is very

2890
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:06,799
extrapolative prediction is very
 

2891
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,630
extrapolative prediction is very
interesting and useful and it's used

2892
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:08,640
interesting and useful and it's used
 

2893
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,549
interesting and useful and it's used
practically because you're going to have

2894
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:10,559
practically because you're going to have
 

2895
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,950
practically because you're going to have
to make a potentially a large compute

2896
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:12,960
to make a potentially a large compute
 

2897
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,710
to make a potentially a large compute
decision and you want to know is this

2898
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:14,720
decision and you want to know is this
 

2899
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,870
decision and you want to know is this
worth doing or not and so you want to

2900
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
worth doing or not and so you want to
 

2901
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,470
worth doing or not and so you want to
extrapolate

2902
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:18,480
extrapolate
 

2903
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,229
extrapolate
to see how well would things go if you

2904
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:20,239
to see how well would things go if you
 

2905
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:22,229
to see how well would things go if you
did more compute

2906
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:22,239
did more compute
 

2907
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:26,149
did more compute
and we talked about you know MUP earlier

2908
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:26,159
and we talked about you know MUP earlier
 

2909
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:28,229
and we talked about you know MUP earlier
as a way of doing hyper parameter

2910
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:28,239
as a way of doing hyper parameter
 

2911
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,990
as a way of doing hyper parameter
transfer. So if you have some way of

2912
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:30,000
transfer. So if you have some way of
 

2913
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,309
transfer. So if you have some way of
extrapolating that well how would things

2914
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:32,319
extrapolating that well how would things
 

2915
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,070
extrapolating that well how would things
work potentially with something bigger

2916
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:34,080
work potentially with something bigger
 

2917
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,430
work potentially with something bigger
and that looks good you then want to say

2918
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:37,440
and that looks good you then want to say
 

2919
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,269
and that looks good you then want to say
okay how do I train it how to set the

2920
01:08:39,269 --> 01:08:39,279
okay how do I train it how to set the
 

2921
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:42,870
okay how do I train it how to set the
parameters kicks in there right so this

2922
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:42,880
parameters kicks in there right so this
 

2923
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,189
parameters kicks in there right so this
is kind of saying okay if you're doing

2924
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:45,199
is kind of saying okay if you're doing
 

2925
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:47,990
is kind of saying okay if you're doing
reinforcement learning is there any way

2926
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:48,000
reinforcement learning is there any way
 

2927
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,149
reinforcement learning is there any way
to see the main theme of the paper is

2928
01:08:50,149 --> 01:08:50,159
to see the main theme of the paper is
 

2929
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,470
to see the main theme of the paper is
there any way to see what is going to

2930
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:52,480
there any way to see what is going to
 

2931
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,870
there any way to see what is going to
work well without having to run it all

2932
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:54,880
work well without having to run it all
 

2933
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,590
work well without having to run it all
the way out everyone see this as the

2934
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:57,600
the way out everyone see this as the
 

2935
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,749
the way out everyone see this as the
interesting question. So I just want to

2936
01:08:59,749 --> 01:08:59,759
interesting question. So I just want to
 

2937
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,430
interesting question. So I just want to
use this I think the paper is nice for

2938
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:01,440
use this I think the paper is nice for
 

2939
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,510
use this I think the paper is nice for
another reason but I want to use just

2940
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:03,520
another reason but I want to use just
 

2941
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,030
another reason but I want to use just
mention the main theme of the paper as

2942
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:05,040
mention the main theme of the paper as
 

2943
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,470
mention the main theme of the paper as
well. So then you can get to the other

2944
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:06,480
well. So then you can get to the other
 

2945
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,030
well. So then you can get to the other
thing I want to talk about.

2946
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:09,040
thing I want to talk about.
 

2947
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,149
thing I want to talk about.
So what they do is they say that look

2948
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:14,159
So what they do is they say that look
 

2949
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:18,470
So what they do is they say that look
actually you can think about this

2950
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:18,480
actually you can think about this
 

2951
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,789
actually you can think about this
Sshaped curve as telling you how RL

2952
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:22,799
Sshaped curve as telling you how RL
 

2953
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,550
Sshaped curve as telling you how RL
training will proceed. So what is it

2954
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:24,560
training will proceed. So what is it
 

2955
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,950
training will proceed. So what is it
saying? It's saying that when I do RL

2956
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:26,960
saying? It's saying that when I do RL
 

2957
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,990
saying? It's saying that when I do RL
training on a log scale

2958
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,000
training on a log scale
 

2959
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,110
training on a log scale
or that it seems to have a performance

2960
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:33,120
or that it seems to have a performance
 

2961
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,349
or that it seems to have a performance
that follows this kind of functional

2962
01:09:35,349 --> 01:09:35,359
that follows this kind of functional
 

2963
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,870
that follows this kind of functional
form

2964
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:36,880
form
 

2965
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,630
form
where it starts off small

2966
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:40,640
where it starts off small
 

2967
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,749
where it starts off small
at some baseline level R0 and then as

2968
01:09:43,749 --> 01:09:43,759
at some baseline level R0 and then as
 

2969
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:46,390
at some baseline level R0 and then as
you spend more compute it doesn't move

2970
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:46,400
you spend more compute it doesn't move
 

2971
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,510
you spend more compute it doesn't move
much and then it starts going into a

2972
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:49,520
much and then it starts going into a
 

2973
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,149
much and then it starts going into a
phase of getting gains and then it

2974
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:52,159
phase of getting gains and then it
 

2975
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:54,070
phase of getting gains and then it
starts saturating

2976
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
starts saturating
 

2977
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,310
starts saturating
and what you want to do is you want to

2978
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:56,320
and what you want to do is you want to
 

2979
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,910
and what you want to do is you want to
be able to know where is it going to

2980
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:57,920
be able to know where is it going to
 

2981
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,070
be able to know where is it going to
saturate to so you can see is this worth

2982
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:00,080
saturate to so you can see is this worth
 

2983
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,270
saturate to so you can see is this worth
doing or not and so what they're saying

2984
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:03,280
doing or not and so what they're saying
 

2985
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,750
doing or not and so what they're saying
is that actually these things can be fit

2986
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:05,760
is that actually these things can be fit
 

2987
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,030
is that actually these things can be fit
if I fit past this midpoint a little bit

2988
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:09,040
if I fit past this midpoint a little bit
 

2989
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,709
if I fit past this midpoint a little bit
I fit a curve I can actually predict

2990
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:10,719
I fit a curve I can actually predict
 

2991
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:13,030
I fit a curve I can actually predict
where the thing's going to asmtote and

2992
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,040
where the thing's going to asmtote and
 

2993
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,669
where the thing's going to asmtote and
that's useful okay because this is log

2994
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:15,679
that's useful okay because this is log
 

2995
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,870
that's useful okay because this is log
scale and so going from here to here is

2996
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:18,880
scale and so going from here to here is
 

2997
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,790
scale and so going from here to here is
actually a huge amount of compute it's

2998
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:20,800
actually a huge amount of compute it's
 

2999
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,189
actually a huge amount of compute it's
like most of the compute

3000
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
like most of the compute
 

3001
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,870
like most of the compute
>> yeah

3002
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:24,880
>> yeah
 

3003
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:31,430
>> yeah
is like comput

3004
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:31,440

 

3005
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,910

>> yes C compute it's just like counting

3006
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:33,920
>> yes C compute it's just like counting
 

3007
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,350
>> yes C compute it's just like counting
counting how much computational

3008
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:35,360
counting how much computational
 

3009
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,630
counting how much computational
resources you're spending like GPU hours

3010
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:38,640
resources you're spending like GPU hours
 

3011
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,510
resources you're spending like GPU hours
>> think of this as GPU hours

3012
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:41,520
>> think of this as GPU hours
 

3013
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,430
>> think of this as GPU hours
okay so again like these numbers are

3014
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:43,440
okay so again like these numbers are
 

3015
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,870
okay so again like these numbers are
like funny from a class point of view

3016
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:44,880
like funny from a class point of view
 

3017
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,590
like funny from a class point of view
you're like okay GPU hours in thousands

3018
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:47,600
you're like okay GPU hours in thousands
 

3019
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,070
you're like okay GPU hours in thousands
on a log scale right and like you guys

3020
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,080
on a log scale right and like you guys
 

3021
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,110
on a log scale right and like you guys
are like I have eight right so it's it's

3022
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:53,120
are like I have eight right so it's it's
 

3023
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,750
are like I have eight right so it's it's
a very um assist with the reality of the

3024
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:55,760
a very um assist with the reality of the
 

3025
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,550
a very um assist with the reality of the
field, right? So,

3026
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,560
field, right? So,
 

3027
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,229
field, right? So,
and what they're doing is they're saying

3028
01:11:00,229 --> 01:11:00,239
and what they're doing is they're saying
 

3029
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:02,229
and what they're doing is they're saying
that if you're equipped with a way of

3030
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:02,239
that if you're equipped with a way of
 

3031
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:03,430
that if you're equipped with a way of
doing this prediction, then you can

3032
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:03,440
doing this prediction, then you can
 

3033
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,350
doing this prediction, then you can
actually try to think through which

3034
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:05,360
actually try to think through which
 

3035
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,790
actually try to think through which
approaches actually work well um in the

3036
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:08,800
approaches actually work well um in the
 

3037
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,550
approaches actually work well um in the
long run and which approaches only look

3038
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:10,560
long run and which approaches only look
 

3039
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,229
long run and which approaches only look
like they're working well but don't

3040
01:11:12,229 --> 01:11:12,239
like they're working well but don't
 

3041
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,189
like they're working well but don't
actually work well. So what they do is

3042
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:15,199
actually work well. So what they do is
 

3043
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,030
actually work well. So what they do is
they say as after doing all this they

3044
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:17,040
they say as after doing all this they
 

3045
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,590
they say as after doing all this they
say look I will actually have I can

3046
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:19,600
say look I will actually have I can
 

3047
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,910
say look I will actually have I can
grade different recipes for doing RL for

3048
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:23,920
grade different recipes for doing RL for
 

3049
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,990
grade different recipes for doing RL for
verifiable rewards

3050
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,000
verifiable rewards
 

3051
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,709
verifiable rewards
and remember that GRPO that we mentioned

3052
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:28,719
and remember that GRPO that we mentioned
 

3053
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,630
and remember that GRPO that we mentioned
before the deepseek recipe which I mean

3054
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:30,640
before the deepseek recipe which I mean
 

3055
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,149
before the deepseek recipe which I mean
I'm not going to talk about in full

3056
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:32,159
I'm not going to talk about in full
 

3057
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:33,750
I'm not going to talk about in full
detail as well I'll point you to some of

3058
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:33,760
detail as well I'll point you to some of
 

3059
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,070
detail as well I'll point you to some of
the things that are about it that's this

3060
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:36,080
the things that are about it that's this
 

3061
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,270
the things that are about it that's this
curve and that's right here

3062
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:39,280
curve and that's right here
 

3063
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,030
curve and that's right here
okay this is the scale is not quite

3064
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,040
okay this is the scale is not quite
 

3065
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,510
okay this is the scale is not quite
honest right because it's point 4 to 6.

3066
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:43,520
honest right because it's point 4 to 6.
 

3067
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,950
honest right because it's point 4 to 6.
So you know it's but uh it's saying that

3068
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:46,960
So you know it's but uh it's saying that
 

3069
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,870
So you know it's but uh it's saying that
there are recipes that actually get to

3070
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:48,880
there are recipes that actually get to
 

3071
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,950
there are recipes that actually get to
better asmtoic places than gRPL and the

3072
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:52,960
better asmtoic places than gRPL and the
 

3073
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,430
better asmtoic places than gRPL and the
one that they're proposing is called

3074
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:55,440
one that they're proposing is called
 

3075
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,270
one that they're proposing is called
scale scale RL which is related to uh an

3076
01:11:59,270 --> 01:11:59,280
scale scale RL which is related to uh an
 

3077
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,350
scale scale RL which is related to uh an
approach called miniax

3078
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:01,360
approach called miniax
 

3079
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,870
approach called miniax
uh which is basically so this is like a

3080
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:02,880
uh which is basically so this is like a
 

3081
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,630
uh which is basically so this is like a
more efficient version of miniax in

3082
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:04,640
more efficient version of miniax in
 

3083
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,550
more efficient version of miniax in
terms of compute is what the paper is

3084
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:06,560
terms of compute is what the paper is
 

3085
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,390
terms of compute is what the paper is
proposing.

3086
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:08,400
proposing.
 

3087
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,990
proposing.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to

3088
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:10,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 

3089
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,390
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
anchor my treatment of of uh RLVR on

3090
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:14,400
anchor my treatment of of uh RLVR on
 

3091
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,630
anchor my treatment of of uh RLVR on
this recipe to make sure you understand

3092
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:16,640
this recipe to make sure you understand
 

3093
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,790
this recipe to make sure you understand
the scale RL recipe and then I'll add

3094
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:18,800
the scale RL recipe and then I'll add
 

3095
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,110
the scale RL recipe and then I'll add
some terms to it that so you can

3096
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:21,120
some terms to it that so you can
 

3097
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,709
some terms to it that so you can
understand some of the others.

3098
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
understand some of the others.
 

3099
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,350
understand some of the others.
Okay, so everyone understands this kind

3100
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:27,360
Okay, so everyone understands this kind
 

3101
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,790
Okay, so everyone understands this kind
of idea of having a scaling law how it

3102
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:28,800
of idea of having a scaling law how it
 

3103
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,310
of idea of having a scaling law how it
might be useful. This is the first kind

3104
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:30,320
might be useful. This is the first kind
 

3105
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,030
might be useful. This is the first kind
of major scaling law for RL that could

3106
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
of major scaling law for RL that could
 

3107
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,950
of major scaling law for RL that could
predict where the asmtoic things were.

3108
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:34,960
predict where the asmtoic things were.
 

3109
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,470
predict where the asmtoic things were.
Empirically, of course, you don't have

3110
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:36,480
Empirically, of course, you don't have
 

3111
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,149
Empirically, of course, you don't have
theorems about this. just empirically it

3112
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:38,159
theorems about this. just empirically it
 

3113
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:41,350
theorems about this. just empirically it
seems to do this.

3114
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:41,360
seems to do this.
 

3115
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,990
seems to do this.
Okay, so

3116
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:44,000
Okay, so
 

3117
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,910
Okay, so
here so here's the problem. You start

3118
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:47,920
here so here's the problem. You start
 

3119
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,229
here so here's the problem. You start
off and you look in the paper and you

3120
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:50,239
off and you look in the paper and you
 

3121
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:51,830
off and you look in the paper and you
say, "Okay, what's the loss function?

3122
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
say, "Okay, what's the loss function?
 

3123
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,990
say, "Okay, what's the loss function?
You're gonna use blip

3124
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:54,000
You're gonna use blip
 

3125
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,830
You're gonna use blip
this." And the my goal is to make it

3126
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:57,840
this." And the my goal is to make it
 

3127
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,990
this." And the my goal is to make it
possible for you to understand what is

3128
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:00,000
possible for you to understand what is
 

3129
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,870
possible for you to understand what is
going on here and why is this happening

3130
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:02,880
going on here and why is this happening
 

3131
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,470
going on here and why is this happening
like why what are these choices mean

3132
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:04,480
like why what are these choices mean
 

3133
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,510
like why what are these choices mean
like what is even happening here. Okay,

3134
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,520
like what is even happening here. Okay,
 

3135
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,030
like what is even happening here. Okay,
so

3136
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,040
so
 

3137
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,709
so
let's look at what this is saying.

3138
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:12,719
let's look at what this is saying.
 

3139
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:17,750
let's look at what this is saying.
First thing this is saying is that

3140
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:17,760
First thing this is saying is that
 

3141
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,350
First thing this is saying is that
let's look at notation. Pyen

3142
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,360
let's look at notation. Pyen
 

3143
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,910
let's look at notation. Pyen
is the

3144
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:23,920
is the
 

3145
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,910
is the
probability you're going to be used to

3146
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:25,920
probability you're going to be used to
 

3147
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,630
probability you're going to be used to
generate examples. So how does RLHF

3148
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:28,640
generate examples. So how does RLHF
 

3149
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,669
generate examples. So how does RLHF
work? RLHF works like this. You take a

3150
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:31,679
work? RLHF works like this. You take a
 

3151
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:35,350
work? RLHF works like this. You take a
problem, a prompt and you say I'm now

3152
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:35,360
problem, a prompt and you say I'm now
 

3153
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,430
problem, a prompt and you say I'm now
going to generate

3154
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:37,440
going to generate
 

3155
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,350
going to generate
G capital G responses.

3156
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:41,360
G capital G responses.
 

3157
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,070
G capital G responses.
So, I'm going take 1,00 think of G as

3158
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:44,080
So, I'm going take 1,00 think of G as
 

3159
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,550
So, I'm going take 1,00 think of G as
1,00. I'll take 1,000 answers to this

3160
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:46,560
1,00. I'll take 1,000 answers to this
 

3161
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,149
1,00. I'll take 1,000 answers to this
question.

3162
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:48,159
question.
 

3163
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:59,510
question.
So, G is generations.

3164
01:13:59,510 --> 01:13:59,520

 

3165
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,950

Then what's the intuition? The intuition

3166
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:02,960
Then what's the intuition? The intuition
 

3167
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,830
Then what's the intuition? The intuition
is like this. Very simple. It says for

3168
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:05,840
is like this. Very simple. It says for
 

3169
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,229
is like this. Very simple. It says for
all these generations I can score them.

3170
01:14:08,229 --> 01:14:08,239
all these generations I can score them.
 

3171
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,229
all these generations I can score them.
You can think of the score as being one

3172
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:10,239
You can think of the score as being one
 

3173
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:13,910
You can think of the score as being one
correct answer, zero incorrect answer.

3174
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:13,920
correct answer, zero incorrect answer.
 

3175
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:19,669
correct answer, zero incorrect answer.
So intuitively there's three big cases.

3176
01:14:19,669 --> 01:14:19,679
So intuitively there's three big cases.
 

3177
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:21,830
So intuitively there's three big cases.
You do a thousand generations and none

3178
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:21,840
You do a thousand generations and none
 

3179
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,470
You do a thousand generations and none
of them are right.

3180
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
of them are right.
 

3181
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,830
of them are right.
Okay, in that case you're like, I don't

3182
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:27,840
Okay, in that case you're like, I don't
 

3183
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,070
Okay, in that case you're like, I don't
know what to do here. I only know lots

3184
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:30,080
know what to do here. I only know lots
 

3185
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,270
know what to do here. I only know lots
of things that are wrong. There's some

3186
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:31,280
of things that are wrong. There's some
 

3187
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,030
of things that are wrong. There's some
interesting work on trying to learn from

3188
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:33,040
interesting work on trying to learn from
 

3189
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,709
interesting work on trying to learn from
even cases where everything is wrong,

3190
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:34,719
even cases where everything is wrong,
 

3191
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:36,950
even cases where everything is wrong,
but I'm not going to talk about that.

3192
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:36,960
but I'm not going to talk about that.
 

3193
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,430
but I'm not going to talk about that.
Other case, I do a thousand generations

3194
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:39,440
Other case, I do a thousand generations
 

3195
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,590
Other case, I do a thousand generations
and they're all right.

3196
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:41,600
and they're all right.
 

3197
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,990
and they're all right.
And it's like, okay, I'm getting these

3198
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:44,000
And it's like, okay, I'm getting these
 

3199
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,350
And it's like, okay, I'm getting these
right. Nothing much to do here.

3200
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:47,360
right. Nothing much to do here.
 

3201
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,430
right. Nothing much to do here.
Then there's some of them are right and

3202
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:49,440
Then there's some of them are right and
 

3203
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:53,030
Then there's some of them are right and
some of them are wrong. Okay.

3204
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,040
some of them are wrong. Okay.
 

3205
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,350
some of them are wrong. Okay.
Now, if you have some that are right and

3206
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:55,360
Now, if you have some that are right and
 

3207
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,510
Now, if you have some that are right and
some that are wrong, the idea of RL says

3208
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
some that are wrong, the idea of RL says
 

3209
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:03,110
some that are wrong, the idea of RL says
good doggy to the ones that are right,

3210
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:03,120
good doggy to the ones that are right,
 

3211
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,830
good doggy to the ones that are right,
bad doggy to the ones that are wrong.

3212
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:05,840
bad doggy to the ones that are wrong.
 

3213
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,229
bad doggy to the ones that are wrong.
Okay, what do I mean by that? It says

3214
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:08,239
Okay, what do I mean by that? It says
 

3215
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,550
Okay, what do I mean by that? It says
the ones that are right make the model

3216
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:10,560
the ones that are right make the model
 

3217
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,870
the ones that are right make the model
more likely to generate those and the

3218
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:12,880
more likely to generate those and the
 

3219
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,950
more likely to generate those and the
ones that are wrong make the model less

3220
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:14,960
ones that are wrong make the model less
 

3221
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,430
ones that are wrong make the model less
likely to generate those.

3222
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:17,440
likely to generate those.
 

3223
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,470
likely to generate those.
That's the high level picture. So RLVR

3224
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:20,480
That's the high level picture. So RLVR
 

3225
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,470
That's the high level picture. So RLVR
requires there to be some mixture of

3226
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:22,480
requires there to be some mixture of
 

3227
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,390
requires there to be some mixture of
these. Now it's about details. How do

3228
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:24,400
these. Now it's about details. How do
 

3229
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,550
these. Now it's about details. How do
you get this to work?

3230
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:26,560
you get this to work?
 

3231
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,669
you get this to work?
So that's what the generations are.

3232
01:15:29,669 --> 01:15:29,679
So that's what the generations are.
 

3233
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,830
So that's what the generations are.
So now there's this twist. You have to

3234
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:33,840
So now there's this twist. You have to
 

3235
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,990
So now there's this twist. You have to
do these generations.

3236
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:36,000
do these generations.
 

3237
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,550
do these generations.
In an ideal theoretical world, you would

3238
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:38,560
In an ideal theoretical world, you would
 

3239
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,709
In an ideal theoretical world, you would
be doing these generations using the

3240
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:40,719
be doing these generations using the
 

3241
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:43,430
be doing these generations using the
model that you're training.

3242
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:43,440
model that you're training.
 

3243
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,030
model that you're training.
Okay?

3244
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:45,040
Okay?
 

3245
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:48,630
Okay?
In practice, you will not

3246
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:48,640
In practice, you will not
 

3247
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,229
In practice, you will not
you will do these generations using

3248
01:15:50,229 --> 01:15:50,239
you will do these generations using
 

3249
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,709
you will do these generations using
something else. Why will I use something

3250
01:15:52,709 --> 01:15:52,719
something else. Why will I use something
 

3251
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:56,709
something else. Why will I use something
else? Because one simple thing is code

3252
01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:56,719
else? Because one simple thing is code
 

3253
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,350
else? Because one simple thing is code
that is optimized for doing generation

3254
01:15:59,350 --> 01:15:59,360
that is optimized for doing generation
 

3255
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,350
that is optimized for doing generation
is different than code that is optimized

3256
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:01,360
is different than code that is optimized
 

3257
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,910
is different than code that is optimized
for doing training.

3258
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:03,920
for doing training.
 

3259
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,750
for doing training.
So at the very least you'll be using two

3260
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:05,760
So at the very least you'll be using two
 

3261
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,830
So at the very least you'll be using two
different sets of code. Do the

3262
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:07,840
different sets of code. Do the
 

3263
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,669
different sets of code. Do the
generations. the two different sets of

3264
01:16:09,669 --> 01:16:09,679
generations. the two different sets of
 

3265
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:11,189
generations. the two different sets of
code will actually generate things

3266
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:11,199
code will actually generate things
 

3267
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,590
code will actually generate things
slightly differently for numerical

3268
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:13,600
slightly differently for numerical
 

3269
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,550
slightly differently for numerical
reasons alone because they're optimized,

3270
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:16,560
reasons alone because they're optimized,
 

3271
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,149
reasons alone because they're optimized,
right? You're using finite precision. So

3272
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:18,159
right? You're using finite precision. So
 

3273
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,669
right? You're using finite precision. So
you'll never be generating with exactly

3274
01:16:19,669 --> 01:16:19,679
you'll never be generating with exactly
 

3275
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:22,149
you'll never be generating with exactly
the distribution you're training.

3276
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:22,159
the distribution you're training.
 

3277
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:23,270
the distribution you're training.
So you have to recognize there's two

3278
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:23,280
So you have to recognize there's two
 

3279
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,430
So you have to recognize there's two
different distributions. That's why

3280
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:25,440
different distributions. That's why
 

3281
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,310
different distributions. That's why
there is this thing that's being trained

3282
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:28,320
there is this thing that's being trained
 

3283
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,470
there is this thing that's being trained
distribution and the thing that's being

3284
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:30,480
distribution and the thing that's being
 

3285
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,709
distribution and the thing that's being
generated distribution. And you have to

3286
01:16:32,709 --> 01:16:32,719
generated distribution. And you have to
 

3287
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:33,990
generated distribution. And you have to
account for the fact these two are

3288
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:34,000
account for the fact these two are
 

3289
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,310
account for the fact these two are
different.

3290
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:36,320
different.
 

3291
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,990
different.
A lack of accounting for the fact that

3292
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:38,000
A lack of accounting for the fact that
 

3293
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,430
A lack of accounting for the fact that
these two are different will cause

3294
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:39,440
these two are different will cause
 

3295
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,870
these two are different will cause
training RL training to fail.

3296
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:42,880
training RL training to fail.
 

3297
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,550
training RL training to fail.
Okay, so this is one thing that's been

3298
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,560
Okay, so this is one thing that's been
 

3299
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,070
Okay, so this is one thing that's been
around here. Okay, so now let's talk

3300
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:48,080
around here. Okay, so now let's talk
 

3301
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,830
around here. Okay, so now let's talk
about some more of the terms here.

3302
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:51,840
about some more of the terms here.
 

3303
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,310
about some more of the terms here.
Easy ones to explain.

3304
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:54,320
Easy ones to explain.
 

3305
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,350
Easy ones to explain.
This one

3306
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:57,360
This one
 

3307
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,110
This one
says

3308
01:16:59,110 --> 01:16:59,120
says
 

3309
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,310
says
don't bother

3310
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:02,320
don't bother
 

3311
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,470
don't bother
if

3312
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,480
if
 

3313
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,430
if
we get

3314
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:07,440
we get
 

3315
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,229
we get
90% right.

3316
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:10,239
90% right.
 

3317
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:11,669
90% right.
We said we don't bother if you get them

3318
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:11,679
We said we don't bother if you get them
 

3319
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:13,510
We said we don't bother if you get them
all right. But it says if you get 90%

3320
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:13,520
all right. But it says if you get 90%
 

3321
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,070
all right. But it says if you get 90%
right, don't bother. Like don't don't

3322
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:16,080
right, don't bother. Like don't don't
 

3323
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,110
right, don't bother. Like don't don't
try to train on it. Just throw it away.

3324
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:19,120
try to train on it. Just throw it away.
 

3325
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,189
try to train on it. Just throw it away.
Okay, that's what this part means.

3326
01:17:23,189 --> 01:17:23,199
Okay, that's what this part means.
 

3327
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,669
Okay, that's what this part means.
Now

3328
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:25,679
Now
 

3329
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,390
Now
comes the rest. Okay. So yeah,

3330
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:28,400
comes the rest. Okay. So yeah,
 

3331
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,390
comes the rest. Okay. So yeah,
>> where is the pass rate used in the

01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:30,400
>> where is the pass rate used in the
 

3333
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,110
>> where is the pass rate used in the
above?

3334
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:31,120
above?
 

3335
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:34,870
above?
>> Ah, it says that I only will execute any

3336
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:34,880

3337
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,229
>> Ah, it says that I only will execute any
of this if this pass rate is this way.

3338
01:17:38,229 --> 01:17:38,239
of this if this pass rate is this way.
 

3339
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:41,189
of this if this pass rate is this way.
If I don't if my pass rate is above 90%,

3340
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:41,199
If I don't if my pass rate is above 90%,
 

3341
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,189
If I don't if my pass rate is above 90%,
I'm not even going to run a the loss is

3342
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:43,199
I'm not even going to run a the loss is
 

3343
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:44,790
I'm not even going to run a the loss is
zero. Just move on.

3344
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:44,800
zero. Just move on.
 

3345
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,590
zero. Just move on.
>> Yeah,

3346
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:47,600
>> Yeah,
 

3347
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,590
>> Yeah,
>> this is related to PO. Everything is

3351
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,510

Okay. So now I want to remind we made

3352
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:55,520
Okay. So now I want to remind we made
 

3353
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,070
Okay. So now I want to remind we made
you do a homework. So now let's remember

3354
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:58,080
you do a homework. So now let's remember
 

3355
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,229
you do a homework. So now let's remember
this homework that we made you do. In

3356
01:18:00,229 --> 01:18:00,239
this homework that we made you do. In
 

3357
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:01,910
this homework that we made you do. In
this homework we said how do you deal

3358
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
this homework we said how do you deal
 

3359
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,630
this homework we said how do you deal
with the fact of not having a gradient

3360
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:04,640
with the fact of not having a gradient
 

3361
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,110
with the fact of not having a gradient
because the function you want to

3362
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:07,120
because the function you want to
 

3363
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,550
because the function you want to
optimize doesn't let you take a

3364
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:08,560
optimize doesn't let you take a
 

3365
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,709
optimize doesn't let you take a
gradient.

3366
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:10,719
gradient.
 

3367
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,110
gradient.
And we said hey if the thing you're

3368
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:13,120
And we said hey if the thing you're
 

3369
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,830
And we said hey if the thing you're
optimizing is a probability distribution

3370
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
optimizing is a probability distribution
 

3371
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,189
optimizing is a probability distribution
what you need to be able to do is to

3372
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:17,199
what you need to be able to do is to
 

3373
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,630
what you need to be able to do is to
have a gradient on the parameters for

3374
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:18,640
have a gradient on the parameters for
 

3375
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,070
have a gradient on the parameters for
the probability distribution for this

3376
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:20,080
the probability distribution for this
 

3377
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,709
the probability distribution for this
expectation. And we made you do it first

3378
01:18:22,709 --> 01:18:22,719
expectation. And we made you do it first
 

3379
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,709
expectation. And we made you do it first
in code. Then we had the code, have you

3380
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:24,719
in code. Then we had the code, have you
 

3381
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:25,990
in code. Then we had the code, have you
work through a version of it, then we

3382
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,000
work through a version of it, then we
 

3383
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,830
work through a version of it, then we
had you work through it a Gaussian toy

3384
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:27,840
had you work through it a Gaussian toy
 

3385
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,310
had you work through it a Gaussian toy
of it for the Gaussian case. And then we

3386
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:30,320
of it for the Gaussian case. And then we
 

3387
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,990
of it for the Gaussian case. And then we
had you think about it and say, "Hey,

3388
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:32,000
had you think about it and say, "Hey,
 

3389
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,110
had you think about it and say, "Hey,
actually in general, this kind of

3390
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:35,120
actually in general, this kind of
 

3391
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,270
actually in general, this kind of
expression

3392
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:37,280
expression
 

3393
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,310
expression
can be done as this other expectation."

3394
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:40,320
can be done as this other expectation."
 

3395
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,310
can be done as this other expectation."
So this is in the homework. We made you

3396
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:42,320
So this is in the homework. We made you
 

3397
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,669
So this is in the homework. We made you
do this. This is math. So instead of

3398
01:18:45,669 --> 01:18:45,679
do this. This is math. So instead of
 

3399
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:48,229
do this. This is math. So instead of
doing a gradient of an expectation, I

3400
01:18:48,229 --> 01:18:48,239
doing a gradient of an expectation, I
 

3401
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:49,910
doing a gradient of an expectation, I
can do an expectation of a different

3402
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:49,920
can do an expectation of a different
 

3403
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,350
can do an expectation of a different
thing.

3404
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:51,360
thing.
 

3405
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,149
thing.
And what I can do is I don't have to run

3406
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:54,159
And what I can do is I don't have to run
 

3407
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:55,669
And what I can do is I don't have to run
a derivative on the thing I can't

3408
01:18:55,669 --> 01:18:55,679
a derivative on the thing I can't
 

3409
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,790
a derivative on the thing I can't
differentiate the f.

3410
01:18:58,790 --> 01:18:58,800
differentiate the f.
 

3411
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,470
differentiate the f.
But I can take a gradient on the

3412
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:00,480
But I can take a gradient on the
 

3413
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,550
But I can take a gradient on the
probability except to take it on the log

3414
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:02,560
probability except to take it on the log
 

3415
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,149
probability except to take it on the log
probability.

3416
01:19:04,149 --> 01:19:04,159
probability.
 

3417
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:09,990
probability.
Okay, this is this

3418
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:10,000

 

3419
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,630

you see that? So this you've already

3420
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:12,640
you see that? So this you've already
 

3421
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,149
you see that? So this you've already
seen in the homework. This is that

3422
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:14,159
seen in the homework. This is that
 

3423
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:18,630
seen in the homework. This is that
trick. That's what this is.

3424
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:18,640
trick. That's what this is.
 

3425
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:30,229
trick. That's what this is.
So this

3426
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:30,239

 

3427
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:33,830

is that. Now from the perspective of

3428
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:33,840
is that. Now from the perspective of
 

3429
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,229
is that. Now from the perspective of
homework three, if this is this, then

3430
01:19:38,229 --> 01:19:38,239
homework three, if this is this, then
 

3431
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,390
homework three, if this is this, then
everything else

3432
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:40,400
everything else
 

3433
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,590
everything else
is this.

3434
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:43,600
is this.
 

3435
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,669
is this.
Okay, which is what? It's the thing that

3436
01:19:45,669 --> 01:19:45,679
Okay, which is what? It's the thing that
 

3437
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,310
Okay, which is what? It's the thing that
you want to make better.

3438
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:48,320
you want to make better.
 

3439
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:59,350
you want to make better.
>> Yeah.

3440
01:19:59,350 --> 01:19:59,360

 

3441
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,110

We don't do that.

3442
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:01,120
We don't do that.
 

3443
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,110
We don't do that.
>> Oh, we do definitely do. We definitely

3444
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:03,120
>> Oh, we do definitely do. We definitely
 

3445
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:03,990
>> Oh, we do definitely do. We definitely
do that.

3446
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:04,000
do that.
 

3447
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,669
do that.
>> So, it's like iteration like

3448
01:20:05,669 --> 01:20:05,679
>> So, it's like iteration like
 

3449
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:05,990
>> So, it's like iteration like
>> Yes.

3450
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:06,000
>> Yes.
 

3451
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,430
>> Yes.
>> Just like

3452
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:07,440
>> Just like
 

3453
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,229
>> Just like
>> Yeah. Yeah. At every time that you're

3454
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:10,239
>> Yeah. Yeah. At every time that you're
 

3455
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,950
>> Yeah. Yeah. At every time that you're
doing this, you're always using a stale

3456
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:12,960
doing this, you're always using a stale
 

3457
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,630
doing this, you're always using a stale
thing or a different thing to do the

3458
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:14,640
thing or a different thing to do the
 

3459
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,550
thing or a different thing to do the
generations, but you don't want it to be

3460
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:16,560
generations, but you don't want it to be
 

3461
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,669
generations, but you don't want it to be
too far behind.

3462
01:20:17,669 --> 01:20:17,679
too far behind.
 

3463
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,110
too far behind.
>> And then we just have things.

3464
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:19,120
>> And then we just have things.
 

3465
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,830
>> And then we just have things.
>> Yes. And so there's many tricks here. I

3466
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:21,840
>> Yes. And so there's many tricks here. I
 

3467
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,350
>> Yes. And so there's many tricks here. I
will see how fast how much I can do. I

3468
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,360
will see how fast how much I can do. I
 

3469
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,070
will see how fast how much I can do. I
want to make sure you get this

3470
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:24,080
want to make sure you get this
 

3471
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,229
want to make sure you get this
expression.

3472
01:20:26,229 --> 01:20:26,239
expression.
 

3473
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:33,430
expression.
So everything here is spiritually F

3474
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
So everything here is spiritually F
 

3475
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,470
So everything here is spiritually F
which is the thing we want to make

3476
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:34,480
which is the thing we want to make
 

3477
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,790
which is the thing we want to make
better. So how let's like unpack it some

3478
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:36,800
better. So how let's like unpack it some
 

3479
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,270
better. So how let's like unpack it some
more. Okay. So the key thing is this

3480
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:41,280
more. Okay. So the key thing is this
 

3481
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:49,669
more. Okay. So the key thing is this
term here.

3482
01:20:49,669 --> 01:20:49,679

 

3483
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:51,510

Okay.

3484
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:51,520
Okay.
 

3485
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,189
Okay.
This is called normalized advantage.

3486
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:55,199
This is called normalized advantage.
 

3487
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:57,430
This is called normalized advantage.
And what it means is it says of the

3488
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:57,440
And what it means is it says of the
 

3489
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,070
And what it means is it says of the
generations I did,

3490
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:00,080
generations I did,
 

3491
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,350
generations I did,
is this a good doggy or a bad doggy?

3492
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:03,360
is this a good doggy or a bad doggy?
 

3493
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,350
is this a good doggy or a bad doggy?
Okay, is it going to be raised up or

3494
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:05,360
Okay, is it going to be raised up or
 

3495
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,750
Okay, is it going to be raised up or
raised down?

3496
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:07,760
raised down?
 

3497
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,630
raised down?
So if it gets a reward, I want to move

3498
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:10,640
So if it gets a reward, I want to move
 

3499
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,870
So if it gets a reward, I want to move
it up. If it doesn't get a reward, I

3500
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:12,880
it up. If it doesn't get a reward, I
 

3501
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,669
it up. If it doesn't get a reward, I
want to move it down. Everyone clear? So

3502
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:15,679
want to move it down. Everyone clear? So
 

3503
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:19,590
want to move it down. Everyone clear? So
how do I do that? I do two things.

3504
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:19,600
how do I do that? I do two things.
 

3505
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:24,709
how do I do that? I do two things.
First thing I do is I remove the mean.

3506
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:24,719
First thing I do is I remove the mean.
 

3507
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,229
First thing I do is I remove the mean.
Why do I remove the mean? Because I want

3508
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:26,239
Why do I remove the mean? Because I want
 

3509
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:27,750
Why do I remove the mean? Because I want
some of them to be positive and some to

3510
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:27,760
some of them to be positive and some to
 

3511
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,430
some of them to be positive and some to
be negative.

3512
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:29,440
be negative.
 

3513
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:32,149
be negative.
Right? I want to go up, raise the

3514
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:32,159
Right? I want to go up, raise the
 

3515
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:33,669
Right? I want to go up, raise the
probability of things that are positive

3516
01:21:33,669 --> 01:21:33,679
probability of things that are positive
 

3517
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:35,350
probability of things that are positive
and reduce the probability of things

3518
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:35,360
and reduce the probability of things
 

3519
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,790
and reduce the probability of things
that are negative. Everyone with me? How

3520
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:36,800
that are negative. Everyone with me? How
 

3521
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,470
that are negative. Everyone with me? How
do I do that? I simply take the average

3522
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:38,480
do I do that? I simply take the average
 

3523
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:42,390
do I do that? I simply take the average
reward and subtract it from the batch.

3524
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:42,400
reward and subtract it from the batch.
 

3525
01:21:42,400 --> 01:22:03,189
reward and subtract it from the batch.
That's this.

3526
01:22:03,189 --> 01:22:03,199

 

3527
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:06,709

Okay. Second is I normalize it by the

3528
01:22:06,709 --> 01:22:06,719
Okay. Second is I normalize it by the
 

3529
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,070
Okay. Second is I normalize it by the
standard deviation. So it's on a

3530
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,080
standard deviation. So it's on a
 

3531
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:12,629
standard deviation. So it's on a
standard scale.

3532
01:22:12,629 --> 01:22:12,639

 

3533
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,950

Okay. So this is just like input

3534
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:14,960
Okay. So this is just like input
 

3535
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,390
Okay. So this is just like input
standardization. It's like reward

3536
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:16,400
standardization. It's like reward
 

3537
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,350
standardization. It's like reward
standardization.

3538
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:19,360
standardization.
 

3539
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,669
standardization.
So this is the this is just the standard

3540
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
So this is the this is just the standard
 

3541
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:24,390
So this is the this is just the standard
deviation across the batch.

3542
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:24,400
deviation across the batch.
 

3543
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,470
deviation across the batch.
Batch by batch I mean this generation

3544
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,480
Batch by batch I mean this generation
 

3545
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,709
Batch by batch I mean this generation
batch. Okay. It's actually all the

3546
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:28,719
batch. Okay. It's actually all the
 

3547
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:31,110
batch. Okay. It's actually all the
rollouts.

3548
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:31,120
rollouts.
 

3549
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,270
rollouts.
Everyone good? Yeah.

3550
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:33,280
Everyone good? Yeah.
 

3551
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,470
Everyone good? Yeah.
>> How are you computing the advantage

3552
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:34,480
>> How are you computing the advantage
 

3553
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,750
>> How are you computing the advantage
estimates? Is there a separate reward

3554
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:35,760
estimates? Is there a separate reward
 

3555
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,270
estimates? Is there a separate reward
function for that?

3556
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:37,280
function for that?
 

3557
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,110
function for that?
>> Oh yeah. I verifiable reward. So every

3558
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:39,120
>> Oh yeah. I verifiable reward. So every
 

3559
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,669
>> Oh yeah. I verifiable reward. So every
time I can score I autograde everything.

3560
01:22:41,669 --> 01:22:41,679
time I can score I autograde everything.
 

3561
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:44,149
time I can score I autograde everything.
So I get a generation, I autograde it.

3562
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:44,159
So I get a generation, I autograde it.
 

3563
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,390
So I get a generation, I autograde it.
You can think of it as binary. Good or

3564
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:46,400
You can think of it as binary. Good or
 

3565
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,430
You can think of it as binary. Good or
bad. Good ones get a reward of one. Bad

3566
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:49,440
bad. Good ones get a reward of one. Bad
 

3567
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,629
bad. Good ones get a reward of one. Bad
ones get a reward of zero. But you could

3568
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:50,639
ones get a reward of zero. But you could
 

3569
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:54,390
ones get a reward of zero. But you could
be more than more general than that.

3570
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:54,400
be more than more general than that.
 

3571
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,030
be more than more general than that.
Okay. So that's where verifiable rewards

3572
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
Okay. So that's where verifiable rewards
 

3573
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,310
Okay. So that's where verifiable rewards
come in because I can do this. So this

3574
01:22:58,310 --> 01:22:58,320
come in because I can do this. So this
 

3575
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:07,990
come in because I can do this. So this
is remember this is from VR

3576
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:08,000

 

3577
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:08,629

>> question. Yeah.

3578
01:23:08,629 --> 01:23:08,639
>> question. Yeah.
 

3579
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:10,390
>> question. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Sorry. Could you explain what pi

3580
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:10,400
>> Yeah. Sorry. Could you explain what pi
 

3581
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,950
>> Yeah. Sorry. Could you explain what pi
train and pull are exactly?

3582
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:12,960
train and pull are exactly?
 

3583
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,310
train and pull are exactly?
>> I'll come to those. Okay. So now we have

3584
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
>> I'll come to those. Okay. So now we have
 

3585
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,229
>> I'll come to those. Okay. So now we have
understood through here.

3586
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:20,239
understood through here.
 

3587
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:25,110
understood through here.
So now comes a bit of subtlety. Okay.

3588
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:25,120
So now comes a bit of subtlety. Okay.
 

3589
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,790
So now comes a bit of subtlety. Okay.
The subtlety goes that I have these

3590
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:28,800
The subtlety goes that I have these
 

3591
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,629
The subtlety goes that I have these
generations

3592
01:23:30,629 --> 01:23:30,639
generations
 

3593
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:33,430
generations
and these generations are all responses

3594
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:33,440
and these generations are all responses
 

3595
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,709
and these generations are all responses
and they might be different things long.

3596
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:36,719
and they might be different things long.
 

3597
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:39,750
and they might be different things long.
How should I think about this?

3598
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:39,760
How should I think about this?
 

3599
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,590
How should I think about this?
I have two ways of thinking about it. I

3600
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:41,600
I have two ways of thinking about it. I
 

3601
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,189
I have two ways of thinking about it. I
can think of it as a collection of

3602
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:43,199
can think of it as a collection of
 

3603
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:46,310
can think of it as a collection of
responses individually or I can think of

3604
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
responses individually or I can think of
 

3605
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,629
responses individually or I can think of
it as a bag of tokens. Some responses

3606
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:48,639
it as a bag of tokens. Some responses
 

3607
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,470
it as a bag of tokens. Some responses
might be long, some might be short.

3608
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:50,480
might be long, some might be short.
 

3609
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,430
might be long, some might be short.
They're just bags of tokens.

3610
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:53,440
They're just bags of tokens.
 

3611
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:57,110
They're just bags of tokens.
Okay, this takes the bag of token point

3612
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:57,120
Okay, this takes the bag of token point
 

3613
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,870
Okay, this takes the bag of token point
of view. So when I look at the

3614
01:23:58,870 --> 01:23:58,880
of view. So when I look at the
 

3615
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,950
of view. So when I look at the
probability, I look at the probability

3616
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:00,960
probability, I look at the probability
 

3617
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,390
probability, I look at the probability
of this specific token

3618
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:04,400
of this specific token
 

3619
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,550
of this specific token
being generated. Okay, that's what this

3620
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:06,560
being generated. Okay, that's what this
 

3621
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,149
being generated. Okay, that's what this
thing is is telling me.

3622
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:10,159
thing is is telling me.
 

3623
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:12,790
thing is is telling me.
And then I sum up over all of the

3624
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:12,800
And then I sum up over all of the
 

3625
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,709
And then I sum up over all of the
tokens. And I sum up this like this is

3626
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:14,719
tokens. And I sum up this like this is
 

3627
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:17,030
tokens. And I sum up this like this is
sum over the entire bag of tokens. And

3628
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:17,040
sum over the entire bag of tokens. And
 

3629
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,709
sum over the entire bag of tokens. And
this is normalized by the total number

3630
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:18,719
this is normalized by the total number
 

3631
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,350
this is normalized by the total number
of tokens.

3632
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:21,360
of tokens.
 

3633
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:42,149
of tokens.
Everyone see that? Okay. So this

3634
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:42,159

 

3635
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:45,030

just a perspective that one does. Okay.

3636
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:45,040
just a perspective that one does. Okay.
 

3637
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:50,070
just a perspective that one does. Okay.
Now here comes the issue. The issue is

3638
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,080
Now here comes the issue. The issue is
 

3639
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:53,910
Now here comes the issue. The issue is
homework three said I would like it's

3640
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,920
homework three said I would like it's
 

3641
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,310
homework three said I would like it's
very important in homework three that

3642
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:56,320
very important in homework three that
 

3643
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:01,270
very important in homework three that
this p theta is the same as this p theta

3644
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:01,280
this p theta is the same as this p theta
 

3645
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,430
this p theta is the same as this p theta
very important the expectation should be

3646
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:03,440
very important the expectation should be
 

3647
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,550
very important the expectation should be
of the thing that you're taking the

3648
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:04,560
of the thing that you're taking the
 

3649
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,669
of the thing that you're taking the
gradient of we have a problem here

3650
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:07,679
gradient of we have a problem here
 

3651
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:09,350
gradient of we have a problem here
problem is I'm generating under

3652
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:09,360
problem is I'm generating under
 

3653
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,470
problem is I'm generating under
something different

3654
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:12,480
something different
 

3655
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,270
something different
so when I do this the generations are

3656
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:15,280
so when I do this the generations are
 

3657
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,669
so when I do this the generations are
not under the thing I

3658
01:25:17,669 --> 01:25:17,679
not under the thing I
 

3659
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:21,510
not under the thing I
Everyone see this issue? So I have to

3660
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:21,520
Everyone see this issue? So I have to
 

3661
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,430
Everyone see this issue? So I have to
fix this somehow. How do I fix it? I fix

3662
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:25,440
fix this somehow. How do I fix it? I fix
 

3663
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,030
fix this somehow. How do I fix it? I fix
this with an idea called important

3664
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:27,040
this with an idea called important
 

3665
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,629
this with an idea called important
sampling.

3666
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:28,639
sampling.
 

3667
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:31,430
sampling.
And what important sampling says is that

3668
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:31,440
And what important sampling says is that
 

3669
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,070
And what important sampling says is that
if something actually has a probability

3670
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:34,080
if something actually has a probability
 

3671
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,310
if something actually has a probability
that's higher under my distribution than

3672
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:36,320
that's higher under my distribution than
 

3673
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,390
that's higher under my distribution than
what this thing would generate it as,

3674
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:38,400
what this thing would generate it as,
 

3675
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,270
what this thing would generate it as,
count this more.

3676
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:41,280
count this more.
 

3677
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,110
count this more.
Okay? If it has a lower probability,

3678
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:43,120
Okay? If it has a lower probability,
 

3679
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,709
Okay? If it has a lower probability,
count it less. And that's what this is

3680
01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:44,719
count it less. And that's what this is
 

3681
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,790
count it less. And that's what this is
doing. to think on this particular

3682
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:46,800
doing. to think on this particular
 

3683
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,790
doing. to think on this particular
token, how would the two different

3684
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:48,800
token, how would the two different
 

3685
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,950
token, how would the two different
distributions generate it? Compute the

3686
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:50,960
distributions generate it? Compute the
 

3687
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,189
distributions generate it? Compute the
ratio. This is to patch the fact that

3688
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:53,199
ratio. This is to patch the fact that
 

3689
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:54,229
ratio. This is to patch the fact that
I'm generating with the wrong

3690
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:54,239
I'm generating with the wrong
 

3691
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,950
I'm generating with the wrong
distribution.

3692
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:56,960
distribution.
 

3693
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:19,350
distribution.
Okay, that's this.

3694
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:19,360

 

3695
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,110

Okay,

3696
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,120
Okay,
 

3697
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:24,149
Okay,
finally now we have we understand all

3698
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:24,159
finally now we have we understand all
 

3699
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:26,550
finally now we have we understand all
the terms here. This just says as long

3700
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:26,560
the terms here. This just says as long
 

3701
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,229
the terms here. This just says as long
as the pass rate is less than 90% I

3702
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:28,239
as the pass rate is less than 90% I
 

3703
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:29,990
as the pass rate is less than 90% I
don't care where the mean is of the

3704
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:30,000
don't care where the mean is of the
 

3705
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,310
don't care where the mean is of the
reward. Let it be whatever it is. I'm

3706
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:32,320
reward. Let it be whatever it is. I'm
 

3707
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,430
reward. Let it be whatever it is. I'm
happy. It should it should not be zero.

3708
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:35,440
happy. It should it should not be zero.
 

3709
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,189
happy. It should it should not be zero.
It can't be that nothing nothing had any

3710
01:26:37,189 --> 01:26:37,199
It can't be that nothing nothing had any
 

3711
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:40,070
It can't be that nothing nothing had any
reward. Something something worked.

3712
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:40,080
reward. Something something worked.
 

3713
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,750
reward. Something something worked.
Okay. But if you one thing worked I'm

3714
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:41,760
Okay. But if you one thing worked I'm
 

3715
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,070
Okay. But if you one thing worked I'm
going to use it

3716
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:44,080
going to use it
 

3717
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,189
going to use it
and this is this. Now final things to

3718
01:26:47,189 --> 01:26:47,199
and this is this. Now final things to
 

3719
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:51,430
and this is this. Now final things to
worry about SG min epsilon.

3720
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:51,440
worry about SG min epsilon.
 

3721
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,510
worry about SG min epsilon.
Okay let's look at the sudian side

3722
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:53,520
Okay let's look at the sudian side
 

3723
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,030
Okay let's look at the sudian side
first. min part this says okay I'm going

3724
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:57,040
first. min part this says okay I'm going
 

3725
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,950
first. min part this says okay I'm going
to use this ratio

3726
01:26:58,950 --> 01:26:58,960
to use this ratio
 

3727
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,629
to use this ratio
but

3728
01:27:00,629 --> 01:27:00,639
but
 

3729
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,390
but
but but

3730
01:27:02,390 --> 01:27:02,400
but but
 

3731
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,189
but but
if the probability under training is

3732
01:27:05,189 --> 01:27:05,199
if the probability under training is
 

3733
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:07,750
if the probability under training is
really really low

3734
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:07,760
really really low
 

3735
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,270
really really low
from this than this guy

3736
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:11,280
from this than this guy
 

3737
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:15,590
from this than this guy
don't throw away this sample

3738
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:15,600

 

3739
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,070

okay if you let this probability if you

3740
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:18,080
okay if you let this probability if you
 

3741
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,149
okay if you let this probability if you
this ratio be very small this will give

3742
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:20,159
this ratio be very small this will give
 

3743
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:23,110
this ratio be very small this will give
this no weight in terms of computing a

3744
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:23,120
this no weight in terms of computing a
 

3745
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,310
this no weight in terms of computing a
gradient

3746
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:26,320

 

3747
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:30,310

hold on to them with some minimal weight

3748
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:30,320
hold on to them with some minimal weight
 

3749
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,390
hold on to them with some minimal weight
because there's some useful signal here

3750
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:32,400
because there's some useful signal here
 

3751
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,229
because there's some useful signal here
even though this is unlikely under my

3752
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:34,239
even though this is unlikely under my
 

3753
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:36,229
even though this is unlikely under my
training distribution.

3754
01:27:36,229 --> 01:27:36,239
training distribution.
 

3755
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:41,189
training distribution.
Okay, so this is a lower clip. Don't let

3756
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:41,199
Okay, so this is a lower clip. Don't let
 

3757
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,229
Okay, so this is a lower clip. Don't let
it get too low. But if this probability

3758
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:44,239
it get too low. But if this probability
 

3759
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:47,110
it get too low. But if this probability
is very high in this particular variant,

3760
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:47,120
is very high in this particular variant,
 

3761
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:50,550
is very high in this particular variant,
let it be high. It's fine.

3762
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:50,560
let it be high. It's fine.
 

3763
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,950
let it be high. It's fine.
Go ahead, count it that way. count your

3764
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:52,960
Go ahead, count it that way. count your
 

3765
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,470
Go ahead, count it that way. count your
optimizer taking care of that.

3766
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:56,480
optimizer taking care of that.
 

3767
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,830
optimizer taking care of that.
Remember when you're training in your

3768
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:57,840
Remember when you're training in your
 

3769
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:58,950
Remember when you're training in your
optimizer, you also have gradient

3770
01:27:58,950 --> 01:27:58,960
optimizer, you also have gradient
 

3771
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,950
optimizer, you also have gradient
clipping for your optimizer itself. It's

3772
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:00,960
clipping for your optimizer itself. It's
 

3773
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,229
clipping for your optimizer itself. It's
going to prevent very large gradients

3774
01:28:02,229 --> 01:28:02,239
going to prevent very large gradients
 

3775
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:03,669
going to prevent very large gradients
from hitting. So you just let that be

3776
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:03,679
from hitting. So you just let that be
 

3777
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:06,149
from hitting. So you just let that be
dealt with separately.

3778
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:06,159
dealt with separately.
 

3779
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:11,030
dealt with separately.
Final word SG. What does SG mean?

3780
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:11,040
Final word SG. What does SG mean?
 

3781
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,910
Final word SG. What does SG mean?
>> No, stop gradients.

3782
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:13,920
>> No, stop gradients.
 

3783
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,790
>> No, stop gradients.
Okay.

3784
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:16,800
Okay.
 

3785
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,790
Okay.
So this is I'll make it a different

3786
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:18,800
So this is I'll make it a different
 

3787
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,750
So this is I'll make it a different
letter

3788
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:21,760
letter
 

3789
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,270
letter
stop

3790
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:23,280
stop
 

3791
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,990

gradient. So this is like pytorch. What

3792
01:28:25,990 --> 01:28:26,000
gradient. So this is like pytorch. What
 

3793
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,390
gradient. So this is like pytorch. What
does it mean? It means that remember

3794
01:28:28,390 --> 01:28:28,400
does it mean? It means that remember
 

3795
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,470
does it mean? It means that remember
this is a loss function. You're going to

3796
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
this is a loss function. You're going to
 

3797
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,910
this is a loss function. You're going to
do auto differentiation on this. It says

3798
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:33,920
do auto differentiation on this. It says
 

3799
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:39,030
do auto differentiation on this. It says
I want the auto diff to go inside here.

3800
01:28:39,030 --> 01:28:39,040
I want the auto diff to go inside here.
 

3801
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:40,790
I want the auto diff to go inside here.
This is where I want to go. Like that's

3802
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:40,800
This is where I want to go. Like that's
 

3803
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,350
This is where I want to go. Like that's
what this is. This is where the gradient

3804
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:43,360
what this is. This is where the gradient
 

3805
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,590
what this is. This is where the gradient
goes. This is me correcting

3806
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,600
goes. This is me correcting
 

3807
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,310
goes. This is me correcting
probabilities. Do not let the gradient

3808
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:48,320
probabilities. Do not let the gradient
 

3809
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:52,870
probabilities. Do not let the gradient
go into this.

3810
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:52,880

 

3811
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,229

This is not for the gradient to go into.

3812
01:28:56,229 --> 01:28:56,239
This is not for the gradient to go into.
 

3813
01:28:56,239 --> 01:28:57,910
This is not for the gradient to go into.
Okay,

3814
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:57,920
Okay,
 

3815
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,470
Okay,
this is basically to not do this would

3816
01:29:00,470 --> 01:29:00,480
this is basically to not do this would
 

3817
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:03,110
this is basically to not do this would
be a bug

3818
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:03,120
be a bug
 

3819
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,950
be a bug
because this is you see what I'm saying?

3820
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:04,960
because this is you see what I'm saying?
 

3821
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,510
because this is you see what I'm saying?
This is this is not something that the

3822
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:07,520
This is this is not something that the
 

3823
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,709
This is this is not something that the
derative should be going into. This is

3824
01:29:08,709 --> 01:29:08,719
derative should be going into. This is
 

3825
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:09,990
derative should be going into. This is
just to correct for the fact these two

3826
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,000
just to correct for the fact these two
 

3827
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,310
just to correct for the fact these two
distributions are different.

3828
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:12,320
distributions are different.
 

3829
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:17,510
distributions are different.
Okay, so this approach is what they say

3830
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:17,520
Okay, so this approach is what they say
 

3831
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,590
Okay, so this approach is what they say
works great. I'm out of time. So what I

3832
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:21,600
works great. I'm out of time. So what I
 

3833
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:22,950
works great. I'm out of time. So what I
might do next time is just tell you

3834
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:22,960
might do next time is just tell you
 

3835
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,350
might do next time is just tell you
about KL regularization. And you know

3836
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:25,360
about KL regularization. And you know
 

3837
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,070
about KL regularization. And you know
that's in their recipe. What they find

3838
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:28,080
that's in their recipe. What they find
 

3839
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,950
that's in their recipe. What they find
is that doing KL regularization doesn't

3840
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:30,960
is that doing KL regularization doesn't
 

3841
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,669
is that doing KL regularization doesn't
help. They do experiments and they say

3842
01:29:33,669 --> 01:29:33,679
help. They do experiments and they say
 

3843
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,430
help. They do experiments and they say
it doesn't seem to help. But many times

3844
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:35,440
it doesn't seem to help. But many times
 

3845
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,430
it doesn't seem to help. But many times
you do do KL regularization which you've

3846
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:37,440
you do do KL regularization which you've
 

3847
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,790
you do do KL regularization which you've
already seen in VAE. So I'll just

3848
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:40,800
already seen in VAE. So I'll just
 

3849
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,470
already seen in VAE. So I'll just
mention it last next time before moving

3850
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:42,480
mention it last next time before moving
 

3851
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,750
mention it last next time before moving
on.

3852
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:45,760

 

3853
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,390

Okay. So if you want to think over

3854
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:48,400
Okay. So if you want to think over
 

3855
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:52,229
Okay. So if you want to think over
Thanksgiving you think about why

3856
01:29:52,229 --> 01:29:52,239
Thanksgiving you think about why
 

3857
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:53,750
Thanksgiving you think about why
this thing might also look like

3858
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:53,760
this thing might also look like
 

3859
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,590
this thing might also look like
diffusion generation which we'll talk

3860
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:55,600
diffusion generation which we'll talk
 

3861
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,270
diffusion generation which we'll talk
about next week. I

3862
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:57,280
about next week. I
 

3863
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,870
about next week. I
>> I had a couple questions. First of all

3864
01:29:58,870 --> 01:29:58,880
>> I had a couple questions. First of all
 

3865
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,870
>> I had a couple questions. First of all
for that last equation I was confused

3866
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:00,880
for that last equation I was confused
 

3867
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:05,679
for that last equation I was confused
about you said the min is used
