for not being there in person. Uh try to

50
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
for not being there in person. Uh try to
 

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,910
for not being there in person. Uh try to
deliver the material properly uh

52
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
deliver the material properly uh
 

53
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,749

55
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,789
remotely.
So, we're going to continue our

56
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
So, we're going to continue our
 

57
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,630
So, we're going to continue our
discussion of uh convolutional neur

58
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
discussion of uh convolutional neur
 

59
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,069
discussion of uh convolutional neur
neural nets. The story is as it was

60
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
neural nets. The story is as it was
 

61
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,630
neural nets. The story is as it was
before. Uh you know, we want to do image

62
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
before. Uh you know, we want to do image
 

63
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,069
before. Uh you know, we want to do image
processing. We want to do appropriate

64
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
processing. We want to do appropriate
 

65
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,350
processing. We want to do appropriate
word sharing using the convolutional

66
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
word sharing using the convolutional
 

67
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,190
word sharing using the convolutional
architecture.

68
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
architecture.
 

69
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,870
architecture.
But I realized there's something that I

70
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
But I realized there's something that I
 

71
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,789
But I realized there's something that I
didn't uh uh talk about uh clearly last

72
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
didn't uh uh talk about uh clearly last
 

73
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,389
didn't uh uh talk about uh clearly last
time and I want to make sure it is clear

74
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
time and I want to make sure it is clear
 

75
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,109
time and I want to make sure it is clear
to everybody. So when we think about a k

76
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
to everybody. So when we think about a k
 

77
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,270
to everybody. So when we think about a k
by kcon with c input channels and see

78
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
by kcon with c input channels and see
 

79
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,229
by kcon with c input channels and see
out output channels uh we have two

80
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
out output channels uh we have two
 

81
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,070
out output channels uh we have two
different perspectives on it. Of course

82
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
different perspectives on it. Of course
 

83
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,670
different perspectives on it. Of course
in terms of the computations both

84
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
in terms of the computations both
 

85
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,589
in terms of the computations both
perspectives are identical. Just how do

86
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
perspectives are identical. Just how do
 

87
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,830
perspectives are identical. Just how do
we think about it? The number of

88
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
we think about it? The number of
 

89
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,670
we think about it? The number of
parameters is also identical. you know

90
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
parameters is also identical. you know
 

91
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,150
parameters is also identical. you know
we have k^ squ cnc see out weights and

92
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
we have k^ squ cnc see out weights and
 

93
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,750
we have k^ squ cnc see out weights and
see out biases again as before. So the

94
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
see out biases again as before. So the
 

95
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,869
see out biases again as before. So the
first perspective is the one that we are

96
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
first perspective is the one that we are
 

97
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,589
first perspective is the one that we are
kind of describing. Uh let me make sure

98
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
kind of describing. Uh let me make sure
 

99
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,070
kind of describing. Uh let me make sure
everyone understands it. And the way

100
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
everyone understands it. And the way
 

101
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,070
everyone understands it. And the way
that you think about it is you think

102
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
that you think about it is you think
 

103
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,070
that you think about it is you think
about it as see out different K by K

104
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
about it as see out different K by K
 

105
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,910
about it as see out different K by K
cons each of these K by K cons having C

106
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
cons each of these K by K cons having C
 

107
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,750
cons each of these K by K cons having C
and input channels and one output

108
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
and input channels and one output
 

109
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,270
and input channels and one output
channel.

110
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
channel.
 

111
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,229
channel.
Um why? Because that's the picture uh

112
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
Um why? Because that's the picture uh
 

113
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,869
Um why? Because that's the picture uh
that we see here. Uh hopefully everyone

114
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
that we see here. Uh hopefully everyone
 

115
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,229
that we see here. Uh hopefully everyone
can see this picture. So here we see a

116
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
can see this picture. So here we see a
 

117
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,390
can see this picture. So here we see a
single output

118
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
single output
 

119
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,229
single output
with uh k by k here's three by uh 3x3

120
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
with uh k by k here's three by uh 3x3
 

121
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,470
with uh k by k here's three by uh 3x3
con with uh cn here visually three uh

122
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
con with uh cn here visually three uh
 

123
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,430
con with uh cn here visually three uh
input channels. So again everything

124
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
input channels. So again everything
 

125
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,710
input channels. So again everything
corresponding to a particular location

126
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
corresponding to a particular location
 

127
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,390
corresponding to a particular location
in the output comes from a filter acting

128
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
in the output comes from a filter acting
 

129
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,229
in the output comes from a filter acting
on that centered same location on the

130
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
on that centered same location on the
 

131
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,710
on that centered same location on the
input where the filter has a different

132
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
input where the filter has a different
 

133
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,030
input where the filter has a different
uh 3x3 uh matrix of real valued weights

134
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
uh 3x3 uh matrix of real valued weights
 

135
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,630
uh 3x3 uh matrix of real valued weights
associated with every channel. Those

136
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
associated with every channel. Those
 

137
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,910
associated with every channel. Those
things are all multiplied together and

138
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
things are all multiplied together and
 

139
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,270
things are all multiplied together and
added up add together the bias.

140
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
added up add together the bias.
 

141
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,789
added up add together the bias.
So in this picture we have the following

142
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
So in this picture we have the following
 

143
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,949
So in this picture we have the following
picture for one output channel just

144
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
picture for one output channel just
 

145
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,430
picture for one output channel just
simply repeated see out times to give

146
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
simply repeated see out times to give
 

147
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,270
simply repeated see out times to give
you see out different outputs.

148
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
you see out different outputs.
 

149
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,470
you see out different outputs.
This picture uh is hopefully clear.

150
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
This picture uh is hopefully clear.
 

151
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,190
This picture uh is hopefully clear.
Uh I want to contrast this with a second

152
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
Uh I want to contrast this with a second
 

153
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,789
Uh I want to contrast this with a second
perspective a different perspective.

154
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
perspective a different perspective.
 

155
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,789
perspective a different perspective.
Again the result is the same but it's a

156
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
Again the result is the same but it's a
 

157
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,589
Again the result is the same but it's a
different way of looking at it.

158
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
different way of looking at it.
 

159
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,789
different way of looking at it.
And this uh other perspective says look

160
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
And this uh other perspective says look
 

161
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,149
And this uh other perspective says look
we're going to think about this uh as a

162
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
we're going to think about this uh as a
 

163
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,910
we're going to think about this uh as a
single k by k con except instead of

164
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
single k by k con except instead of
 

165
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,270
single k by k con except instead of
having weight numbers we have weight

166
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
having weight numbers we have weight
 

167
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,470
having weight numbers we have weight
matrices in every box and instead of

168
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
matrices in every box and instead of
 

169
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,030
matrices in every box and instead of
having a bias number a single bias we

170
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
having a bias number a single bias we
 

171
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,870
having a bias number a single bias we
have a bias vector uh in every box

172
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
have a bias vector uh in every box
 

173
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,310
have a bias vector uh in every box
not every box but sort of for for the

174
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
not every box but sort of for for the
 

175
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,350
not every box but sort of for for the
conf. So here's a 3x3 example kind of

176
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
conf. So here's a 3x3 example kind of
 

177
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,110
conf. So here's a 3x3 example kind of
worked out together with the kind of

178
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
worked out together with the kind of
 

179
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,909
worked out together with the kind of
described with the math. So before we

180
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
described with the math. So before we
 

181
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,270
described with the math. So before we
drew this and you thought of each of

182
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
drew this and you thought of each of
 

183
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,909
drew this and you thought of each of
these W's, the one corresponding to the

184
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
these W's, the one corresponding to the
 

185
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,749
these W's, the one corresponding to the
pixel itself, the one corresponding to

186
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
pixel itself, the one corresponding to
 

187
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,629
pixel itself, the one corresponding to
north and so on as all being scalar

188
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
north and so on as all being scalar
 

189
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,990
north and so on as all being scalar
values, real values. Now we think of

190
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
values, real values. Now we think of
 

191
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,749
values, real values. Now we think of
each of these for example let's look at

192
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
each of these for example let's look at
 

193
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,390
each of these for example let's look at
WN. Uh they all all the W's have the

194
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
WN. Uh they all all the W's have the
 

195
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,469
WN. Uh they all all the W's have the
same shape. They are a CN by C out

196
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
same shape. They are a CN by C out
 

197
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,510
same shape. They are a CN by C out
matri. So CN inputs. So CN in this case

198
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
matri. So CN inputs. So CN in this case
 

199
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,590
matri. So CN inputs. So CN in this case
we're using a vector convention of of

200
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
we're using a vector convention of of
 

201
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,110
we're using a vector convention of of
columns. So we have C in columns and C

202
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
columns. So we have C in columns and C
 

203
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,790
columns. So we have C in columns and C
out rows and the bias for the entire

204
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
out rows and the bias for the entire
 

205
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,430
out rows and the bias for the entire
conf is a vector with the seout uh size

206
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
conf is a vector with the seout uh size
 

207
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,110
conf is a vector with the seout uh size
dimension.

208
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
dimension.
 

209
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,469
dimension.
So if you think about it in terms of a

210
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
So if you think about it in terms of a
 

211
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,430
So if you think about it in terms of a
formula what you have is the output

212
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
formula what you have is the output
 

213
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,909
formula what you have is the output
assuming nonlinearity here is just the

214
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
assuming nonlinearity here is just the
 

215
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,310
assuming nonlinearity here is just the
bias. So remember the output is for per

216
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
bias. So remember the output is for per
 

217
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,150
bias. So remember the output is for per
pixel everything is weight shared across

218
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
pixel everything is weight shared across
 

219
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,510
pixel everything is weight shared across
pixels. So a bias vector plus a sum a

220
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
pixels. So a bias vector plus a sum a
 

221
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,310
pixels. So a bias vector plus a sum a
sum over i where i is this whatever this

222
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
sum over i where i is this whatever this
 

223
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,390
sum over i where i is this whatever this
neighborhood structure is. So for a k by

224
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
neighborhood structure is. So for a k by
 

225
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,990
neighborhood structure is. So for a k by
k uh there's k squ terms in the sum 3x3

226
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
k uh there's k squ terms in the sum 3x3
 

227
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,270
k uh there's k squ terms in the sum 3x3
there's nine of the corresponding weight

228
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
there's nine of the corresponding weight
 

229
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,110
there's nine of the corresponding weight
matrix wi acting on the corresponding

230
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
matrix wi acting on the corresponding
 

231
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,230
matrix wi acting on the corresponding
input vector from the uh image at the

232
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
input vector from the uh image at the
 

233
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,870
input vector from the uh image at the
previous level. So this perspective says

234
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
previous level. So this perspective says
 

235
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,990
previous level. So this perspective says
that what happens at cons in connets is

236
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
that what happens at cons in connets is
 

237
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,550
that what happens at cons in connets is
that every you always maintain an image

238
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
that every you always maintain an image
 

239
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,350
that every you always maintain an image
and the entries of every pixel are

240
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
and the entries of every pixel are
 

241
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,510
and the entries of every pixel are
vectors. There were three vectors in the

242
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
vectors. There were three vectors in the
 

243
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,070
vectors. There were three vectors in the
case of RGB and they are whatever

244
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
case of RGB and they are whatever
 

245
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,629
case of RGB and they are whatever
generic vector size we want for deeper

246
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
generic vector size we want for deeper
 

247
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,270
generic vector size we want for deeper
in the network. Okay, I want to pause

248
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
in the network. Okay, I want to pause
 

249
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,590
in the network. Okay, I want to pause
here and just take any questions to make

250
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
here and just take any questions to make
 

251
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,430
here and just take any questions to make
sure people understand these two are

252
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
sure people understand these two are
 

253
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,110
sure people understand these two are
equivalent to each other. They both

254
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
equivalent to each other. They both
 

255
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,550
equivalent to each other. They both
represent a learnable linear uh so aine

256
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
represent a learnable linear uh so aine
 

257
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,070
represent a learnable linear uh so aine
transformation from uh one image to

258
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
transformation from uh one image to
 

259
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,830
transformation from uh one image to
another.

260
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
another.
 

261
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,110
another.
But uh I want to make sure everyone

262
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
But uh I want to make sure everyone
 

263
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,430
But uh I want to make sure everyone
understand these two perspectives.

264
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
understand these two perspectives.
 

265
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,510
understand these two perspectives.
Any questions on this?

266
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520

 

267
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,510

>> Yeah.

268
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520

 

269
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,350

>> I in the summation refer to the number

270
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
>> I in the summation refer to the number
 

271
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,350
>> I in the summation refer to the number
of channels.

272
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
of channels.
 

273
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,670
of channels.
>> Uh great. The question was what does the

274
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
>> Uh great. The question was what does the
 

275
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,110
>> Uh great. The question was what does the
I refer to in the summation? The I is

276
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
I refer to in the summation? The I is
 

277
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,469
I refer to in the summation? The I is
not referring to the number of channels.

278
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
not referring to the number of channels.
 

279
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,670
not referring to the number of channels.
Let me write it out.

280
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680

 

281
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,749

So in this particular sum I

282
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
So in this particular sum I
 

283
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:01,270
So in this particular sum I
this is ranging over

284
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280

 

285
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,469

the A by K

286
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
the A by K
 

287
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,029
the A by K
positions.

288
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
positions.
 

289
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,550
positions.
in

290
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
in
 

291
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,830
in
the con filter.

292
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840

 

293
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,870

Okay, so it's not summing up uh over

294
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
Okay, so it's not summing up uh over
 

295
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,510
Okay, so it's not summing up uh over
channels, it's summing up over spatial

296
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
channels, it's summing up over spatial
 

297
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,110
channels, it's summing up over spatial
positions

298
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
positions
 

299
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,110
positions
here where remember the spatial

300
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
here where remember the spatial
 

301
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,629
here where remember the spatial
position, there's one weight that

302
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
position, there's one weight that
 

303
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,790
position, there's one weight that
corresponds to me, the center of the

304
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
corresponds to me, the center of the
 

305
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,550
corresponds to me, the center of the
filter, and then there's its local

306
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
filter, and then there's its local
 

307
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,070
filter, and then there's its local
neighborhoods.

308
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
neighborhoods.
 

309
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,230
neighborhoods.
So the H out for this pixel is going to

310
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
So the H out for this pixel is going to
 

311
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,270
So the H out for this pixel is going to
be the sum over I the neighborhoods the

312
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
be the sum over I the neighborhoods the
 

313
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,390
be the sum over I the neighborhoods the
3x3 neighborhoods of the weights acting

314
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
3x3 neighborhoods of the weights acting
 

315
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,469
3x3 neighborhoods of the weights acting
on the corresponding pixel in the input.

316
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
on the corresponding pixel in the input.
 

317
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,350
on the corresponding pixel in the input.
So the corresponding pixel here for me

318
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
So the corresponding pixel here for me
 

319
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,230
So the corresponding pixel here for me
is the same exact pixel position. The

320
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
is the same exact pixel position. The
 

321
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,390
is the same exact pixel position. The
one for north, so there's a north in

322
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
one for north, so there's a north in
 

323
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,909
one for north, so there's a north in
here, is the pixel that's one above the

324
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919

331
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,189
right. And for uh sorry, for west, you
know, one to the left. Does that make it

332
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
know, one to the left. Does that make it
 

333
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,749
know, one to the left. Does that make it
clear? Does that answer the question?

334
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
clear? Does that answer the question?
 

335
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,869
clear? Does that answer the question?
>> Yeah.

336
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879

 

337
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,790

>> Yeah.

338
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
>> Yeah.

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,589

>> I can't hear anything right now.

354
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599

 

355
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,110

>> Great. Where in the formula do account

356
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
>> Great. Where in the formula do account
 

357
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,550
>> Great. Where in the formula do account
for the number of channels? The number

358
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
for the number of channels? The number
 

359
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,509
for the number of channels? The number
of channels at the input and the number

360
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
of channels at the input and the number
 

361
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,990
of channels at the input and the number
of channels at the output are accounted

362
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
of channels at the output are accounted
 

363
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,790
of channels at the output are accounted
for by the shapes of these uh vectors

364
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
for by the shapes of these uh vectors
 

365
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,350
for by the shapes of these uh vectors
and matrices. So the number of output

366
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
and matrices. So the number of output
 

367
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,350
and matrices. So the number of output
channels is the size of the bias vector

368
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
channels is the size of the bias vector
 

369
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,350
channels is the size of the bias vector
and it's also the number of rows in the

370
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
and it's also the number of rows in the
 

371
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,670
and it's also the number of rows in the
weight ve weight matrix. The number of

372
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
weight ve weight matrix. The number of
 

373
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,110
weight ve weight matrix. The number of
input channels is CN and that's

374
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
input channels is CN and that's
 

375
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,870
input channels is CN and that's
represented by the number of columns in

376
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
represented by the number of columns in
 

377
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,350
represented by the number of columns in
the weight matrix. This is using the

378
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
the weight matrix. This is using the
 

379
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,350
the weight matrix. This is using the
convention that we think of at every

380
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
convention that we think of at every
 

381
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,750
convention that we think of at every
pixel of the image sits a vector, a

382
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
pixel of the image sits a vector, a
 

383
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,590
pixel of the image sits a vector, a
column vector.

384
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600

 

385
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,750

Does that answer the question?

386
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760

 

387
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,590

>> Yeah, that's good. You can move on. Yes.

388
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
>> Yeah, that's good. You can move on. Yes.
 

389
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,750
>> Yeah, that's good. You can move on. Yes.
>> Okay, great. Thank you. So, now let's go

390
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
>> Okay, great. Thank you. So, now let's go
 

391
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,870
>> Okay, great. Thank you. So, now let's go
back to what we were talking before.

392
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
back to what we were talking before.
 

393
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,070
back to what we were talking before.
We're kind of at the end of last

394
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
We're kind of at the end of last
 

395
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,470
We're kind of at the end of last
lecture. We're talking about uh how to

396
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
lecture. We're talking about uh how to
 

397
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,310
lecture. We're talking about uh how to
make training stable and effective. and

398
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
make training stable and effective. and
 

399
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,150
make training stable and effective. and
we introduced the idea of normalization

400
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
we introduced the idea of normalization
 

401
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,910
we introduced the idea of normalization
layers. So, uh recall the basic story.

402
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
layers. So, uh recall the basic story.
 

403
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,550
layers. So, uh recall the basic story.
We have an uh input that goes through a

404
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
We have an uh input that goes through a
 

405
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,030
We have an uh input that goes through a
deep network and we're afraid of the

406
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
deep network and we're afraid of the
 

407
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,590
deep network and we're afraid of the
activations or the gradients blowing up

408
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
activations or the gradients blowing up
 

409
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,949
activations or the gradients blowing up
as you go through.

410
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
as you go through.
 

411
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:08,310
as you go through.
Is there a question?

412
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320

 

413
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,630

>> I hear some sound. Is that someone

414
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
>> I hear some sound. Is that someone
 

415
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,910
>> I hear some sound. Is that someone
talking?

416
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
talking?
 

417
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,990
talking?
>> I can't hear what they're saying though.

418
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
>> I can't hear what they're saying though.
 

419
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,590
>> I can't hear what they're saying though.
>> H sorry I was trying to figure out the

420
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
>> H sorry I was trying to figure out the
 

421
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,110
>> H sorry I was trying to figure out the
mic but it's clearly picking up not

422
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
mic but it's clearly picking up not
 

423
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,790
mic but it's clearly picking up not
enough. Okay, keep going.

424
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
enough. Okay, keep going.
 

425
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,190
enough. Okay, keep going.
>> Okay.

426
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
>> Okay.
 

427
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,829
>> Okay.
Um so uh if we uh think about you know

428
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
Um so uh if we uh think about you know
 

429
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,069
Um so uh if we uh think about you know
how do we what can we do? We already

430
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
how do we what can we do? We already
 

431
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,829
how do we what can we do? We already
have the idea from our discussions of

432
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
have the idea from our discussions of
 

433
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,829
have the idea from our discussions of
MUP that one thing we might be

434
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
MUP that one thing we might be
 

435
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,230
MUP that one thing we might be
interested in is the RMS norm to keep

436
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
interested in is the RMS norm to keep
 

437
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,150
interested in is the RMS norm to keep
the activations all kind of in the right

438
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
the activations all kind of in the right
 

439
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,710
the activations all kind of in the right
place roughly of you know size one on

440
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
place roughly of you know size one on
 

441
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,389
place roughly of you know size one on
average.

442
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
average.
 

443
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,150
average.
So we could insert uh an RMS normalizing

444
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
So we could insert uh an RMS normalizing
 

445
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,310
So we could insert uh an RMS normalizing
uh layer kind of inside of our network

446
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
uh layer kind of inside of our network
 

447
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,509
uh layer kind of inside of our network
wherever we wanted. And you know what uh

448
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
wherever we wanted. And you know what uh
 

449
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,470
wherever we wanted. And you know what uh
what that would be if there's

450
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
what that would be if there's
 

451
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,949
what that would be if there's
d-dimensional inputs and you want to RMS

452
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
d-dimensional inputs and you want to RMS
 

453
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,269
d-dimensional inputs and you want to RMS
normalize them. We would just take the

454
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
normalize them. We would just take the
 

455
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,870
normalize them. We would just take the
vector and you divide it by the RMS norm

456
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
vector and you divide it by the RMS norm
 

457
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,269
vector and you divide it by the RMS norm
for scaling it down. Right? That's one

458
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
for scaling it down. Right? That's one
 

459
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,150
for scaling it down. Right? That's one
way of doing it. If you want to think

460
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
way of doing it. If you want to think
 

461
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,750
way of doing it. If you want to think
about in terms of two norm, you can take

462
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
about in terms of two norm, you can take
 

463
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,230
about in terms of two norm, you can take
the vector and divide it by the two norm

464
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
the vector and divide it by the two norm
 

465
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,750
the vector and divide it by the two norm
again plus an epsilon. I forgot the

466
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
again plus an epsilon. I forgot the
 

467
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,990
again plus an epsilon. I forgot the
epsilon in the second expression here

468
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
epsilon in the second expression here
 

469
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,750
epsilon in the second expression here
where general deep learning rule

470
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
where general deep learning rule
 

471
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,030
where general deep learning rule
whenever you're dividing by something

472
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
whenever you're dividing by something
 

473
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,430
whenever you're dividing by something
make sure it's not zero so add a little

474
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
make sure it's not zero so add a little
 

475
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,389
make sure it's not zero so add a little
epsilon to make sure that doesn't happen

476
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
epsilon to make sure that doesn't happen
 

477
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,350
epsilon to make sure that doesn't happen
division by zero don't happen

478
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
division by zero don't happen
 

479
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,870
division by zero don't happen
and then we said okay let's think about

480
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
and then we said okay let's think about
 

481
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,590
and then we said okay let's think about
images again what are choices we can do

482
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
images again what are choices we can do
 

483
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,110
images again what are choices we can do
and I wanted to talk about batch norm

484
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
and I wanted to talk about batch norm
 

485
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,150
and I wanted to talk about batch norm
that's where we were last time

486
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
that's where we were last time
 

487
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,550
that's where we were last time
so for batchorm

488
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
so for batchorm
 

489
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,910
so for batchorm
uh one way to think about it is to say

490
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
uh one way to think about it is to say
 

491
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,910
uh one way to think about it is to say
that we would like to do input

492
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
that we would like to do input
 

493
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,430
that we would like to do input
standardization

494
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
standardization
 

495
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,069
standardization
for each of the channels that are coming

496
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
for each of the channels that are coming
 

497
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,590
for each of the channels that are coming
in.

498
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
in.
 

499
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,870
in.
So we don't have access to the entire

500
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
So we don't have access to the entire
 

501
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,389
So we don't have access to the entire
training input. It's just too big. Uh we

502
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
training input. It's just too big. Uh we
 

503
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,230
training input. It's just too big. Uh we
can't premp compute this in advance

504
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
can't premp compute this in advance
 

505
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,190
can't premp compute this in advance
because the network will keep evolving

506
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
because the network will keep evolving
 

507
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,790
because the network will keep evolving
and so the output at the hidden layer

508
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
and so the output at the hidden layer
 

509
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,790
and so the output at the hidden layer
will keep changing. So we have to work

510
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
will keep changing. So we have to work
 

511
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,910
will keep changing. So we have to work
on the current batch.

512
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
on the current batch.
 

513
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,069
on the current batch.
So what we do is we can imagine just

514
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:08,079
So what we do is we can imagine just
 

515
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,910
So what we do is we can imagine just
doing averaging over the current batch.

516
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
doing averaging over the current batch.
 

517
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,670
doing averaging over the current batch.
So what this does is this applies a

518
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
So what this does is this applies a
 

519
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,069
So what this does is this applies a
different uh normalizing in terms of

520
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,079
different uh normalizing in terms of
 

521
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,430
different uh normalizing in terms of
recentering and uh scaling for every

522
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
recentering and uh scaling for every
 

523
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,550
recentering and uh scaling for every
channel of the input.

524
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
channel of the input.
 

525
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,150
channel of the input.
So now the question becomes how do you

526
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
So now the question becomes how do you
 

527
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,949
So now the question becomes how do you
compute what that recentering should be?

528
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
compute what that recentering should be?
 

529
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,949
compute what that recentering should be?
So in this particular formula from last

530
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
So in this particular formula from last
 

531
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,949
So in this particular formula from last
time that recentering is to subtract n.

532
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
time that recentering is to subtract n.
 

533
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,750
time that recentering is to subtract n.
The n is a kind of empirical mean. So

534
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
The n is a kind of empirical mean. So
 

535
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,829
The n is a kind of empirical mean. So
you're averaging together over some b

536
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
you're averaging together over some b
 

537
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,590
you're averaging together over some b
some set which is what's to be averaged

538
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
some set which is what's to be averaged
 

539
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,430
some set which is what's to be averaged
over. This is how you can think about it

540
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
over. This is how you can think about it
 

541
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,670
over. This is how you can think about it
working.

542
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
working.
 

543
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,190
working.
And the scaling is done by some s which

544
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
And the scaling is done by some s which
 

545
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,190
And the scaling is done by some s which
is again based on what's averaged over.

546
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
is again based on what's averaged over.
 

547
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,190
is again based on what's averaged over.
So this is like input standardization

548
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
So this is like input standardization
 

549
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,550
So this is like input standardization
that you saw in your machine learning

550
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,560
that you saw in your machine learning
 

551
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,310
that you saw in your machine learning
class except we're doing it on a batch

552
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
class except we're doing it on a batch
 

553
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,310
class except we're doing it on a batch
by batch basis and we're doing it at the

554
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
by batch basis and we're doing it at the
 

555
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,910
by batch basis and we're doing it at the
at a hidden layer instead of at the

556
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
at a hidden layer instead of at the
 

557
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,190
at a hidden layer instead of at the
inputs themselves.

558
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
inputs themselves.
 

559
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,509
inputs themselves.
So this how far we got last time and at

560
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
So this how far we got last time and at
 

561
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,590
So this how far we got last time and at
the very end I said that what people

562
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:09,600
the very end I said that what people
 

563
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,629
the very end I said that what people
sometimes do is they add learnable

564
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
sometimes do is they add learnable
 

565
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,470
sometimes do is they add learnable
parameters a gamma and a delta that

566
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
parameters a gamma and a delta that
 

567
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,310
parameters a gamma and a delta that
basically reflect the following

568
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
basically reflect the following
 

569
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,829
basically reflect the following
question. what should I be standardizing

570
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
question. what should I be standardizing
 

571
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,670
question. what should I be standardizing
to?

572
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
to?
 

573
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,750
to?
And we can say I should standardize to

574
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
And we can say I should standardize to
 

575
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,150
And we can say I should standardize to
zero mean and uh variance one or you can

576
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
zero mean and uh variance one or you can
 

577
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,269
zero mean and uh variance one or you can
say I don't know. And in general if you

578
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
say I don't know. And in general if you
 

579
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,590
say I don't know. And in general if you
don't know something in deep learning

580
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
don't know something in deep learning
 

581
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,030
don't know something in deep learning
you make the thing you don't know into a

582
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
you make the thing you don't know into a
 

583
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,870
you make the thing you don't know into a
learnable parameter and then

584
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
learnable parameter and then
 

585
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,150
learnable parameter and then
in this case if these are learnable

586
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
in this case if these are learnable
 

587
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,550
in this case if these are learnable
parameters you you know default them at

588
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
parameters you you know default them at
 

589
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:56,470
parameters you you know default them at
let me write that down. So learnable

590
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,480

 

591
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,110

center

592
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
center
 

593
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,269
center
delta and scale

594
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
delta and scale
 

595
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,790
delta and scale
gamma.

596
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
gamma.
 

597
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,230
gamma.
So we initialize

598
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240

 

599
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,790

to

600
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
to
 

601
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,829
to
zero, the center to zero, and the scale

602
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
zero, the center to zero, and the scale
 

603
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,910
zero, the center to zero, and the scale
gamma to one. But then you let these get

604
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
gamma to one. But then you let these get
 

605
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,790
gamma to one. But then you let these get
updated in gradient descent, whichever

606
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
updated in gradient descent, whichever
 

607
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,310
updated in gradient descent, whichever
optimizer we're using.

608
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
optimizer we're using.
 

609
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,110
optimizer we're using.
Okay, so

610
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
Okay, so
 

611
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,790
Okay, so
uh let's make sure everyone is

612
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
uh let's make sure everyone is
 

613
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,550
uh let's make sure everyone is
understanding what's uh what's going on

614
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
understanding what's uh what's going on
 

615
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,470
understanding what's uh what's going on
here.

616
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
here.
 

617
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,790
here.
Uh, I can't hear you if you're saying

618
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
Uh, I can't hear you if you're saying
 

619
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,990
Uh, I can't hear you if you're saying
something.

620
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000

 

621
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,430

I still can't hear you if you're saying

622
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
I still can't hear you if you're saying
 

623
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:50,230
I still can't hear you if you're saying
something.

624
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240

 

625
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,629

>> Can you hear this?

626
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639

 

627
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,470

>> No. Okay. Uh, can you hear me now?

628
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
>> No. Okay. Uh, can you hear me now?
 

629
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,670
>> No. Okay. Uh, can you hear me now?
>> Yeah, now I can hear you.

630
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
>> Yeah, now I can hear you.
 

631
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,670
>> Yeah, now I can hear you.
>> Okay. It's very very directional

632
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
>> Okay. It's very very directional
 

633
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,990
>> Okay. It's very very directional
microphone. Okay. Um, can you zoom in?

634
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,000
microphone. Okay. Um, can you zoom in?
 

635
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,949
microphone. Okay. Um, can you zoom in?
It's hard to see what's being written.

636
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:06,959
It's hard to see what's being written.
 

637
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,550
It's hard to see what's being written.
>> Okay. Is that better?

638
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
>> Okay. Is that better?
 

639
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,910
>> Okay. Is that better?
>> Yes, but now we're losing the whole

640
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920
>> Yes, but now we're losing the whole
 

641
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,590
>> Yes, but now we're losing the whole
slide. So, you need to maybe kill the

642
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,600
slide. So, you need to maybe kill the
 

643
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,829
slide. So, you need to maybe kill the
sidebar.

644
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839

 

645
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,069

>> Good point. Kill the sidebar.

646
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
>> Good point. Kill the sidebar.
 

647
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,509
>> Good point. Kill the sidebar.
>> Zoom out. Zoom out. Zoom out more. Yeah,

648
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
>> Zoom out. Zoom out. Zoom out more. Yeah,
 

649
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,269
>> Zoom out. Zoom out. Zoom out more. Yeah,
better.

650
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
better.
 

651
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,310
better.
>> Okay. Thank you.

652
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320

 

653
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,550

So there's a couple of comments on uh

654
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
So there's a couple of comments on uh
 

655
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,910
So there's a couple of comments on uh
these kind of learnable parameters.

656
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:35,920
these kind of learnable parameters.
 

657
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,110
these kind of learnable parameters.
So typically

658
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120

 

659
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:49,030

>> we

660
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040

 

661
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:59,590

we don't use weight decay.

662
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600

 

663
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,949

and then these parameters

664
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959

 

665
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,350

and if you are going to use weight decay

666
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
and if you are going to use weight decay
 

667
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,110
and if you are going to use weight decay
uh you you see that the paper you're

668
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
uh you you see that the paper you're
 

669
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,110
uh you you see that the paper you're
following does use weight decay for it

670
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,120
following does use weight decay for it
 

671
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,470
following does use weight decay for it
then of course you can always follow

672
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
then of course you can always follow
 

673
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,910
then of course you can always follow
them but between the two of them

674
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:15,920
them but between the two of them
 

675
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,990
them but between the two of them
we we don't like to use weight g weight

676
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
we we don't like to use weight g weight
 

677
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,269
we we don't like to use weight g weight
decay in particular for the gamma

678
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
decay in particular for the gamma
 

679
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,790
decay in particular for the gamma
because having it go to zero isn't

680
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
because having it go to zero isn't
 

681
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,069
because having it go to zero isn't
really a reasonable thing that we want

682
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
really a reasonable thing that we want
 

683
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,030
really a reasonable thing that we want
to have happen.

684
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
to have happen.
 

685
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,350
to have happen.
But that's just a a a piece of the

686
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
But that's just a a a piece of the
 

687
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,509
But that's just a a a piece of the
empirical advice that people follow.

688
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519

 

689
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,110

Okay.

690
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
Okay.
 

691
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,110
Okay.
So this is how

692
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
So this is how
 

693
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,030
So this is how
batch norm

694
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
batch norm
 

695
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,749
batch norm
uh batch norm works and

696
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
uh batch norm works and
 

697
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,470
uh batch norm works and
what you do. So the other comment here

698
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
what you do. So the other comment here
 

699
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,189
what you do. So the other comment here
is that all of these operations are

700
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
is that all of these operations are
 

701
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,710
is that all of these operations are
differentiable.

702
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
differentiable.
 

703
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,150
differentiable.
You know adding things up is

704
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160
You know adding things up is
 

705
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,990
You know adding things up is
differentiable.

706
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
differentiable.
 

707
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,509
differentiable.
Adding up taking squares is

708
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
Adding up taking squares is
 

709
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,630
Adding up taking squares is
differentiable. Adding up a bunch of

710
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:04,640
differentiable. Adding up a bunch of
 

711
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,909
differentiable. Adding up a bunch of
squares is differentiable. Taking a

712
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
squares is differentiable. Taking a
 

713
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,750
squares is differentiable. Taking a
square root is differentiable. And so

714
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
square root is differentiable. And so
 

715
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,590
square root is differentiable. And so
for all of these there's nothing here

716
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
for all of these there's nothing here
 

717
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,069
for all of these there's nothing here
that stops back prop from going in and

718
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
that stops back prop from going in and
 

719
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,789
that stops back prop from going in and
adjusting what's going on. So if we

720
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
adjusting what's going on. So if we
 

721
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,470
adjusting what's going on. So if we
insert these kind of batch norm layers.

722
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,480
insert these kind of batch norm layers.
 

723
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,829
insert these kind of batch norm layers.
So what we do?

724
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839

 

725
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,510

Oops.

726
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520

 

727
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:34,630

We insert normalization errors

728
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640

 

729
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,789

in between.

730
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799

 

731
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,110

So it's a part of the architecture of

732
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
So it's a part of the architecture of
 

733
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,750
So it's a part of the architecture of
where these normalization layers go.

734
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760
where these normalization layers go.
 

735
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,029
where these normalization layers go.
You don't have to insert them between

736
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
You don't have to insert them between
 

737
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,110
You don't have to insert them between
every two layers, but uh they're in

738
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
every two layers, but uh they're in
 

739
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,190
every two layers, but uh they're in
they're put in. We'll talk more about

740
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
they're put in. We'll talk more about
 

741
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,110
they're put in. We'll talk more about
exactly how they're the current best

742
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
exactly how they're the current best
 

743
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,789
exactly how they're the current best
practices for putting in normalization

744
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799
practices for putting in normalization
 

745
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,549
practices for putting in normalization
layers later after we've also introduced

746
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
layers later after we've also introduced
 

747
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,470
layers later after we've also introduced
residual connections, but here I just

748
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,480
residual connections, but here I just
 

749
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,830
residual connections, but here I just
want you to understand we put them in

750
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
want you to understand we put them in
 

751
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,710
want you to understand we put them in
between.

752
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
between.
 

753
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,789
between.
Okay.

754
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
Okay.
 

755
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,870
Okay.
So hopefully the basic issue of how

756
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:04,880
So hopefully the basic issue of how
 

757
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,870
So hopefully the basic issue of how
bashnorm works during training is clear.

758
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
bashnorm works during training is clear.
 

759
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,590
bashnorm works during training is clear.
Okay. So now I want to I'll come I'll

760
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
Okay. So now I want to I'll come I'll
 

761
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,029
Okay. So now I want to I'll come I'll
come back to other norms. There's a

762
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
come back to other norms. There's a
 

763
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:13,350
come back to other norms. There's a
question

764
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
question
 

765
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,150
question
>> in a moment.

766
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,160

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,150
>> There's a question.

770
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
>> Great.
 

771
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,470
>> Great.
>> What are the What is that indexing in

775
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,830
the square brackets next to H in the

777
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,990
final? It's like H equals
>> Ah, great. Let me make that more clear.

778
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
>> Ah, great. Let me make that more clear.
 

779
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,710
>> Ah, great. Let me make that more clear.
Sorry about that.

780
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:32,720

 

781
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,190

First, let me erase this latencies.

782
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200

 

783
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,230

Yeah.

784
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240

 

785
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,470

So

786
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
So
 

787
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,630
So
there's some pixel position we're

788
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:46,640
there's some pixel position we're
 

789
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,510
there's some pixel position we're
talking about. Okay. So we're talking

790
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
talking about. Okay. So we're talking
 

791
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,669
talking about. Okay. So we're talking
about h out at position i, comm, j in

792
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
about h out at position i, comm, j in
 

793
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,750
about h out at position i, comm, j in
the image. And that uses the

794
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
the image. And that uses the
 

795
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,510
the image. And that uses the
corresponding i, comma, j in the input.

796
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
corresponding i, comma, j in the input.
 

797
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,630
corresponding i, comma, j in the input.
But every position in the image gets the

798
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
But every position in the image gets the
 

799
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,230
But every position in the image gets the
same

800
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
same
 

801
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:14,470
same
uh mean m and the same scaling s.

802
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480

 

803
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,990

Okay.

804
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay.
 

805
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,350
Okay.
Is that uh clear to everybody now?

806
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,360
Is that uh clear to everybody now?
 

807
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,590
Is that uh clear to everybody now?
>> Yes.

808
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
>> Yes.
 

809
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,190
>> Yes.
>> Yeah. Good question.

810
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200

 

811
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,789

>> Okay. So, uh we've talked about batchorm

812
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:26,799
>> Okay. So, uh we've talked about batchorm
 

813
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,710
>> Okay. So, uh we've talked about batchorm
during training. Hopefully, this is

814
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
during training. Hopefully, this is
 

815
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,110
during training. Hopefully, this is
clear to everyone. We will come back to

816
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
clear to everyone. We will come back to
 

817
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,230
clear to everyone. We will come back to
the question in in just a moment of how

818
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240
the question in in just a moment of how
 

819
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,470
the question in in just a moment of how
do you use it during actual use or

820
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
do you use it during actual use or
 

821
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,150
do you use it during actual use or
testing. But for now, we just make sure

822
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
testing. But for now, we just make sure
 

823
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,350
testing. But for now, we just make sure
we understand training and talk about

824
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
we understand training and talk about
 

825
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,870
we understand training and talk about
some

826
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
some
 

827
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,710
some
talk about another very important norm

828
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
talk about another very important norm
 

829
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,510
talk about another very important norm
uh next.

830
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
uh next.
 

831
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,310
uh next.
Okay. So this is one choice. So remember

832
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:48,320
Okay. So this is one choice. So remember
 

833
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,390
Okay. So this is one choice. So remember
the choice here is what we average over.

834
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
the choice here is what we average over.
 

835
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,750
the choice here is what we average over.
But there's another choice that we can

836
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
But there's another choice that we can
 

837
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,669
But there's another choice that we can
average over. So I'll talk about the

838
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
average over. So I'll talk about the
 

839
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,590
average over. So I'll talk about the
other choice

840
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
other choice
 

841
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,430
other choice
different color green.

842
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440

 

843
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,029

So

844
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
So
 

845
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,230
So
this is uh black is batchorm. So in

846
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:06,240
this is uh black is batchorm. So in
 

847
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:14,230
this is uh black is batchorm. So in
green we'll talk about layer norm.

848
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240

 

849
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,909

So what layer norm does is it's just

850
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
So what layer norm does is it's just
 

851
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,990
So what layer norm does is it's just
like batchorm except what you average

852
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
like batchorm except what you average
 

853
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,470
like batchorm except what you average
over is slightly different. You still

854
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480
over is slightly different. You still
 

855
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,430
over is slightly different. You still
average over the entire image

856
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
average over the entire image
 

857
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,710
average over the entire image
but in instead of averaging over batches

858
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
but in instead of averaging over batches
 

859
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:41,110
but in instead of averaging over batches
you average over channels.

860
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:41,120

 

861
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,070

Okay. So this

862
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,080

 

863
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,070

coverage

864
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
coverage
 

865
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,510
coverage
over space

866
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
over space
 

867
00:20:51,520 --> 00:21:00,310
over space
and channels.

868
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,320

 

869
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,310

Okay. So now when you average over uh

870
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
Okay. So now when you average over uh
 

871
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,390
Okay. So now when you average over uh
space and channels you don't have to

872
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
space and channels you don't have to
 

873
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,510
space and channels you don't have to
worry about batch what the batch size is

874
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
worry about batch what the batch size is
 

875
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,270
worry about batch what the batch size is
you can you can use this with batch size

876
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
you can you can use this with batch size
 

877
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,830
you can you can use this with batch size
one. So that's one motivation for using

878
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
one. So that's one motivation for using
 

879
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,070
one. So that's one motivation for using
layerorm is that in some situations

880
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
layerorm is that in some situations
 

881
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,990
layerorm is that in some situations
you're you can't afford to have very

882
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
you're you can't afford to have very
 

883
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,830
you're you can't afford to have very
large batches and layerorm doesn't need

884
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
large batches and layerorm doesn't need
 

885
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,350
large batches and layerorm doesn't need
very large batches. It just uses batch

886
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
very large batches. It just uses batch
 

887
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,350
very large batches. It just uses batch
size one.

888
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
size one.
 

889
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,630
size one.
It's fine. You can also use a larger

890
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
It's fine. You can also use a larger
 

891
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,789
It's fine. You can also use a larger
batch. If you use a larger batch the

892
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
batch. If you use a larger batch the
 

893
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,630
batch. If you use a larger batch the
layer norm applies separately to every

894
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
layer norm applies separately to every
 

895
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,270
layer norm applies separately to every
single thing in the batch. It doesn't

896
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,280
single thing in the batch. It doesn't
 

897
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,430
single thing in the batch. It doesn't
mix them together in any way.

898
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
mix them together in any way.
 

899
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,669
mix them together in any way.
Okay, any questions on layer norm

900
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
Okay, any questions on layer norm
 

901
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,070
Okay, any questions on layer norm
mechanic loop? So all that changes is

902
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
mechanic loop? So all that changes is
 

903
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,029
mechanic loop? So all that changes is
what this uh curly B is

904
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
what this uh curly B is
 

905
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,149
what this uh curly B is
instead of being space and batch it

906
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,159
instead of being space and batch it
 

907
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,110
instead of being space and batch it
becomes but holding the channel fixed it

908
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
becomes but holding the channel fixed it
 

909
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,950
becomes but holding the channel fixed it
becomes space and channel but holding

910
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
becomes space and channel but holding
 

911
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,669
becomes space and channel but holding
the index into the batch fixed.

912
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,679

 

913
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,190

Okay. Any questions on how what lairm

914
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
Okay. Any questions on how what lairm
 

915
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,390
Okay. Any questions on how what lairm
is?

916
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
is?
 

917
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,070
is?
>> We're good.

918
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,080
>> We're good.
 

919
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,830
>> We're good.
>> We're good. Okay. Now

920
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
>> We're good. Okay. Now
 

921
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,350
>> We're good. Okay. Now
in uh in layer, so that's some more

922
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
in uh in layer, so that's some more
 

923
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,110
in uh in layer, so that's some more
comments about lairm.

924
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120

 

925
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,990

So in layer and arm

926
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,000

 

927
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,430

we have

928
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,440

 

929
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,950

can have

930
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:28,960

 

931
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,990

different

932
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000

 

933
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,990

gamma

934
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,000
gamma
 

935
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,029
gamma
and delta

936
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
and delta
 

937
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,710
and delta
per channel.

938
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:42,720

 

939
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,190

So you can have separate learnable uh

940
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,200
So you can have separate learnable uh
 

941
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,830
So you can have separate learnable uh
gamas and deltas per channels. Uh

942
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:47,840
gamas and deltas per channels. Uh
 

943
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,230
gamas and deltas per channels. Uh
because you're looking at in layer norm

944
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
because you're looking at in layer norm
 

945
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,390
because you're looking at in layer norm
you're averaging over

946
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
you're averaging over
 

947
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,830
you're averaging over
uh everything in the in the channel.

948
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
uh everything in the in the channel.
 

949
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,230
uh everything in the in the channel.
This still makes sense

950
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
This still makes sense
 

951
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,950
This still makes sense
to have different ones.

952
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
to have different ones.
 

953
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,990
to have different ones.
But in in batchorm you can have

954
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,000
But in in batchorm you can have
 

955
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,870
But in in batchorm you can have
different uh gamas and deltas per

956
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880
different uh gamas and deltas per
 

957
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,270
different uh gamas and deltas per
channel but it happens more organically

958
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,280
channel but it happens more organically
 

959
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,029
channel but it happens more organically
because you're only averaging the the

960
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,039
because you're only averaging the the
 

961
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,789
because you're only averaging the the
averaging domain itself is not over this

962
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
averaging domain itself is not over this
 

963
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,310
averaging domain itself is not over this
but in there you can still have

964
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
but in there you can still have
 

965
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,870
but in there you can still have
different uh gamas and deltas per

966
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
different uh gamas and deltas per
 

967
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,470
different uh gamas and deltas per
channel.

968
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,480

 

969
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,470

Okay hopefully that's uh clear to

970
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,480
Okay hopefully that's uh clear to
 

971
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,350
Okay hopefully that's uh clear to
everybody.

972
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
everybody.
 

973
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,070
everybody.
So in this uh family the two big ones

974
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
So in this uh family the two big ones
 

975
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,350
So in this uh family the two big ones
are uh batch norm and layer norm. And

976
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:31,360
are uh batch norm and layer norm. And
 

977
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,070
are uh batch norm and layer norm. And
when you talk about RMS norm

978
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080

comment here

980
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559

 

981
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,870

RMS norms

982
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
RMS norms
 

983
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,070
RMS norms
layers

984
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080

 

985
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,830

don't recenter.

986
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840

 

987
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:09,110

Never compute.

988
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,120

 

989
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,510

Now we've talked about these kinds of

990
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
Now we've talked about these kinds of
 

991
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,070
Now we've talked about these kinds of
norms. There are others. Uh there's

992
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,080
norms. There are others. Uh there's
 

993
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,430
norms. There are others. Uh there's
other norms that you can get. Basically,

994
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:15,440
other norms that you can get. Basically,
 

995
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,549
other norms that you can get. Basically,
you look at this box. This box is the

996
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
you look at this box. This box is the
 

997
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,470
you look at this box. This box is the
range of possibilities you have of what

998
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
range of possibilities you have of what
 

999
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,470
range of possibilities you have of what
you can do

1000
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
you can do
 

1001
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,950
you can do
in this box. So the easiest ones are to

1002
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
in this box. So the easiest ones are to
 

1003
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,750
in this box. So the easiest ones are to
average across channels or average

1004
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,760
average across channels or average
 

1005
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,390
average across channels or average
across batches.

1006
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,400
across batches.
 

1007
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,669
across batches.
But you can also choose to not average

1008
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
But you can also choose to not average
 

1009
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,830
But you can also choose to not average
across either channels um or batches and

1010
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:37,840
across either channels um or batches and
 

1011
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,630
across either channels um or batches and
only do space.

1012
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,640
only do space.
 

1013
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,070
only do space.
You could you could imagine doing

1014
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
You could you could imagine doing
 

1015
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,149
You could you could imagine doing
something like this.

1016
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
something like this.
 

1017
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:51,830
something like this.
I use this

1018
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840

 

1019
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,230

and average for every just for across

1020
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
and average for every just for across
 

1021
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:02,710
and average for every just for across
space alone.

1022
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720

 

1023
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:18,630

Instance norm

1024
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640

 

1025
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,390

cross space only.

1026
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,400

 

1027
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,149

Okay. Before I talk about the special

1028
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:28,159
Okay. Before I talk about the special
 

1029
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,590
Okay. Before I talk about the special
issue of how to deal with the

1030
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
issue of how to deal with the
 

1031
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,510
issue of how to deal with the
batch norm at inference time, any

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
batch norm at inference time, any
 

1033
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,590
batch norm at inference time, any
questions on the sort of range of

00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
questions on the sort of range of
 

1035
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,110
questions on the sort of range of

1036
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,120
possibilities one has about doing these
 

1037
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,630
possibilities one has about doing these
norms? There's many more. I've just

1038
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
norms? There's many more. I've just
 

1039
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,230
norms? There's many more. I've just
chosen three to describe to you. Batch

1040
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,240
chosen three to describe to you. Batch
 

1041
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,669
chosen three to describe to you. Batch
norm layer norm uh and instance norm and

1042
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:43,679
norm layer norm uh and instance norm and
 

1043
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,830
norm layer norm uh and instance norm and
there's and there the RMS variant where

1044
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
there's and there the RMS variant where
 

1045
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,950
there's and there the RMS variant where
you don't do recentering. But are there

1046
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:48,960
you don't do recentering. But are there
 

1047
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,630
you don't do recentering. But are there
any questions on this normalization?

1048
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
any questions on this normalization?
 

1049
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,470
any questions on this normalization?
>> Question. Yeah, one quick question about

1050
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:52,480
>> Question. Yeah, one quick question about
 

1051
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,590
>> Question. Yeah, one quick question about
the note um on RMS normal layers. Is

1052
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:55,600
the note um on RMS normal layers. Is
 

1053
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,310
the note um on RMS normal layers. Is
that a different kind of normalization

1054
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
that a different kind of normalization
 

1055
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,029
that a different kind of normalization
or are you just saying that if we wanted

1056
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
or are you just saying that if we wanted
 

1057
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,789
or are you just saying that if we wanted
to also

1058
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:02,799
to also
 

1059
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,669
to also
um like if if we omit the M in either

1060
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:05,679
um like if if we omit the M in either
 

1061
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,430
um like if if we omit the M in either
layer norm or batch norm that makes it

1062
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
layer norm or batch norm that makes it
 

1063
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,310
layer norm or batch norm that makes it
an RMS norm.

1064
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
an RMS norm.
 

1065
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,870
an RMS norm.
>> Yes. Uh basically the you can think of

1066
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:12,880
>> Yes. Uh basically the you can think of
 

1067
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,630
>> Yes. Uh basically the you can think of
it as the latter. When people talk about

1068
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:14,640
it as the latter. When people talk about
 

1069
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,710
it as the latter. When people talk about
doing RMS norm what they mean is I want

1070
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
doing RMS norm what they mean is I want
 

1071
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,070
doing RMS norm what they mean is I want
to do the norm except I don't want to do

1072
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
to do the norm except I don't want to do
 

1073
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,909
to do the norm except I don't want to do
an AMP. I don't want to do a recentering

1074
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
an AMP. I don't want to do a recentering
 

1075
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,390
an AMP. I don't want to do a recentering
amp. So I can think about an RMS norm

1076
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:22,400
amp. So I can think about an RMS norm
 

1077
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,430
amp. So I can think about an RMS norm
style for bashnorm or an RMS norm style

1078
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,440
style for bashnorm or an RMS norm style
 

1079
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,750
style for bashnorm or an RMS norm style
for layerm. Typically however it's done

1080
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
for layerm. Typically however it's done
 

1081
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,269
for layerm. Typically however it's done
in the layerorm style.

1082
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
in the layerorm style.
 

1083
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,269
in the layerorm style.
>> Got it. And then add a quick followup.

1084
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:31,279
>> Got it. And then add a quick followup.
 

1085
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,230
>> Got it. And then add a quick followup.
Um for so just to clarify so for batch

1086
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,240
Um for so just to clarify so for batch
 

1087
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,630
Um for so just to clarify so for batch
norm then we have one mean one standard

1088
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
norm then we have one mean one standard
 

1089
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,510
norm then we have one mean one standard
deviation per channel and then for layer

1090
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,520
deviation per channel and then for layer
 

1091
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,430
deviation per channel and then for layer
norm we have one mean one standard

1092
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,440
norm we have one mean one standard
 

1093
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,430
norm we have one mean one standard
deviation per item input element etc in

1094
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:45,440
deviation per item input element etc in
 

1095
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,350
deviation per item input element etc in
the batch. Is that the right way to

1096
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,360
the batch. Is that the right way to
 

1097
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,789
the batch. Is that the right way to
think about it?

1098
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:48,799
think about it?
 

1099
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,430
think about it?
Okay, that's excellent point. So, one of

1100
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,440
Okay, that's excellent point. So, one of
 

1101
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,430
Okay, that's excellent point. So, one of
the things that is a is a constant

1102
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,440
the things that is a is a constant
 

1103
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,870
the things that is a is a constant
everywhere uh in all systems is that you

1104
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
everywhere uh in all systems is that you
 

1105
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,950
everywhere uh in all systems is that you
you don't have a different learnable

1106
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
you don't have a different learnable
 

1107
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,350
you don't have a different learnable
parameter across your batch. So,

1108
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
parameter across your batch. So,
 

1109
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,190
parameter across your batch. So,
learnable parameters are always shared

1110
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
learnable parameters are always shared
 

1111
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,310
learnable parameters are always shared
across the batch. However, in the

1112
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:06,320
across the batch. However, in the
 

1113
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,190
across the batch. However, in the
context of doing this computation of

1114
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,200
context of doing this computation of
 

1115
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,909
context of doing this computation of
computing the M or the S, uh for layer,

1116
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:13,919
computing the M or the S, uh for layer,
 

1117
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,590
computing the M or the S, uh for layer,
you compute a different M and a

1118
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
you compute a different M and a
 

1119
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,630
you compute a different M and a
different S uh for different things in

1120
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:18,640
different S uh for different things in
 

1121
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,230
different S uh for different things in
the batch. Whereas for bashnorm, you

1122
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,240
the batch. Whereas for bashnorm, you
 

1123
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,870
the batch. Whereas for bashnorm, you
compute a single M and a single S for

1124
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:22,880
compute a single M and a single S for
 

1125
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,310
compute a single M and a single S for
different things across the batch.

1126
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,320
different things across the batch.
 

1127
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,029
different things across the batch.
However, in batchorm, you compute a

1128
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,039
However, in batchorm, you compute a
 

1129
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,029
However, in batchorm, you compute a
different M and a different S across

1130
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,039
different M and a different S across
 

1131
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,710
different M and a different S across
channels. Whereas uh in layerorm you

1132
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
channels. Whereas uh in layerorm you
 

1133
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,230
channels. Whereas uh in layerorm you
just compute different m and different

1134
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,240
just compute different m and different
 

1135
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,630
just compute different m and different
s's across that truth. Does that answer

1136
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,640
s's across that truth. Does that answer
 

1137
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,350
s's across that truth. Does that answer

you can have different like learnable
 

1151
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,029
you can have different like learnable

1152
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
parameters per channel. Did you mean
 

1153
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,830
parameters per channel. Did you mean
batches or do you mean like there's

1154
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:53,840
batches or do you mean like there's
 

1155
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,669
batches or do you mean like there's
channels times batches learnable

1156
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
channels times batches learnable
 

1157
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,389

1158
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399

1159
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,789

>> Am I confused? So great question. We

1161
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,789

never have any learnable parameters

1162
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:02,799
never have any learnable parameters
 

1163
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,669
never have any learnable parameters
associated to batches. This is never

1164
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:05,679
associated to batches. This is never
 

1165
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,110
associated to batches. This is never
done. Okay. So you you never treat

1166
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
done. Okay. So you you never treat
 

1167
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,789
done. Okay. So you you never treat
different batch entries differently

1168
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:10,799
different batch entries differently
 

1169
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,909
different batch entries differently
because they have different learnable

1170
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:11,919
because they have different learnable
 

1171
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,750
because they have different learnable
parameters associated with them.

1172
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:13,760
parameters associated with them.
 

1173
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,430
parameters associated with them.
Remember batches are drawn by shuffling.

1174
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
Remember batches are drawn by shuffling.
 

1175
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,630
Remember batches are drawn by shuffling.
So there's nothing special about

1176
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:16,640
So there's nothing special about
 

1177
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,190
So there's nothing special about
different batch positions ever.

1178
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
different batch positions ever.
 

1179
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,350
different batch positions ever.
Now when I say we have different we can

1180
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
Now when I say we have different we can
 

1181
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,870
Now when I say we have different we can
have different learnable parameters I

1182
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:22,880
have different learnable parameters I
 

1183
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,110
have different learnable parameters I
mean we can have different learnable

1184
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,120
mean we can have different learnable
 

1185
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,710
mean we can have different learnable

that's still okay

that's still okay
 

1191
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,950
that's still okay
does that make sense

1192
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:40,960
does that make sense
 

1193
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,870

every position as being a vector,

1202
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840
every position as being a vector,
 

1203
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,909
every position as being a vector,
right? There's a vector. So in this J

1204
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
right? There's a vector. So in this J
 

1205
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,549
right? There's a vector. So in this J
position, there's a vector. So this is a

1206
00:28:58,549 --> 00:28:58,559
position, there's a vector. So this is a
 

1207
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,190
position, there's a vector. So this is a
vector. This is a vector. And when I do

1208
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,200
vector. This is a vector. And when I do
 

1209
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,870
vector. This is a vector. And when I do
division by a vector, that means

1210
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:02,880
division by a vector, that means
 

1211
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,950
division by a vector, that means
whenever you have an operation that is

1212
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:04,960
whenever you have an operation that is
 

1213
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,470
whenever you have an operation that is
unless specified otherwise always

1214
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,480
unless specified otherwise always
 

1215
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,470
unless specified otherwise always
component-wise. So then if you divide by

1216
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:08,480
component-wise. So then if you divide by
 

1217
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,510
component-wise. So then if you divide by
s, it's also dividing by a vector.

1218
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:11,520
s, it's also dividing by a vector.
 

1219
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,909
s, it's also dividing by a vector.
Uh but you can think or in this case,

00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:13,919
Uh but you can think or in this case,
 

1221
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,350
Uh but you can think or in this case,
sorry, make that very clear.

1222
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:17,360
sorry, make that very clear.
 

1223
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,110
sorry, make that very clear.
uh the m and the s in layer norm are

1224
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
uh the m and the s in layer norm are
 

1225
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,430
uh the m and the s in layer norm are
scalers my mistake so when I do the

1226
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
scalers my mistake so when I do the
 

1227
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,310
scalers my mistake so when I do the
subtraction by m I'm doing it uh when I

1228
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
subtraction by m I'm doing it uh when I
 

1229
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,830
subtraction by m I'm doing it uh when I
have a vector any operation and a scaler

1230
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
have a vector any operation and a scaler
 

1231
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,750

the default is to do it component wise

1232
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:31,760
the default is to do it component wise
 

1233
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,230
the default is to do it component wise
so this in layer you can think of as a

1234
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,240
so this in layer you can think of as a
 

1235
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,149
so this in layer you can think of as a
single m and a single s is a a vector

1236
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:38,159
single m and a single s is a a vector
 

1237
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,630
single m and a single s is a a vector
minus a scaler so that means component

1238
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:40,640
minus a scaler so that means component
 

1239
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,950
minus a scaler so that means component
wise subtract the scaler and I divide by

1240
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:42,960
wise subtract the scaler and I divide by
 

1241
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,149
wise subtract the scaler and I divide by
s that's component-wise divide so Far so

1242
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:46,159
s that's component-wise divide so Far so
 

1243
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,310
s that's component-wise divide so Far so
good hopefully for layerm. Now the gamas

and the deltas we can think of as being

1262
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:12,640

learnable parameters that are different

learnable parameters that are different
 

1265
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,230
learnable parameters that are different
per channel. Does that make sense to

1266
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,240
per channel. Does that make sense to
 

1267
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,070
per channel. Does that make sense to
everybody? This is how you this is how

1268
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,080
everybody? This is how you this is how
 

1269
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,510
everybody? This is how you this is how
you can implement layer norm with

1270
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:19,520
you can implement layer norm with
 

1271
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,669
you can implement layer norm with
different learnable parameters for every

1272
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:21,679
different learnable parameters for every
 

1273
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,310
different learnable parameters for every
position. So the single formula hides

1274
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320
position. So the single formula hides
 

1275
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,070
position. So the single formula hides
different cases based on figuring out

1276
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,080
different cases based on figuring out
 

1277
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,510
different cases based on figuring out
how to get the types to match.

1287
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,909

What to do

1288
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
What to do
 

1289
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:04,710
What to do
at testing time?

1290
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720

 

1291
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,549

So for layer norm

1292
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559

 

1293
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,510

we can just do exactly what we did
 

1297
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,870
we can just do exactly what we did
during training

1298
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:16,880
during training
 

1299
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,230
during training
because layer doesn't look at batches.

1300
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,240
because layer doesn't look at batches.
 

1301
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,070
because layer doesn't look at batches.
It doesn't it doesn't do any combination

1302
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,080
It doesn't it doesn't do any combination
 

1303
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,830
It doesn't it doesn't do any combination
of information across the across the

1304
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:23,840
of information across the across the
 

1305
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,990
of information across the across the
batch. It just looks at everything one

1306
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,000
batch. It just looks at everything one
 

1307
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,950
batch. It just looks at everything one
at a time. So at inference time or

1308
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:28,960
at a time. So at inference time or
 

1309
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,870
at a time. So at inference time or
testing time we have only one thing at

1310
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:30,880
testing time we have only one thing at
 

1311
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,269
testing time we have only one thing at
to work with. So there's no issue of

1312
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:33,279
to work with. So there's no issue of
 

1313
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:44,789
to work with. So there's no issue of
layer but there is an issue for batch.

1314
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:44,799

 

1315
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:56,549

You don't have a batch.

1316
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:56,559

 

1317
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,190

So what do we do for the case when we

1318
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,200
So what do we do for the case when we
 

1319
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,990
So what do we do for the case when we
don't have a batch?

1320
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,000
don't have a batch?
 

1321
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,710
don't have a batch?
So what we need

1322
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720

 

1323
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,269

is M and S.

1324
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:13,279
is M and S.
 

1325
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,590
is M and S.
We can't do this averaging to get the

1326
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
We can't do this averaging to get the
 

1327
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,710
We can't do this averaging to get the
M&S. So we still need it to apply the

1328
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
M&S. So we still need it to apply the
 

1329
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,269
M&S. So we still need it to apply the
formula. So if we had MNS, we could

1330
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:21,279
formula. So if we had MNS, we could
 

1331
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,909
formula. So if we had MNS, we could
apply this formula for the output of

1332
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:23,919
apply this formula for the output of
 

1333
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,310
apply this formula for the output of
batch norm.

1334
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,320
batch norm.
 

1335
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,909
batch norm.
Okay, so we need to get an M&S.

1336
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:29,919
Okay, so we need to get an M&S.
 

1337
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:39,190
Okay, so we need to get an M&S.
So the question is how do we get an M&S?

1338
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,200

 

1339
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,669

So at this point I'll let you guys think

1340
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:41,679
So at this point I'll let you guys think
 

1341
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,269
So at this point I'll let you guys think
for a little bit.

1342
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,279
for a little bit.
 

1343
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,630
for a little bit.
Hopefully everyone understands the

1344
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:44,640
Hopefully everyone understands the
 

1345
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,669
Hopefully everyone understands the
question. So now take a minute, talk to

1346
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:47,679
question. So now take a minute, talk to
 

1347
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,630
question. So now take a minute, talk to
your neighbors and say given that you

1348
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:50,640
your neighbors and say given that you
 

1349
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,870
your neighbors and say given that you
have the uh the setup that you have, how

1350
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:54,880
have the uh the setup that you have, how
 

1351
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,710
have the uh the setup that you have, how
do you get these n and these s's to run

1352
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:56,720
do you get these n and these s's to run
 

1353
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,430
do you get these n and these s's to run
bashnorm at testing time? What what do

1354
00:32:59,430 --> 00:32:59,440
bashnorm at testing time? What what do
 

1355
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,310
bashnorm at testing time? What what do
we have to do to get them? Now when I

1356
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,320
we have to do to get them? Now when I
 

1357
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,230
we have to do to get them? Now when I
say to get them, you have many choices.

1358
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
say to get them, you have many choices.
 

1359
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,590
say to get them, you have many choices.
You could probably do something purely

1360
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:05,600
You could probably do something purely
 

1361
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,350
You could probably do something purely
at testing time. You could also do

1362
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,360
at testing time. You could also do
 

1363
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,870
at testing time. You could also do
something different uh during training

1364
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:08,880
something different uh during training
 

1365
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,630
something different uh during training
to get yourself M&S's. Lots of

1366
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:10,640
to get yourself M&S's. Lots of
 

1367
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,070
to get yourself M&S's. Lots of
possibilities, but just talk to your

1368
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,080
possibilities, but just talk to your
 

1369
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,750
possibilities, but just talk to your
neighbors for a minute and talk about

1370
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:13,760
neighbors for a minute and talk about
 

1371
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:40,149
neighbors for a minute and talk about
and figure out what you might do.

1372
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:40,159

 

1373
00:33:40,159 --> 00:34:05,350

What is the distribution of their

1374
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,360

 

1375
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,909

That's what you

1376
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:09,919

 

1377
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:24,869

>> Oh, you're testing. Oh, I see.

1378
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:24,879

 

1379
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,470

Okay, I'll try to call everyone back

1380
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:26,480
Okay, I'll try to call everyone back
 

1381
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,550
Okay, I'll try to call everyone back
together.

1382
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:28,560
together.
 

1383
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,149
together.
>> Okay.

1384
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:30,159
>> Okay.
 

1385
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,149
>> Okay.
>> So, hopefully you've had a chance to

1386
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
>> So, hopefully you've had a chance to
 

1387
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,829
>> So, hopefully you've had a chance to
think about it. Does anyone in the room

1388
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:35,839
think about it. Does anyone in the room
 

1389
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,149
think about it. Does anyone in the room
want to volunteer a a suggestion of what

1390
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:40,159
want to volunteer a a suggestion of what
 

1391
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:46,389
want to volunteer a a suggestion of what
we could do?

1392
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:46,399

 

1393
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,069

Um, we were thinking we could keep like

1394
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:48,079
Um, we were thinking we could keep like
 

1395
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,550
Um, we were thinking we could keep like
a running average of the mean and

1396
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:50,560
a running average of the mean and
 

1397
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,149
a running average of the mean and
standard deviation on like the last

1398
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:52,159
standard deviation on like the last
 

1399
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,669
standard deviation on like the last
epoch of the training and use that

1400
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:53,679
epoch of the training and use that
 

1401
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,069
epoch of the training and use that
during inference.

1402
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:56,079
during inference.
 

1403
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,829
during inference.
>> Okay, great. That's a great question, a

1404
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:57,839
>> Okay, great. That's a great question, a
 

1405
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,750
>> Okay, great. That's a great question, a
great approach. So, let me write that

1406
00:34:59,750 --> 00:34:59,760
great approach. So, let me write that
 

1407
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,670
great approach. So, let me write that
out. One choice.

1408
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:05,680

 

1409
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,829

Just

1410
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:07,839
Just
 

1411
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,510
Just
get

1412
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,520
get
 

1413
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,910
get
an average

1414
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:13,920

 

1415
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,870

for M

1416
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:16,880
for M
 

1417
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,430
for M
and S

1418
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,440
and S
 

1419
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,950
and S
from the last epoch of training.

1420
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:26,960

 

1421
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,349

Uh that's a totally valid uh thing to

1422
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:29,359
Uh that's a totally valid uh thing to
 

1423
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,550
Uh that's a totally valid uh thing to
do. Um you can also just run one epic

1424
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:32,560
do. Um you can also just run one epic
 

1425
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,750
do. Um you can also just run one epic
with no updates for this purpose.

1426
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:35,760
with no updates for this purpose.
 

1427
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:47,990
with no updates for this purpose.
Okay. Alternative

1428
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,000

 

1429
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,190

training

1430
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,200

 

1431
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,910

with

1432
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:57,920
with
 

1433
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,390
with
no gradient updates.

1434
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:04,400

 

1435
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,030

Okay. So why do I say that? Because this

1436
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,040
Okay. So why do I say that? Because this
 

1437
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,470
Okay. So why do I say that? Because this
is ensuring that the M ands that you

1438
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,480
is ensuring that the M ands that you
 

1439
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,950
is ensuring that the M ands that you
compute as this average is good for

1440
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:12,960
compute as this average is good for
 

1441
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,470
compute as this average is good for
whatever the current parameters are of

1442
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:14,480
whatever the current parameters are of
 

1443
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,589
whatever the current parameters are of
the network. The parameters aren't

1444
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:15,599
the network. The parameters aren't
 

1445
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,310
the network. The parameters aren't
changing at all. Is everyone clear with

1446
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,320
changing at all. Is everyone clear with
 

1447
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,710
changing at all. Is everyone clear with
clear with this about this approach? Any

1448
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:20,720
clear with this about this approach? Any
 

1449
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,910
clear with this about this approach? Any
questions on this approach? It's a way

1450
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:21,920
questions on this approach? It's a way
 

1451
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,870
questions on this approach? It's a way
of getting the M&S that you don't have.

1452
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:24,880
of getting the M&S that you don't have.
 

1453
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,349
of getting the M&S that you don't have.
Okay. Does anyone have any other ideas

1454
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:27,359
Okay. Does anyone have any other ideas
 

1455
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,550
Okay. Does anyone have any other ideas
for what one can do? This is the

1456
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:28,560
for what one can do? This is the
 

1457
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,230
for what one can do? This is the
standard thing to do by the way, but do

1458
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,240
standard thing to do by the way, but do
 

1459
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,990
standard thing to do by the way, but do
you have any other ideas what you could

1460
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,000
you have any other ideas what you could
 

1461
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,550
you have any other ideas what you could
do? um very similar, but you could run

1462
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:34,560
do? um very similar, but you could run
 

1463
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,630
do? um very similar, but you could run
uh like a running exponential average

1464
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:36,640
uh like a running exponential average
 

1465
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,990
uh like a running exponential average
over the last several epochs um and use

1466
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
over the last several epochs um and use
 

1467
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,670
over the last several epochs um and use
those values for M&S.

1468
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:43,680
those values for M&S.
 

1469
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,670
those values for M&S.
>> Okay, so that's an interesting question

1470
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:45,680
>> Okay, so that's an interesting question
 

1471
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,829
>> Okay, so that's an interesting question
that says that instead of using the M&S

1472
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:47,839
that says that instead of using the M&S
 

1473
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,470
that says that instead of using the M&S
that correspond to the actual learn

1474
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:50,480
that correspond to the actual learn
 

1475
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,870
that correspond to the actual learn
parameters that you're using, you could

1476
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:52,880
parameters that you're using, you could
 

1477
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,349
parameters that you're using, you could
take some exponential mixture that way

1478
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,359
take some exponential mixture that way
 

1479
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,630
take some exponential mixture that way
uses some of the older values from uh

1480
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:58,640
uses some of the older values from uh
 

1481
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,030
uses some of the older values from uh
the last Q up of training. Is that I

1482
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,040
the last Q up of training. Is that I
 

1483
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,310
the last Q up of training. Is that I
understand your suggestion correctly.

1484
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:02,320
understand your suggestion correctly.
 

1485
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,150
understand your suggestion correctly.
>> Yes, exactly.

1486
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,160
>> Yes, exactly.
 

1487
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,710
>> Yes, exactly.
>> Okay. So

1488
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:06,720
>> Okay. So
 

1489
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,230
>> Okay. So
that's something one could do but one

1490
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,240
that's something one could do but one
 

1491
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,470
that's something one could do but one
doesn't do. However, a very related idea

1492
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:10,480
doesn't do. However, a very related idea
 

1493
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,230
doesn't do. However, a very related idea
is something that people do do in

1494
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,240
is something that people do do in
 

1495
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,910
is something that people do do in
practice which is they they do the same

1496
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
practice which is they they do the same
 

1497
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,910
practice which is they they do the same
exponential averaging idea but they

1498
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:17,920
exponential averaging idea but they
 

1499
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,589
exponential averaging idea but they
don't do it at uh during training. They

1500
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:21,599
don't do it at uh during training. They
 

1501
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,870
don't do it at uh during training. They
do it during actual testing or execution

1502
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
do it during actual testing or execution
 

1503
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,470
do it during actual testing or execution
in the field. Okay.

1504
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,480
in the field. Okay.
 

1505
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,270
in the field. Okay.
So can keep

1506
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:33,280
So can keep
 

1507
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,710
So can keep
uh

1508
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:36,720

 

1509
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,589

running average

1510
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:41,599

 

1511
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:50,470

exponential moving

1512
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480

 

1513
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,790

during inference.

1514
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:54,800

 

1515
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,150

So the idea here is that you're not

1516
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,160
So the idea here is that you're not
 

1517
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,430
So the idea here is that you're not
going to be for your vision problem.

1518
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
going to be for your vision problem.
 

1519
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,950
going to be for your vision problem.
Let's say you're not going to be looking

1520
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:58,960
Let's say you're not going to be looking
 

1521
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,069
Let's say you're not going to be looking
at one image. You're going to be looking

1522
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:00,079
at one image. You're going to be looking
 

1523
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,069
at one image. You're going to be looking
at many and many many of them. For

1524
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:02,079
at many and many many of them. For
 

1525
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,670
at many and many many of them. For
example, think of a driving application.

1526
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:03,680
example, think of a driving application.
 

1527
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,230
example, think of a driving application.
You're driving your car. And instead of

1528
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,240
You're driving your car. And instead of
 

1529
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,670
You're driving your car. And instead of
keeping uh a single frozen M&S, you let

1530
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:09,680
keeping uh a single frozen M&S, you let
 

1531
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,230
keeping uh a single frozen M&S, you let
the M&S vary slowly based on the current

1532
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,240
the M&S vary slowly based on the current
 

1533
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,589
the M&S vary slowly based on the current
data distribution that you're actually

1534
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:13,599
data distribution that you're actually
 

1535
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,190
data distribution that you're actually
seeing into your into your image

1536
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,200
seeing into your into your image
 

1537
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,230
seeing into your into your image
classifier or whatever.

1538
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:18,240
classifier or whatever.
 

1539
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,910
classifier or whatever.
Okay, does everyone understand this

1540
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:19,920
Okay, does everyone understand this
 

1541
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,349
Okay, does everyone understand this
idea?

1542
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:21,359
idea?
 

1543
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,190
idea?
So it can it can allow for a little bit

1544
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,200
So it can it can allow for a little bit
 

1545
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,430
So it can it can allow for a little bit
of test time adaptation

1546
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:25,440
of test time adaptation
 

1547
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,750
of test time adaptation
uh by by doing by doing computing in

1548
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:27,760
uh by by doing by doing computing in
 

1549
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,950
uh by by doing by doing computing in
this way that's sometimes done by people

1550
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
this way that's sometimes done by people
 

1551
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,870
this way that's sometimes done by people
in deployment if it makes sense if

1552
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:32,880
in deployment if it makes sense if
 

1553
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,870
in deployment if it makes sense if
you're application says you want to

1554
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:34,880
you're application says you want to
 

1555
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,990
you're application says you want to
adapt maybe do a little bit of

1556
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,000
adapt maybe do a little bit of
 

1557
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,990
adapt maybe do a little bit of
adaptation this way and the third

1558
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,000
adaptation this way and the third
 

1559
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,670
adaptation this way and the third
approach which is kind of similar uh in

1560
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:41,680
approach which is kind of similar uh in
 

1561
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,790
approach which is kind of similar uh in
spirit is

1562
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:44,800
spirit is
 

1563
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,829
spirit is
just learn

1564
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:47,839
just learn
 

1565
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,430
just learn
M and test

1566
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,440
M and test
 

1567
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:58,069
M and test
using held out data.

1568
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:58,079

 

1569
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,390

So treat them like hyperparameters

1570
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:00,400
So treat them like hyperparameters
 

1571
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,430
So treat them like hyperparameters
that you have to set for operation and

1572
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:03,440
that you have to set for operation and
 

1573
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,950
that you have to set for operation and
use some held out little bit of held out

1574
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:04,960
use some held out little bit of held out
 

1575
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,310
use some held out little bit of held out
data to just train them

1576
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,320
data to just train them
 

1577
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,990
data to just train them
using regular grading descent.

1578
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,000

 

1579
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,790

Okay, all are valid uh choices of what

1580
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:16,800
Okay, all are valid uh choices of what
 

1581
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,710
Okay, all are valid uh choices of what
to do. They depend application wise

1582
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:18,720
to do. They depend application wise
 

1583
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,230
to do. They depend application wise
which you actually do with batch norm.

1584
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,240
which you actually do with batch norm.
 

1585
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,230
which you actually do with batch norm.
Okay.

1586
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,240
Okay.
 

1587
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,829
Okay.
Any other questions here about uh uh

1588
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:27,839
Any other questions here about uh uh
 

1589
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,790
Any other questions here about uh uh
getting batch norm to work? Again this

1590
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:30,800
getting batch norm to work? Again this
 

1591
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,310
getting batch norm to work? Again this
issue only affects batch norm because

1592
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:32,320
issue only affects batch norm because
 

1593
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,310
issue only affects batch norm because
you have batches. It doesn't affect

1594
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
you have batches. It doesn't affect
 

1595
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,950
you have batches. It doesn't affect
layer norm or you know RMS norm which is

1596
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:36,960
layer norm or you know RMS norm which is
 

1597
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,270
layer norm or you know RMS norm which is
usually people say RMS norm layers they

1598
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:39,280
usually people say RMS norm layers they
 

1599
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,589
usually people say RMS norm layers they
usually mean RMS norm style layer norm.

1600
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:45,599

 

1601
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,550

Any questions?

1602
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:50,560

 

1603
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,510

Okay, great. So, we can keep moving.

1604
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:55,520
Okay, great. So, we can keep moving.
 

1605
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,510
Okay, great. So, we can keep moving.
So, now uh I want to to kind of think

1606
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,520
So, now uh I want to to kind of think
 

1607
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,510
So, now uh I want to to kind of think
about it a little bit and say

1608
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:03,520
about it a little bit and say
 

1609
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,750
about it a little bit and say
we saw the inspiration for doing

1610
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:05,760
we saw the inspiration for doing
 

1611
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,470
we saw the inspiration for doing
bashnorm as coming from the idea that

1612
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:08,480
bashnorm as coming from the idea that
 

1613
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,109
bashnorm as coming from the idea that
look I did input standardization and it

1614
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:11,119
look I did input standardization and it
 

1615
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,109
look I did input standardization and it
tends to be helpful. Is there a

1616
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:13,119
tends to be helpful. Is there a
 

1617
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,430
tends to be helpful. Is there a
counterpart to input standardization

1618
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,440
counterpart to input standardization
 

1619
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,390
counterpart to input standardization
that I can do uh in between layers?

1620
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,400
that I can do uh in between layers?
 

1621
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,430
that I can do uh in between layers?
So once you have this analogy set up

1622
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:23,440
So once you have this analogy set up
 

1623
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,349
So once you have this analogy set up
that does what you do what normal things

1624
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:25,359
that does what you do what normal things
 

1625
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,270
that does what you do what normal things
you do to inputs

1626
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:27,280
you do to inputs
 

1627
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,390
you do to inputs
how can I do them between layers you ask

1628
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:30,400
how can I do them between layers you ask
 

1629
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,710
how can I do them between layers you ask
and ask the same question for data

1630
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:32,720
and ask the same question for data
 

1631
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,230
and ask the same question for data
augmentation.

1632
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,240

 

1633
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,150

Does everyone understand what the sort

1634
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,160
Does everyone understand what the sort
 

1635
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,630
Does everyone understand what the sort
of spirit of the question is? Spirit of

1636
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:40,640
of spirit of the question is? Spirit of
 

1637
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,069
of spirit of the question is? Spirit of
the question says, how can I get

1638
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:44,079
the question says, how can I get
 

1639
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,109
the question says, how can I get
something that's like data augmentation

1640
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:47,119
something that's like data augmentation
 

1641
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,670
something that's like data augmentation
except I do it

1642
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:49,680
except I do it
 

1643
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,310
except I do it
inside of our network for different

1644
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:52,320
inside of our network for different
 

1645
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,349
inside of our network for different
layers.

1646
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:57,359

 

1647
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,430

Okay,

1648
00:40:59,430 --> 00:40:59,440
Okay,
 

1649
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,950
Okay,
so this brings us to

1650
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960
so this brings us to
 

1651
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:14,470
so this brings us to
uh a topic called dropout.

1652
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:14,480

 

1653
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,109

So, dropout is uh you can think of it as

1654
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:19,119
So, dropout is uh you can think of it as
 

1655
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:36,550
So, dropout is uh you can think of it as
a data augmentation.

1656
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:36,560

 

1657
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,829

I

1658
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:37,839
I
 

1659
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:46,069
I
inside our network

1660
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:46,079

 

1661
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:56,069

during training.

1662
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,079

 

1663
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,349

So what is the what is the purpose of

1664
00:41:59,349 --> 00:41:59,359
So what is the what is the purpose of
 

1665
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,950
So what is the what is the purpose of
doing data augmentations? Purpose of

1666
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:00,960
doing data augmentations? Purpose of
 

1667
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,670
doing data augmentations? Purpose of
day-to-day augmentations is to make your

1668
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:03,680
day-to-day augmentations is to make your
 

1669
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,750
day-to-day augmentations is to make your
network that you've learned more robust

1670
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:05,760
network that you've learned more robust
 

1671
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,790
network that you've learned more robust
and to generalize better. And dropout is

1672
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:08,800
and to generalize better. And dropout is
 

1673
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,870
and to generalize better. And dropout is
the same way. It's used to make your

1674
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:10,880
the same way. It's used to make your
 

1675
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,630
the same way. It's used to make your
network more robust and to generalize

1676
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:12,640
network more robust and to generalize
 

1677
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,150
network more robust and to generalize
better.

1678
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,160
better.
 

1679
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,950
better.
However, once you're inside the network,

1680
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:16,960
However, once you're inside the network,
 

1681
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,190
However, once you're inside the network,
the kind of augmentations that we talked

1682
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
the kind of augmentations that we talked
 

1683
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,630
the kind of augmentations that we talked
about for images that were coming from

1684
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:20,640
about for images that were coming from
 

1685
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,750
about for images that were coming from
the natural physics of of an image like

1686
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:23,760
the natural physics of of an image like
 

1687
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,270
the natural physics of of an image like
you know adding rotations and this

1688
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
you know adding rotations and this
 

1689
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,950
you know adding rotations and this
stuff, those don't tend to make as much

1690
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:26,960
stuff, those don't tend to make as much
 

1691
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,550
stuff, those don't tend to make as much
sense.

1692
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:28,560
sense.
 

1693
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,630
sense.
However, there is one thing that you can

1694
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:30,640
However, there is one thing that you can
 

1695
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,150
However, there is one thing that you can
do

1696
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,160
do
 

1697
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,430
do
and this one thing that you can do is

1698
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:35,440
and this one thing that you can do is
 

1699
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,230
and this one thing that you can do is
idea

1700
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,240

 

1701
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,390

just remove

1702
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,400

 

1703
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,150

slash zero out

1704
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,160

 

1705
00:42:50,160 --> 00:43:01,030

random activations.

1706
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,040

 

1707
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,630

So this is why it's called dropout

1708
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:02,640
So this is why it's called dropout
 

1709
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,790
So this is why it's called dropout
because you drop things out.

1710
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:06,800

 

1711
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,670

Okay. So the first question before we

1712
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:09,680
Okay. So the first question before we
 

1713
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,430
Okay. So the first question before we
talk about the the mechanics of it in a

1714
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:11,440
talk about the the mechanics of it in a
 

1715
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,230
talk about the the mechanics of it in a
slightly more detail. Uh first question

1716
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:14,240
slightly more detail. Uh first question
 

1717
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,510
slightly more detail. Uh first question
you have is you know

1718
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,520
you have is you know
 

1719
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,790
you have is you know
why would you why does this even

1720
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:18,800
why would you why does this even
 

1721
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,190
why would you why does this even
potentially make any sense because the

1722
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:23,200
potentially make any sense because the
 

1723
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,550
potentially make any sense because the
you know the different activations are

1724
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:24,560
you know the different activations are
 

1725
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,950
you know the different activations are
presumably carrying uh some very useful

1726
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:26,960
presumably carrying uh some very useful
 

1727
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,990
presumably carrying uh some very useful
information. Why would you want to get

1728
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,000
information. Why would you want to get
 

1729
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,470
information. Why would you want to get
rid of it? So the reason you want to get

1730
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:30,480
rid of it? So the reason you want to get
 

1731
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,309
rid of it? So the reason you want to get
rid of it is that

1732
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:34,319
rid of it is that
 

1733
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:40,230
rid of it is that
this encourages

1734
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:40,240

 

1735
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:49,109

internal representations

1736
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:49,119

 

1737
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:56,870

to be redundant.

1738
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:56,880

 

1739
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,430

So this might seem counterintuitive or

1740
00:43:59,430 --> 00:43:59,440
So this might seem counterintuitive or
 

1741
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,870
So this might seem counterintuitive or
paradoxical like why would you want to

1742
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:00,880
paradoxical like why would you want to
 

1743
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,069
paradoxical like why would you want to
encourage your internal representation

1744
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,079
encourage your internal representation
 

1745
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,990
encourage your internal representation
to be redundant? Isn't non-redundancy

1746
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,000
to be redundant? Isn't non-redundancy
 

1747
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,990
to be redundant? Isn't non-redundancy
good? It turns out for neural nets

1748
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,000
good? It turns out for neural nets
 

1749
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,910
good? It turns out for neural nets
neural nets like and function better

1750
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:07,920
neural nets like and function better
 

1751
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,390
neural nets like and function better
with redundancy. Redundancy means that

1752
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,400
with redundancy. Redundancy means that
 

1753
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,550
with redundancy. Redundancy means that
there's you can try to group things

1754
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:12,560
there's you can try to group things
 

1755
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,309
there's you can try to group things
together into a lower dimensional space

1756
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:14,319
together into a lower dimensional space
 

1757
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,150
together into a lower dimensional space
like having singular directions that are

1758
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,160
like having singular directions that are
 

1759
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,950
like having singular directions that are
more useful across activations.

1760
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
more useful across activations.
 

1761
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,270
more useful across activations.
So this is uh one reason again the

1762
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:23,280
So this is uh one reason again the
 

1763
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,109
So this is uh one reason again the
practical setting is it's just it makes

1764
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:25,119
practical setting is it's just it makes
 

1765
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,950
practical setting is it's just it makes
networks work better sometimes.

1766
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:28,960
networks work better sometimes.
 

1767
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,829
networks work better sometimes.
So uh okay now we can talk a little bit

1768
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:31,839
So uh okay now we can talk a little bit
 

1769
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,349
So uh okay now we can talk a little bit
about the mechanics of how do you how do

1770
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:33,359
about the mechanics of how do you how do
 

1771
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:35,750
about the mechanics of how do you how do
you actually make this happen uh but

1772
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:35,760
you actually make this happen uh but
 

1773
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,270
you actually make this happen uh but
maybe I'll I'll pause here for a moment

1774
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:37,280
maybe I'll I'll pause here for a moment
 

1775
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,550
maybe I'll I'll pause here for a moment
for for questions before going into the

1776
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:38,560
for for questions before going into the
 

1777
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,150
for for questions before going into the
mechanics. Anyone have any questions on

1778
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:40,160
mechanics. Anyone have any questions on
 

1779
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,910
mechanics. Anyone have any questions on
like idea of dropout? Like what we're

1780
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
like idea of dropout? Like what we're
 

1781
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,470
like idea of dropout? Like what we're
trying to do and before I tell you

1782
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:44,480
trying to do and before I tell you
 

1783
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,150
trying to do and before I tell you
exactly the details of how we do it.

1784
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:50,160

 

1785
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,390

>> I don't see any questions.

1786
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:52,400
>> I don't see any questions.
 

1787
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,510
>> I don't see any questions.
>> Okay, great. Thank you. So I'll I'll uh

1788
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:55,520
>> Okay, great. Thank you. So I'll I'll uh
 

1789
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,589
>> Okay, great. Thank you. So I'll I'll uh
uh continue.

1790
00:44:57,589 --> 00:44:57,599
uh continue.
 

1791
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,910
uh continue.
So first a comment. This is typically

1792
00:44:59,910 --> 00:44:59,920
So first a comment. This is typically
 

1793
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,230
So first a comment. This is typically
used

1794
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:06,240

 

1795
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,550

for

1796
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:08,560
for
 

1797
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,750
for
MLP style layers.

1798
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:13,760

 

1799
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,630

So this includes you know as a result it

1800
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,640
So this includes you know as a result it
 

1801
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:25,030
So this includes you know as a result it
includes one by one convolutions.

1802
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,040

 

1803
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,309

When you think dropout, you should think

1804
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:26,319
When you think dropout, you should think
 

1805
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,950
When you think dropout, you should think
of it as acting on channels is one way

1806
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:28,960
of it as acting on channels is one way
 

1807
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,150
of it as acting on channels is one way
to think about it intuitively.

1808
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160

 

1809
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,910

So

1810
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:35,920
So
 

1811
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,230
So
for an MLP, think of it this way. We

1812
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:38,240
for an MLP, think of it this way. We
 

1813
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,950
for an MLP, think of it this way. We
have

1814
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:42,960

 

1815
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:49,030

some HL

1816
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040

 

1817
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,190

CN channels.

1818
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200

 

1819
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,790

Okay.

1820
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,800

 

1821
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,470

What dropout does

1822
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,480

 

1823
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:14,390

component-wise multiplies

1824
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400

 

1825
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,630

HL

1826
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:16,640
HL
 

1827
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,790
HL
with IID

1828
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:20,800

1829
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,630
with IID
Bernoli?

1830
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:26,640

 

1831
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,829

noise.

1832
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:29,839

 

1833
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,710

Okay. So what does that mean?

1834
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:34,720

 

1835
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,550

HL of J

1836
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:38,560

 

1837
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,510

becomes when the output say the output

1838
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520
becomes when the output say the output
 

1839
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:47,349
becomes when the output say the output
of dropout becomes zero

1840
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:47,359

 

1841
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,150

if

1842
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,160
if
 

1843
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,950
if
coin is

1844
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:52,960
coin is
 

1845
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,470
coin is
tails

1846
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,480
tails
 

1847
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:04,710
tails
one not one Sorry,

1848
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:04,720

 

1849
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,430

coin is heads

1850
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:09,440

 

1851
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,950

and so there's some probability that

1852
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:10,960
and so there's some probability that
 

1853
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,790
and so there's some probability that
this happens

1854
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:14,800

 

1855
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,510

say probability P of being heads. So

1856
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:17,520
say probability P of being heads. So
 

1857
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,589
say probability P of being heads. So
this is this P in this if I put the

1858
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:19,599
this is this P in this if I put the
 

1859
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,390
this is this P in this if I put the
probability here this probability P is

1860
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,400
probability here this probability P is
 

1861
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,550
probability here this probability P is
the probability

1862
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:26,560

 

1863
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,349

of keeping

1864
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:29,359
of keeping
 

1865
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:34,630
of keeping
and 1 minus P is the probability

1866
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:34,640
and 1 minus P is the probability
 

1867
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:41,990
and 1 minus P is the probability
of dropping out.

1868
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:42,000

 

1869
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,990

Okay,

1870
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,000
Okay,
 

1871
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,589
Okay,
so basic story of how to use dropout.

1872
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:47,599
so basic story of how to use dropout.
 

1873
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,950
so basic story of how to use dropout.
Sometimes it's called introducing a

1874
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:48,960
Sometimes it's called introducing a
 

1875
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,870
Sometimes it's called introducing a
dropout layer. So why is it called a

1876
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880
dropout layer. So why is it called a
 

1877
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,309
dropout layer. So why is it called a
dropout layer? because you can think of

1878
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:52,319
dropout layer? because you can think of
 

1879
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,309
dropout layer? because you can think of
this operation as being a layer where

1880
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:54,319
this operation as being a layer where
 

1881
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,790
this operation as being a layer where
you do multiplication component-wise by

1882
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:56,800
you do multiplication component-wise by
 

1883
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,630
you do multiplication component-wise by
a vector that has either ones or zeros

1884
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:58,640
a vector that has either ones or zeros
 

1885
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,550
a vector that has either ones or zeros
in it that is generated randomly.

1886
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:02,560
in it that is generated randomly.
 

1887
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,470
in it that is generated randomly.
So during training in this conceptual

1888
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:06,480
So during training in this conceptual
 

1889
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,109
So during training in this conceptual
picture all you do is you realize this

1890
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:09,119
picture all you do is you realize this
 

1891
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,630
picture all you do is you realize this
randomness this randomness is

1892
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:10,640
randomness this randomness is
 

1893
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,790
randomness this randomness is
non-ifferiable so there's never going to

1894
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:12,800
non-ifferiable so there's never going to
 

1895
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,550
non-ifferiable so there's never going to
be a gradient on this randomness to this

1896
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:14,560
be a gradient on this randomness to this
 

1897
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,510
be a gradient on this randomness to this
randomness and you just say network keep

1898
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:17,520
randomness and you just say network keep
 

1899
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,950
randomness and you just say network keep
calculating calculate your gradients

00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:29,040
will talk a little bit in a moment about

make sure everyone understands like what
 

1913
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,950
make sure everyone understands like what
you do here. When I say I want to drop

1914
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
you do here. When I say I want to drop
 

1915
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,309
you do here. When I say I want to drop
out and I want to drop out with

1916
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:36,319
out and I want to drop out with
 

1917
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,190
out and I want to drop out with
probability of dropping being 10%. Then

1918
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:39,200
probability of dropping being 10%. Then
 

1919
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,270
probability of dropping being 10%. Then
what I mean is I toss a coin that comes

1920
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,280
what I mean is I toss a coin that comes
 

1921
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,430
what I mean is I toss a coin that comes
up head 90% of the time and tails 10% of

up head 90% of the time and tails 10% of
the time and I component-wise for that

1924
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:46,400

dropout layer multiply inputs so that
they are kept with probability 90% and

1928
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:51,119
they are kept with probability 90% and
 

1929
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,109
they are kept with probability 90% and

00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:07,359
thing is we don't expect it to be there
 

1943
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,150
thing is we don't expect it to be there
at testing.

1944
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
at testing.
 

1945
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,589
at testing.
This is something like like a data

1946
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:11,599
This is something like like a data
 

1947
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,549
This is something like like a data
augmentation. Remember we talked about

1948
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:12,559
augmentation. Remember we talked about
 

1949
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,910
augmentation. Remember we talked about
the data augmentations. We take your

1950
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:13,920
the data augmentations. We take your
 

1951
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,069
the data augmentations. We take your
data and you rotate it a little bit,

1952
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:16,079
data and you rotate it a little bit,
 

1953
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,870
data and you rotate it a little bit,
change the contrast or do even more uh

1954
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:18,880
change the contrast or do even more uh
 

1955
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,069
change the contrast or do even more uh
harder things on like cutting out

1956
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:20,079
harder things on like cutting out
 

1957
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,069
harder things on like cutting out
pieces, stuff like that. We don't do

1958
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:22,079
pieces, stuff like that. We don't do
 

1959
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,829
pieces, stuff like that. We don't do
that at test time. That's just there at

1960
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:25,839
that at test time. That's just there at
 

1961
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,750
that at test time. That's just there at
training time. Same thing with dropout.

1962
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
training time. Same thing with dropout.
 

1963
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,670
training time. Same thing with dropout.
Dropout doesn't exist at test time. It's

1964
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:29,680
Dropout doesn't exist at test time. It's
 

1965
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,829
Dropout doesn't exist at test time. It's
only there at training time. That's why

1966
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:31,839
only there at training time. That's why
 

1967
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,549
only there at training time. That's why
you don't make plearnable.

1968
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:34,559
you don't make plearnable.
 

1969
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,670
you don't make plearnable.
Thank you.

1970
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:37,680
Thank you.
 

1971
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,510
Thank you.
It's a hyperparameter we set as a part

1972
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:39,520
It's a hyperparameter we set as a part
 

1973
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,589
It's a hyperparameter we set as a part

dropout. Typical values for P that are
 

1977
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,190

10% dropout 10% or drop out half. These
are like standard kind of values that

1982
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:51,680
are like standard kind of values that
 

1983
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,349
are like standard kind of values that
people try for dropout.

1984
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:53,359
people try for dropout.
 

1985
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,589

understanding how this creates
 

1991
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,470
understanding how this creates
redundancy. I feel like we're just

1992
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:00,480
redundancy. I feel like we're just
 

1993
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,950
redundancy. I feel like we're just
losing data because we're just taking

does this encourage redundancy? It

2000
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:08,559
does this encourage redundancy? It
 

2001
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,190
does this encourage redundancy? It
encourages redundancy because if you had

2002
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:11,200
encourages redundancy because if you had
 

2003
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,230
encourages redundancy because if you had
very important data in one particular

2004
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:14,240
very important data in one particular
 

2005
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,510
very important data in one particular
place and then dropout destroyed it,

2006
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:17,520
place and then dropout destroyed it,
 

2007
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,030
place and then dropout destroyed it,
that would not be good for your network.

2008
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:21,040
that would not be good for your network.
 

2009
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,549
that would not be good for your network.
So because you're doing dropout during

2010
00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:22,559
So because you're doing dropout during
 

2011
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,030
So because you're doing dropout during
training for it to raise its performance

00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:25,040
training for it to raise its performance
 

2013
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,630

00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,950
problem where where you'll see how
dropout helps uh in an MLP where we do

2048
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:04,960
dropout helps uh in an MLP where we do
 

2049
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,030
dropout helps uh in an MLP where we do
it.

2050
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
it.
 

2051
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,510
it.
We have a special modified version of a

2052
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:09,520
We have a special modified version of a
 

2053
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,069
We have a special modified version of a
data set which has we introduce cheats.

2054
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:12,079
data set which has we introduce cheats.
 

2055
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,670
data set which has we introduce cheats.
We introduce ways that the classifier

2056
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:13,680
We introduce ways that the classifier
 

2057
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,510
We introduce ways that the classifier
could learn what to do by cheating

2058
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:15,520
could learn what to do by cheating
 

2059
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,950
could learn what to do by cheating
because we just like write the answer on

2060
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:16,960
because we just like write the answer on
 

2061
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,790
because we just like write the answer on
the image. And when you do it, when you

2062
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:18,800
the image. And when you do it, when you
 

2063
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,109
the image. And when you do it, when you
train it with dropout, it is less able

2064
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:21,119
train it with dropout, it is less able
 

2065
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,390
train it with dropout, it is less able
to use the cheat because the it doesn't

2066
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:24,400
to use the cheat because the it doesn't
 

2067
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,150
to use the cheat because the it doesn't
see the cheat uh as well all the time.

2068
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,160
see the cheat uh as well all the time.
 

2069
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,309
see the cheat uh as well all the time.
So that's an example of how redundancy

2070
00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:30,319
So that's an example of how redundancy
 

2071
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,069
So that's an example of how redundancy
is better because you want to have it

2072
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:32,079
is better because you want to have it
 

2073
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,750
is better because you want to have it
take information from across the entire

2074
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:33,760
take information from across the entire
 

2075
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,630
take information from across the entire
image and not from a little piece and

2076
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:36,640
image and not from a little piece and
 

2077
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,790
image and not from a little piece and
dropout encourages that.

2078
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:40,800

 

2079
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,750

Okay. Okay. So now

2080
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:45,760

 

2081
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,390

one finds the same issue that we had in

2082
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:48,400
one finds the same issue that we had in
 

2083
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,430
one finds the same issue that we had in
so what happens uh

2084
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
so what happens uh
 

2085
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,270
so what happens uh
at training

2086
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:57,280

 

2087
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,589

do drop out

2088
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:01,599

 

2089
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,030

randomly

2090
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040

 

2091
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:11,589

and typically

2092
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:11,599

 

2093
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,549

D fraction

2094
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:16,559

 

2095
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,309

of activations

2096
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:20,319

 

2097
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,870

survive

2098
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:22,880
survive
 

2099
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,630
survive
the dropout.

2100
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:24,640
the dropout.
 

2101
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,549
the dropout.
So now the question is what do we do at

2102
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:26,559
So now the question is what do we do at
 

2103
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:49,030
So now the question is what do we do at
test time?

2104
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:49,040

 

2105
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,750

So when you're using the model at at

2106
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:51,760
So when you're using the model at at
 

2107
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,150
So when you're using the model at at
inference time uh you have to do

2108
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:54,160
inference time uh you have to do
 

2109
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,589
inference time uh you have to do
something. So one choice so try zero say

2110
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:57,599
something. So one choice so try zero say
 

2111
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,390
something. So one choice so try zero say
try zero

2112
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:00,400
try zero
 

2113
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,270
try zero
is do nothing

2114
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:05,280

 

2115
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,309

just let all everything come through.

2116
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:08,319
just let all everything come through.
 

2117
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,270
just let all everything come through.
You ever understand how this is a

2118
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:09,280
You ever understand how this is a
 

2119
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,829
You ever understand how this is a
natural choice you say you do this for

2120
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:11,839
natural choice you say you do this for
 

2121
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,270
natural choice you say you do this for
augmentations of images right? for

2122
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,280
augmentations of images right? for
 

2123
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,710
augmentations of images right? for
augmentations of images. If you were

2124
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,720
augmentations of images. If you were
 

2125
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,710
augmentations of images. If you were
going in and you know adding a bunch of

2126
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:16,720
going in and you know adding a bunch of
 

2127
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,950
going in and you know adding a bunch of
noise or you know cutting out pieces of

2128
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:18,960
noise or you know cutting out pieces of
 

2129
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,829
noise or you know cutting out pieces of
the image during uh during training at

2130
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:21,839
the image during uh during training at
 

2131
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,870
the image during uh during training at
test time you're just going to use it

2132
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:24,880
test time you're just going to use it
 

2133
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,470
test time you're just going to use it
with images without having this damage

2134
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:26,480
with images without having this damage
 

2135
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,549
with images without having this damage
done to them.

2136
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:28,559
done to them.
 

2137
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,549
done to them.
So you could one natural choice and try

2138
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:30,559
So you could one natural choice and try
 

2139
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,990
So you could one natural choice and try
the same strategy or drop out just do

2140
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:34,000
the same strategy or drop out just do
 

2141
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,470
the same strategy or drop out just do
nothing at test time.

2142
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,480
nothing at test time.
 

2143
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,990
nothing at test time.
Everyone everyone's with me hopefully on

2144
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:38,000
Everyone everyone's with me hopefully on
 

2145
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,190
Everyone everyone's with me hopefully on
understanding this is the natural thing

2146
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:39,200
understanding this is the natural thing
 

2147
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:51,270
understanding this is the natural thing
to try. Turns out this doesn't work.

2148
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:51,280

 

2149
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,109

Does anyone want to venture a guess as

2150
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:53,119
Does anyone want to venture a guess as
 

2151
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:58,790
Does anyone want to venture a guess as
to why it doesn't work?

2152
00:53:58,790 --> 00:53:58,800

 

2153
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,910

Pick somebody to answer. Yeah.

2154
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
Pick somebody to answer. Yeah.
 

2155
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,270
Pick somebody to answer. Yeah.
>> Yeah. I mean, I think it's probably a

2156
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:03,280
>> Yeah. I mean, I think it's probably a
 

2157
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,109
>> Yeah. I mean, I think it's probably a
bit of a matter of scale, right? Let's

2158
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,119
bit of a matter of scale, right? Let's
 

2159
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,630
bit of a matter of scale, right? Let's
say like you've, you know, a simple

2160
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:06,640
say like you've, you know, a simple
 

2161
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,190
say like you've, you know, a simple
thing. It's like you learn to to add up

2162
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:09,200
thing. It's like you learn to to add up
 

2163
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,670
thing. It's like you learn to to add up
numbers and you have 10 items with uh a

2164
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:13,680
numbers and you have 10 items with uh a
 

2165
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,069
numbers and you have 10 items with uh a
pres preservation probability of 0.9 and

2166
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:16,079
pres preservation probability of 0.9 and
 

2167
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,589
pres preservation probability of 0.9 and
it learns like oh I want to keep adding

2168
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:17,599
it learns like oh I want to keep adding
 

2169
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,950
it learns like oh I want to keep adding
to nine so I'm going to make everything

2170
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:18,960
to nine so I'm going to make everything
 

2171
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,589
to nine so I'm going to make everything
one right but all of a sudden when you

2172
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:21,599
one right but all of a sudden when you
 

2173
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,510
one right but all of a sudden when you
go to testing time and you keep

2174
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
go to testing time and you keep
 

2175
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,670
go to testing time and you keep
everything activated since your network

2176
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:25,680
everything activated since your network
 

2177
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,390
everything activated since your network
has like learned to make each entry one

2178
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:28,400
has like learned to make each entry one
 

2179
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,910
has like learned to make each entry one
all of a sudden when you keep everything

2180
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:29,920
all of a sudden when you keep everything
 

2181
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,069
all of a sudden when you keep everything
you hit 10. So all of a sudden sort of

2182
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:32,079
you hit 10. So all of a sudden sort of
 

2183
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,950
you hit 10. So all of a sudden sort of
the scale you're getting to exceeds

2184
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:34,960
the scale you're getting to exceeds
 

2185
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,630
the scale you're getting to exceeds
because you simply have more of your

2186
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:36,640
because you simply have more of your
 

2187
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,150
because you simply have more of your
values at your disposal.

2188
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:40,160
values at your disposal.
 

2189
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,349
values at your disposal.
>> Yep. Excellent answer. It messes up

2190
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:43,359
>> Yep. Excellent answer. It messes up
 

2191
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:48,950
>> Yep. Excellent answer. It messes up
scale.

2192
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:48,960

 

2193
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,630

So remember one of the most fundamental

2194
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:50,640
So remember one of the most fundamental
 

2195
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,390
So remember one of the most fundamental
things we learned about neural nets that

2196
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:52,400
things we learned about neural nets that
 

2197
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,069
things we learned about neural nets that
drove our discussion of optimization and

2198
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:54,079
drove our discussion of optimization and
 

2199
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,910
drove our discussion of optimization and
thinking about RMS norm and so on is

2200
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:55,920
thinking about RMS norm and so on is
 

2201
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,510
thinking about RMS norm and so on is
that these neural nets like to have

2202
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,520
that these neural nets like to have
 

2203
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,069
that these neural nets like to have
their activations and pre-activations in

2204
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:00,079
their activations and pre-activations in
 

2205
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,829
their activations and pre-activations in
a particular range around zero you know

2206
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:03,839
a particular range around zero you know
 

2207
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:07,030
a particular range around zero you know
in some near vicinity. If suddenly you

2208
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:07,040
in some near vicinity. If suddenly you
 

2209
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,549
in some near vicinity. If suddenly you
are not dropping out a bunch of numbers,

2210
00:55:10,549 --> 00:55:10,559
are not dropping out a bunch of numbers,
 

2211
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,589
are not dropping out a bunch of numbers,
it's going to get bigger

2212
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:13,599
it's going to get bigger
 

2213
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,030
it's going to get bigger
and it's no longer going to be in the

2214
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:15,040
and it's no longer going to be in the
 

2215
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,109
and it's no longer going to be in the
range that it was trained for and so

2216
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:17,119
range that it was trained for and so
 

2217
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,910
range that it was trained for and so
it'll stop working.

2218
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:19,920
it'll stop working.
 

2219
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,230
it'll stop working.
So the solution

2220
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240

 

2221
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:30,549

is to scale

2222
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:30,559

 

2223
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,829

activations

2224
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:33,839

 

2225
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,910

by P.

2226
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:35,920
by P.
 

2227
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,549
by P.
the probability of keeping.

2228
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:38,559
the probability of keeping.
 

2229
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,030
the probability of keeping.
So this you can think of as

2230
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,040

 

2231
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,109

replaces

2232
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:45,119
replaces
 

2233
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:52,150
replaces
multiplicative noise

2234
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:52,160

 

2235
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:58,470

by its mean.

2236
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:58,480

 

2237
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,910

When you do that, the scale doesn't

2238
00:55:59,910 --> 00:55:59,920
When you do that, the scale doesn't
 

2239
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,510
When you do that, the scale doesn't
change

2240
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520
change
 

2241
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,190
change
and now you're good.

2242
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:05,200
and now you're good.
 

2243
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,190
and now you're good.
Okay. Does everyone understand this

2244
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,200
Okay. Does everyone understand this
 

2245
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,109
Okay. Does everyone understand this
approach? Uh, any questions on this

2248
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:14,720

 

2249
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,349

>> No questions.

2254
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:19,040

2255
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:26,470

here. So let me make a comment. Comment.

2256
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:26,480

 

2257
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:36,710

This is not what PyTorch does.

2258
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:36,720

 

2259
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,190

Okay. So, uh what does PyTorch do? Uh

2260
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,200
Okay. So, uh what does PyTorch do? Uh
 

2261
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,069
Okay. So, uh what does PyTorch do? Uh
what PyTorch does is instead of doing

2262
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
what PyTorch does is instead of doing
 

2263
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,150
what PyTorch does is instead of doing
the multiplication at the end for quote

for test time, it does the
multiplication in advance at training

2268
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:52,799
multiplication in advance at training
 

2269
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,430
multiplication in advance at training
time.

2270
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:55,440
time.
 

2271
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,150
time.
So instead

2272
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:00,160

 

2273
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,630

Pytor torch

2274
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:02,640
Pytor torch
 

2275
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,150
Pytor torch
drop out

2276
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,160

 

2277
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,150

does this. The output of a dropout layer

2278
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,160
does this. The output of a dropout layer
 

2279
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,630
does this. The output of a dropout layer
at position J

2280
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
at position J
 

2281
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,549
at position J
is going to be zero

2282
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:18,559
is going to be zero
 

2283
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,549
is going to be zero
with probability 1 minus P

2284
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:22,559
with probability 1 minus P
 

2285
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,710
with probability 1 minus P
and it's going to be

2286
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:26,720
and it's going to be
 

2287
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,030
and it's going to be
H L

2288
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:29,040
H L
 

2289
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,150
H L
by you know at the same position J same

2290
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:32,160
by you know at the same position J same
 

2291
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,589
by you know at the same position J same
same same particular index J that we're

2292
00:57:33,589 --> 00:57:33,599
same same particular index J that we're
 

2293
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,670
same same particular index J that we're
talking about divided by P

2294
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:37,680
talking about divided by P
 

2295
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,750
talking about divided by P
with probability 1 minus P So it

2296
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:39,760
with probability 1 minus P So it
 

2297
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:45,270
with probability 1 minus P So it
probably P.

2298
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,280

 

2299
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,710

So it does the multiplication at the

2300
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:48,720
So it does the multiplication at the
 

2301
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,109
So it does the multiplication at the
time of training instead.

2302
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:51,119
time of training instead.
 

2303
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,549
time of training instead.
That way when you use the network at

2304
00:57:54,549 --> 00:57:54,559
That way when you use the network at
 

2305
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,430
That way when you use the network at
uh inference time, it's you don't need

2306
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:57,440
uh inference time, it's you don't need
 

2307
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,829
uh inference time, it's you don't need
to do the scaling.

2308
00:57:59,829 --> 00:57:59,839
to do the scaling.
 

2309
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,910
to do the scaling.
Does everyone understand?

2310
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:01,920
Does everyone understand?
 

2311
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,470
Does everyone understand?
It just it blows up the inputs during

2312
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:04,480
It just it blows up the inputs during
 

2313
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,910
It just it blows up the inputs during
training to be at the at the same scale

2314
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:05,920
training to be at the at the same scale
 

2315
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,190
training to be at the at the same scale
that they would have been had you done

2316
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,200
that they would have been had you done
 

2317
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:14,230
that they would have been had you done
no dropout. Here's

2318
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:14,240

 

2319
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,190

a question.

2320
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:15,200
a question.
 

2321
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,430
a question.
>> Okay. Yeah. Question.

2322
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:17,440
>> Okay. Yeah. Question.
 

2323
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,990
>> Okay. Yeah. Question.
>> Is there a benefit of doing one way over

2324
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,000
>> Is there a benefit of doing one way over
 

2325
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,990
>> Is there a benefit of doing one way over
the other like scaling at the end versus

2326
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:22,000
the other like scaling at the end versus
 

2327
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,670
the other like scaling at the end versus
scaling um like the between the layers

2328
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:25,680
scaling um like the between the layers
 

2329
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,069
scaling um like the between the layers
itself?

2330
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:28,079
itself?
 

2331
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:29,910
itself?
>> Uh great question. The question was is

2332
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:29,920
>> Uh great question. The question was is
 

2333
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,589
>> Uh great question. The question was is
there a difference between a benefit for

2334
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:31,599
there a difference between a benefit for
 

2335
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,589
there a difference between a benefit for
doing it one way or the other? Uh

2336
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:35,599
doing it one way or the other? Uh
 

2337
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,950
doing it one way or the other? Uh
in terms of mathematics they're

2338
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:36,960
in terms of mathematics they're
 

2339
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,630
in terms of mathematics they're
equivalent to each other.

2340
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:38,640
equivalent to each other.
 

2341
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,990
equivalent to each other.
Right? There's no difference between the

2342
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:40,000
Right? There's no difference between the
 

2343
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,470
Right? There's no difference between the
two mathematically. Uh practically

2344
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:42,480
two mathematically. Uh practically
 

2345
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,430
two mathematically. Uh practically
speaking, the PyTorch way is easier for

2346
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:45,440
speaking, the PyTorch way is easier for
 

2347
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,430
speaking, the PyTorch way is easier for
a practitioner because what it lets them

2348
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:47,440
a practitioner because what it lets them
 

2349
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,230
a practitioner because what it lets them
do is it lets them for example change

2350
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:50,240
do is it lets them for example change
 

2351
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,910
do is it lets them for example change
the dropout rate during training if they

2352
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:51,920
the dropout rate during training if they
 

2353
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,470
the dropout rate during training if they
wanted to have a higher dropout rate at

2354
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:54,480
wanted to have a higher dropout rate at
 

2355
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,789
wanted to have a higher dropout rate at
some points and a lower dropout later

2356
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:56,799
some points and a lower dropout later
 

2357
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,589
some points and a lower dropout later
and then still work.

2358
00:58:59,589 --> 00:58:59,599
and then still work.
 

2359
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:00,630
and then still work.
Really, you don't know what should I

2360
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:00,640
Really, you don't know what should I
 

2361
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,190
Really, you don't know what should I
what should I adjust it to? this way uh

2362
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:03,200
what should I adjust it to? this way uh
 

2363
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,230
what should I adjust it to? this way uh
you know it's just handled kind of at

2364
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:06,240
you know it's just handled kind of at
 

2365
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,309
you know it's just handled kind of at
training time as opposed to at a special

2366
00:59:08,309 --> 00:59:08,319
training time as opposed to at a special
 

2367
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:09,829
training time as opposed to at a special
step after training to set the right

2368
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:09,839
step after training to set the right
 

2369
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:13,190
step after training to set the right
dropout uh uh scale. Does that make

2370
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:13,200
dropout uh uh scale. Does that make
 

2371
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,390
dropout uh uh scale. Does that make
sense to people?

2372
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:16,400
sense to people?
 

2373
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,549
sense to people?
So practically speaking the PyTorch

2374
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:18,559
So practically speaking the PyTorch
 

2375
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,630
So practically speaking the PyTorch
approach is more useful for flexible uh

2376
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:20,640
approach is more useful for flexible uh
 

2377
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,510
approach is more useful for flexible uh
training recipes

2378
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:25,520

 

2379
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:33,190

which is why they do it.

2380
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:33,200

 

2381
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,670

Okay, great. So, I want to comment uh

2382
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:37,680
Okay, great. So, I want to comment uh
 

2383
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,069
Okay, great. So, I want to comment uh
that dropout as I said before is

2384
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:40,079
that dropout as I said before is
 

2385
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,630
that dropout as I said before is
typically used for MLP layers or MLP

2386
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:42,640
typically used for MLP layers or MLP
 

2387
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,789
typically used for MLP layers or MLP
like layers like one by one cons. There

2388
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:44,799
like layers like one by one cons. There
 

2389
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:48,390
like layers like one by one cons. There
are variants of dropout that are used uh

2390
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:48,400
are variants of dropout that are used uh
 

2391
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,470
are variants of dropout that are used uh
sometimes in some papers for image

2392
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:50,480
sometimes in some papers for image
 

2393
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,309
sometimes in some papers for image
processing which are basically you cut

2394
00:59:52,309 --> 00:59:52,319
processing which are basically you cut
 

2395
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,190
processing which are basically you cut
out entire blobs spatially but typically

2396
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:55,200
out entire blobs spatially but typically
 

2397
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,750
out entire blobs spatially but typically
dropout is not applied spatially uh in

2398
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:57,760
dropout is not applied spatially uh in
 

2399
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,390
dropout is not applied spatially uh in
in most uh training recipes that people

2400
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:00,400
in most uh training recipes that people
 

2401
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,870
in most uh training recipes that people
follow.

2402
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:02,880
follow.
 

2403
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,190
follow.
Uh okay. So now uh having uh talked

2404
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:07,200
Uh okay. So now uh having uh talked
 

2405
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,510
Uh okay. So now uh having uh talked
about dropout I want to move on to the

2406
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:09,520
about dropout I want to move on to the
 

2407
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,910
about dropout I want to move on to the
next question which is the next very

2408
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:11,920
next question which is the next very
 

2409
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,270
next question which is the next very
important thing for training is the

2410
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:13,280
important thing for training is the
 

2411
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,789
important thing for training is the
introduction of residual and skip

2412
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:14,799
introduction of residual and skip
 

2413
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,549
introduction of residual and skip
connections.

2414
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:16,559
connections.
 

2415
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,309
connections.
Okay

2416
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:18,319
Okay
 

2417
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,710
Okay
is any any questions before I move on to

2418
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:20,720
is any any questions before I move on to
 

2419
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,750
is any any questions before I move on to
make sure everyone understand we make

2420
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
make sure everyone understand we make
 

2421
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,789
make sure everyone understand we make
we'll give you homework problems to have

2422
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:22,799
we'll give you homework problems to have
 

2423
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:23,990
we'll give you homework problems to have
you work out analytically what happens

2424
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:24,000
you work out analytically what happens
 

2425
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,150
you work out analytically what happens
to dropout. You'll see it in code and

2426
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:26,160
to dropout. You'll see it in code and
 

2427
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,589
to dropout. You'll see it in code and
you'll get a better better familiarity

2428
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:27,599
you'll get a better better familiarity
 

2429
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,349
you'll get a better better familiarity
with it.

2430
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:29,359
with it.
 

2431
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,750
with it.
>> I think you're good.

2432
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:31,760
>> I think you're good.
 

2433
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,710
>> I think you're good.
>> Okay. Good. So now I want to talk about

2434
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:34,720
>> Okay. Good. So now I want to talk about
 

2435
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,349
>> Okay. Good. So now I want to talk about
uh skip connections. So the first way

2436
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:39,359
uh skip connections. So the first way
 

2437
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,990
uh skip connections. So the first way
so in in the history of neural nets what

2438
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,000
so in in the history of neural nets what
 

2439
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,309
so in in the history of neural nets what
happened was people said okay great

2440
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:44,319
happened was people said okay great
 

2441
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:46,549
happened was people said okay great
networks are doing amazing um we have

2442
01:00:46,549 --> 01:00:46,559
networks are doing amazing um we have
 

2443
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,870
networks are doing amazing um we have
these ideas of normalization uh that

2444
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:48,880
these ideas of normalization uh that
 

2445
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,390
these ideas of normalization uh that
will work and let us train these things.

2446
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:50,400
will work and let us train these things.
 

2447
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,950
will work and let us train these things.
We have dropout which seems to help with

2448
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:52,960
We have dropout which seems to help with
 

2449
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,549
We have dropout which seems to help with
generalization

2450
01:00:54,549 --> 01:00:54,559
generalization
 

2451
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,069
generalization
and we are we're doing fine and we're

2452
01:00:58,069 --> 01:00:58,079
and we are we're doing fine and we're
 

2453
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,670
and we are we're doing fine and we're
seeing that bigger networks are working

2454
01:00:59,670 --> 01:00:59,680
seeing that bigger networks are working
 

2455
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,670
seeing that bigger networks are working
better. So then people started saying

2456
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:01,680
better. So then people started saying
 

2457
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,390
better. So then people started saying
let's make our network more and more

2458
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:04,400
let's make our network more and more
 

2459
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,670
let's make our network more and more
layers long more and more layers deep

2460
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:07,680
layers long more and more layers deep
 

2461
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,190
layers long more and more layers deep
and suddenly they experienced this

2462
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:09,200
and suddenly they experienced this
 

2463
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,990
and suddenly they experienced this
phenomena which is captured here. So uh

2464
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:12,000
phenomena which is captured here. So uh
 

2465
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,309
phenomena which is captured here. So uh
if everyone looks on the figure the

2466
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:14,319
if everyone looks on the figure the
 

2467
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:16,710
if everyone looks on the figure the
first thing they saw sometimes when they

2468
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:16,720
first thing they saw sometimes when they
 

2469
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,309
first thing they saw sometimes when they
trained a network and they looked at

2470
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:20,319
trained a network and they looked at
 

2471
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,710
trained a network and they looked at
what was going on with the test error.

2472
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:22,720
what was going on with the test error.
 

2473
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,829
what was going on with the test error.
So for test error lower is better.

2474
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:25,839
So for test error lower is better.
 

2475
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:29,349
So for test error lower is better.
A smaller network was doing better than

2476
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:29,359
A smaller network was doing better than
 

2477
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,630
A smaller network was doing better than
a larger network.

2478
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:32,640
a larger network.
 

2479
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,630
a larger network.
So it didn't sometimes scale didn't seem

2480
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:34,640
So it didn't sometimes scale didn't seem
 

2481
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,309
So it didn't sometimes scale didn't seem
to help. Making the network deeper

2482
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:36,319
to help. Making the network deeper
 

2483
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:39,349
to help. Making the network deeper
didn't help. In fact, it made it worse.

2484
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:39,359
didn't help. In fact, it made it worse.
 

2485
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,030
didn't help. In fact, it made it worse.
So if this is all that people were

2486
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:41,040
So if this is all that people were
 

2487
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,109
So if this is all that people were
looking at, they would have said, "Oh,

2488
01:01:43,109 --> 01:01:43,119
looking at, they would have said, "Oh,
 

2489
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,950
looking at, they would have said, "Oh,
maybe I've made the network too big and

2490
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:44,960
maybe I've made the network too big and
 

2491
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,309
maybe I've made the network too big and
I'm getting some kind of overfitting

2492
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:46,319
I'm getting some kind of overfitting
 

2493
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,710
I'm getting some kind of overfitting
effect that's going on. My network is

2494
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:48,720
effect that's going on. My network is
 

2495
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,109
effect that's going on. My network is
just too big for my data size." which is

2496
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:51,119
just too big for my data size." which is
 

2497
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,390
just too big for my data size." which is
something you you've a lot about and

2498
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:52,400
something you you've a lot about and
 

2499
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,829
something you you've a lot about and
heard from your in your machine learning

2500
01:01:53,829 --> 01:01:53,839
heard from your in your machine learning
 

2501
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:57,750
heard from your in your machine learning
class but people said hey let's look at

2502
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:57,760
class but people said hey let's look at
 

2503
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,109
class but people said hey let's look at
the training data too the training error

2504
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:01,119
the training data too the training error
 

2505
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,670
the training data too the training error
so overfitting is characterized over is

2506
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:03,680
so overfitting is characterized over is
 

2507
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,589
so overfitting is characterized over is
characterized by training error is

2508
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:05,599
characterized by training error is
 

2509
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,950
characterized by training error is
better but test error is worse remember

2510
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:08,960
better but test error is worse remember
 

2511
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,109
better but test error is worse remember
everyone's with me on that what they saw

2512
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:11,119
everyone's with me on that what they saw
 

2513
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,109
everyone's with me on that what they saw
was that with when they were training

2514
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:13,119
was that with when they were training
 

2515
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,190
was that with when they were training
these deeper networks even the training

2516
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:15,200
these deeper networks even the training
 

2517
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,630
these deeper networks even the training
error was worse

2518
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:18,640

 

2519
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,950

and so whenever you do something that

2520
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:20,960
and so whenever you do something that
 

2521
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,349
and so whenever you do something that
training error gets worse. In a standard

2522
01:02:23,349 --> 01:02:23,359
training error gets worse. In a standard
 

2523
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:26,150
training error gets worse. In a standard
ML point of view, this is usually a

2524
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:26,160
ML point of view, this is usually a
 

2525
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,750
ML point of view, this is usually a
symptom of something that you think of

2526
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:27,760
symptom of something that you think of
 

2527
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,630
symptom of something that you think of
as being underfitting.

2528
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:30,640
as being underfitting.
 

2529
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,710
as being underfitting.
Make a comment here. So, this figure

2530
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:34,720
Make a comment here. So, this figure
 

2531
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:47,670
Make a comment here. So, this figure
feels like underfitting.

2532
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:47,680

 

2533
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,589

Okay. Any questions on this? It wants to

2534
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:49,599
Okay. Any questions on this? It wants to
 

2535
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,870
Okay. Any questions on this? It wants to
understand this intuition of what's

2536
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:50,880
understand this intuition of what's
 

2537
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,230
understand this intuition of what's
going on connecting to the standard

2538
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:52,240
going on connecting to the standard
 

2539
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:58,390
going on connecting to the standard
machine learning intuition.

2540
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:58,400

 

2541
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,910

Okay, I don't see see any questions or

2542
01:02:59,910 --> 01:02:59,920
Okay, I don't see see any questions or
 

2543
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,030
Okay, I don't see see any questions or
any hands going up. So, uh when

2544
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:03,040
any hands going up. So, uh when
 

2545
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,270
any hands going up. So, uh when
something but it's kind of weird, right?

2546
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:05,280
something but it's kind of weird, right?
 

2547
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,990
something but it's kind of weird, right?
My network is bigger, but I'm getting

2548
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:08,000
My network is bigger, but I'm getting
 

2549
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,710
My network is bigger, but I'm getting
something that feels like underfitting.

2550
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:10,720
something that feels like underfitting.
 

2551
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,750
something that feels like underfitting.
So, traditionally in your ML class, you

2552
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:13,760
So, traditionally in your ML class, you
 

2553
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,789
So, traditionally in your ML class, you
said that you thought that when a

2554
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:14,799
said that you thought that when a
 

2555
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:16,069
said that you thought that when a
network gets bigger, you're more prone

2556
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:16,079
network gets bigger, you're more prone
 

2557
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,109
network gets bigger, you're more prone
to overfitits, not under fits.

2558
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:19,119
to overfitits, not under fits.
 

2559
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:22,150
to overfitits, not under fits.
So something must be happening.

2560
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:22,160
So something must be happening.
 

2561
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:26,150
So something must be happening.
Uh so somehow adding this depth to the

2562
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:26,160
Uh so somehow adding this depth to the
 

2563
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,750
Uh so somehow adding this depth to the
network was making it train poorly.

2564
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:29,760
network was making it train poorly.
 

2565
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,910
network was making it train poorly.
So to see what would why that might be

2566
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:31,920
So to see what would why that might be
 

2567
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,470
So to see what would why that might be
happening, we have to look um at what's

2568
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:34,480
happening, we have to look um at what's
 

2569
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,510
happening, we have to look um at what's
going on in a deeper network. Okay. So

2570
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:37,520
going on in a deeper network. Okay. So
 

2571
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,430
going on in a deeper network. Okay. So
hopefully everyone can see this picture.

2572
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:39,440
hopefully everyone can see this picture.
 

2573
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,670
hopefully everyone can see this picture.
It's like a a stylized picture of what's

2574
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:41,680
It's like a a stylized picture of what's
 

2575
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,270
It's like a a stylized picture of what's
going on in a deep network. You have an

2576
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:43,280
going on in a deep network. You have an
 

2577
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,430
going on in a deep network. You have an
input. It goes through layer after layer

2578
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:45,440
input. It goes through layer after layer
 

2579
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,029
input. It goes through layer after layer
after layer after layer after layer in

2580
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:47,039
after layer after layer after layer in
 

2581
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,190
after layer after layer after layer in
the forward pass. Finally get an output

2582
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:49,200
the forward pass. Finally get an output
 

2583
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,349
the forward pass. Finally get an output
layer. The output layer is then passed

2584
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:51,359
layer. The output layer is then passed
 

2585
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,309
layer. The output layer is then passed
to a loss layer and the loss layer

2586
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:54,319
to a loss layer and the loss layer
 

2587
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,470
to a loss layer and the loss layer
computes a gradient

2588
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:56,480
computes a gradient
 

2589
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,549
computes a gradient
and then that gradient is backed

2590
01:03:58,549 --> 01:03:58,559
and then that gradient is backed
 

2591
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,190
and then that gradient is backed
backwards through the network to tell

2592
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,200
backwards through the network to tell
 

2593
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,630
backwards through the network to tell
you how to adjust the weights.

2594
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:04,640
you how to adjust the weights.
 

2595
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,829
you how to adjust the weights.
Everyone good with that?

2596
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:07,839
Everyone good with that?
 

2597
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:11,430
Everyone good with that?
Okay. So

2598
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:11,440
Okay. So
 

2599
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,670
Okay. So
something in the network when you add

2600
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:13,680
something in the network when you add
 

2601
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,549
something in the network when you add
more and more depth to the network was

2602
01:04:16,549 --> 01:04:16,559
more and more depth to the network was
 

2603
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,190
more and more depth to the network was
making it behave like underfitting.

2604
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:19,200
making it behave like underfitting.
 

2605
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,630
making it behave like underfitting.
And there's actually two different uh

2606
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:22,640
And there's actually two different uh
 

2607
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,309
And there's actually two different uh
pictures or interpretations of what's

2608
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:24,319
pictures or interpretations of what's
 

2609
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,109
pictures or interpretations of what's
going on in these settings.

2610
01:04:27,109 --> 01:04:27,119
going on in these settings.
 

2611
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,789
going on in these settings.
The first picture says look what's

2612
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:30,799
The first picture says look what's
 

2613
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,390
The first picture says look what's
happening what might be happening is

2614
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:32,400
happening what might be happening is
 

2615
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,789
happening what might be happening is
that this backdrop gradient is getting

2616
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:34,799
that this backdrop gradient is getting
 

2617
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,950
that this backdrop gradient is getting
multiplied by transposes of matrices

2618
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:36,960
multiplied by transposes of matrices
 

2619
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,270
multiplied by transposes of matrices
spiritually every time as you go

2620
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:39,280
spiritually every time as you go
 

2621
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,349
spiritually every time as you go
backward through a layer.

2622
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:43,359
backward through a layer.
 

2623
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,870
backward through a layer.
Everyone with me on that? Okay. So

2624
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:46,880
Everyone with me on that? Okay. So
 

2625
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,230
Everyone with me on that? Okay. So
you're still multiplying lots of

2626
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:48,240
you're still multiplying lots of
 

2627
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,589
you're still multiplying lots of
matrices together. And one thing that

2628
01:04:49,589 --> 01:04:49,599
matrices together. And one thing that
 

2629
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:50,710
matrices together. And one thing that
can happen when you multiply lots of

2630
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
can happen when you multiply lots of
 

2631
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,950
can happen when you multiply lots of
matrices together is that they actually

2632
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:52,960
matrices together is that they actually
 

2633
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,870
matrices together is that they actually
things go to zero. So this could be

2634
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,880
things go to zero. So this could be
 

2635
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,309
things go to zero. So this could be
decaying gradients, could be dying

2636
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:56,319
decaying gradients, could be dying
 

2637
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:16,150
decaying gradients, could be dying
gradients.

2638
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:16,160

 

2639
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,789

And so the question people had was that

2640
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:18,799
And so the question people had was that
 

2641
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:20,069
And so the question people had was that
okay, maybe there's something I can do

2642
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:20,079
okay, maybe there's something I can do
 

2643
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:21,510
okay, maybe there's something I can do
about this to make the gradients not

2644
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:21,520
about this to make the gradients not
 

2645
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,910
about this to make the gradients not
die. But there's a different perspective

2646
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:23,920
die. But there's a different perspective
 

2647
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,870
die. But there's a different perspective
also that you should be aware of.

2648
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:26,880
also that you should be aware of.
 

2649
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,430
also that you should be aware of.
Uh the different perspective is that

2650
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:29,440
Uh the different perspective is that
 

2651
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,430
Uh the different perspective is that
when you start this model at random

2652
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:31,440
when you start this model at random
 

2653
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,950
when you start this model at random
initialization, so this is random

2654
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:32,960
initialization, so this is random
 

2655
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,470
initialization, so this is random
initialized, this is random initialized.

2656
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:34,480
initialized, this is random initialized.
 

2657
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,750
initialized, this is random initialized.
Everything is randomly initialized

2658
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:35,760
Everything is randomly initialized
 

2659
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,349
Everything is randomly initialized
including the output layer.

2660
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:39,359
including the output layer.
 

2661
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:42,069
including the output layer.
So none of these really know what

2662
01:05:42,069 --> 01:05:42,079
So none of these really know what
 

2663
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,069
So none of these really know what
they're doing.

2664
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:44,079
they're doing.
 

2665
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,750
they're doing.
Okay?

2666
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:45,760
Okay?
 

2667
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,910
Okay?
And the loss layer of course knows

2668
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:47,920
And the loss layer of course knows
 

2669
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,589
And the loss layer of course knows
exactly what to do. So it says it passes

2670
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:49,599
exactly what to do. So it says it passes
 

2671
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,069
exactly what to do. So it says it passes
a gradient back to the output layer.

2672
01:05:52,069 --> 01:05:52,079
a gradient back to the output layer.
 

2673
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,870
a gradient back to the output layer.
But then when the output layer passes a

2674
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:54,880
But then when the output layer passes a
 

2675
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,870
But then when the output layer passes a
gradient back to the next layer, you

2676
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:56,880
gradient back to the next layer, you
 

2677
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,710
gradient back to the next layer, you
should if you want to anthropomorphize

2678
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:58,720
should if you want to anthropomorphize
 

2679
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,150
should if you want to anthropomorphize
it, it goes like this. Well, I really

2680
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
it, it goes like this. Well, I really
 

2681
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,230
it, it goes like this. Well, I really
don't know what I'm doing. I'm randomly

2682
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:04,240
don't know what I'm doing. I'm randomly
 

2683
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,270
don't know what I'm doing. I'm randomly
initialized. But assuming that I'm

2684
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:07,280
initialized. But assuming that I'm
 

2685
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,829
initialized. But assuming that I'm
actually the right thing, this is how I

2686
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:09,839
actually the right thing, this is how I
 

2687
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,950
actually the right thing, this is how I
want you to change earlier layer so that

2688
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:12,960
want you to change earlier layer so that
 

2689
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,950
want you to change earlier layer so that
I get something that's useful for me

2690
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:14,960
I get something that's useful for me
 

2691
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,309
I get something that's useful for me
relative to this loss.

2692
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:18,319
relative to this loss.
 

2693
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:19,990
relative to this loss.
Everyone kind of understands

2694
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:20,000
Everyone kind of understands
 

2695
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,750
Everyone kind of understands
anthropomorphizing of what backrop is

2696
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:21,760
anthropomorphizing of what backrop is
 

2697
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,549
anthropomorphizing of what backrop is
doing. And then the next layer says,

2698
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:24,559
doing. And then the next layer says,
 

2699
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,109
doing. And then the next layer says,
okay, I don't really know what I'm

2700
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:27,119
okay, I don't really know what I'm
 

2701
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,349
okay, I don't really know what I'm
doing. I'm just randomly initialized.

2702
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:29,359
doing. I'm just randomly initialized.
 

2703
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:30,950
doing. I'm just randomly initialized.
But the next guy tells me that he'd like

2704
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:30,960
But the next guy tells me that he'd like
 

2705
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,670
But the next guy tells me that he'd like
his outputs like this. And when I think

2706
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:33,680
his outputs like this. And when I think
 

2707
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,510
his outputs like this. And when I think
of how what would make me give outputs

2708
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:35,520
of how what would make me give outputs
 

2709
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,670
of how what would make me give outputs
like that, I'll pass on another message

2710
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:37,680
like that, I'll pass on another message
 

2711
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,230
like that, I'll pass on another message
back to the previous layer. So what you

2712
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:40,240
back to the previous layer. So what you
 

2713
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,789
back to the previous layer. So what you
have at another kind of intuitive level

2714
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:42,799
have at another kind of intuitive level
 

2715
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,390
have at another kind of intuitive level
is

2716
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400
is
 

2717
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,670
is
a game of gradient telephone being paid

2718
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:47,680
a game of gradient telephone being paid
 

2719
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,190
a game of gradient telephone being paid
played back through this network where

2720
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:51,200
played back through this network where
 

2721
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,670
played back through this network where
none of the thing really know what

2722
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:53,680
none of the thing really know what
 

2723
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,190
none of the thing really know what
they're doing. And so by the end later

2724
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:57,200
they're doing. And so by the end later
 

2725
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,309
they're doing. And so by the end later
parts of this network what you're

2726
01:06:58,309 --> 01:06:58,319
parts of this network what you're
 

2727
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,510
parts of this network what you're
getting are gradients that are

2728
01:06:59,510 --> 01:06:59,520
getting are gradients that are
 

2729
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,870
getting are gradients that are
essentially you know random

2730
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:02,880
essentially you know random
 

2731
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,470
essentially you know random
in terms of what what what direction

2732
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:04,480
in terms of what what what direction
 

2733
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,230
in terms of what what what direction
they're pointing in relative to what you

2734
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:06,240
they're pointing in relative to what you
 

2735
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,630
they're pointing in relative to what you
actually want.

2736
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:08,640
actually want.
 

2737
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,470
actually want.
Okay, there's a different perspective on

2738
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:10,480
Okay, there's a different perspective on
 

2739
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,990
Okay, there's a different perspective on
what could be happening here. So it

2740
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,000
what could be happening here. So it
 

2741
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,710
what could be happening here. So it
could be dying gradients

2742
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:14,720
could be dying gradients
 

2743
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,270
could be dying gradients
or it could be you know this doesn't

2744
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:17,280
or it could be you know this doesn't
 

2745
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,430
or it could be you know this doesn't
have any uh standard name you know uh

2746
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:21,440
have any uh standard name you know uh
 

2747
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:29,430
have any uh standard name you know uh
confused gradients.

2748
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:29,440

 

2749
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,750

And so in this picture, what happens is

2750
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:31,760
And so in this picture, what happens is
 

2751
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,710
And so in this picture, what happens is
that the in the confused gradients

2752
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:34,720
that the in the confused gradients
 

2753
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,309
that the in the confused gradients
picture, what happens is the last last

2754
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:36,319
picture, what happens is the last last
 

2755
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,230
picture, what happens is the last last
layer might tune to something, but then

2756
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:38,240
layer might tune to something, but then
 

2757
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,190
layer might tune to something, but then
all the other layers are just in not uh

2758
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:41,200
all the other layers are just in not uh
 

2759
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,789
all the other layers are just in not uh
very good shape during training because

2760
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:42,799
very good shape during training because
 

2761
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:43,829
very good shape during training because
they don't really know what they're

2762
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:43,839
they don't really know what they're
 

2763
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,510
they don't really know what they're
doing.

2764
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:45,520
doing.
 

2765
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,589
doing.
Okay, so there's two reasons that what

2766
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:47,599
Okay, so there's two reasons that what
 

2767
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,589
Okay, so there's two reasons that what
what can one can do, but people

2768
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:49,599
what can one can do, but people
 

2769
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,190
what can one can do, but people
intuitively focused in on the dying

2770
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,200
intuitively focused in on the dying
 

2771
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,910
intuitively focused in on the dying
gradient problem because it was more

2772
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:53,920
gradient problem because it was more
 

2773
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,430
gradient problem because it was more
amendable to some problem that they know

2774
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:55,440
amendable to some problem that they know
 

2775
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,670
amendable to some problem that they know
how to solve.

2776
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:57,680
how to solve.
 

2777
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,230
how to solve.
Okay. So,

2778
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:00,240
Okay. So,
 

2779
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,190
Okay. So,
what was the idea?

2780
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:03,200
what was the idea?
 

2781
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,510
what was the idea?
The idea was,

2782
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520
The idea was,
 

2783
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:10,150
The idea was,
wouldn't it be great

2784
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:10,160

 

2785
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,309

if we could somehow get this gradient

2786
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:12,319
if we could somehow get this gradient
 

2787
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:13,910
if we could somehow get this gradient
here

2788
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:13,920
here
 

2789
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,149
here
to go back all the way because that's

2790
01:08:16,149 --> 01:08:16,159
to go back all the way because that's
 

2791
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:20,870
to go back all the way because that's
definitely a good gradient to go Oops.

2792
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:20,880
definitely a good gradient to go Oops.
 

2793
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,349
definitely a good gradient to go Oops.
to go all the way back earlier in the

2794
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:23,359
to go all the way back earlier in the
 

2795
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:27,829
to go all the way back earlier in the
network.

2796
01:08:27,829 --> 01:08:27,839

 

2797
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:32,630

So the desire

2798
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:32,640

 

2799
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,709

was to create

2800
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:36,719

 

2801
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:41,030

uh

2802
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:41,040

 

2803
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:47,269

gradient superighway

2804
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:47,279

 

2805
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,630

that would take gradients back to

2806
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:50,640
that would take gradients back to
 

2807
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,070
that would take gradients back to
everybody. That would be good gradients.

2808
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:54,080
everybody. That would be good gradients.
 

2809
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,749
everybody. That would be good gradients.
And so you can think of it as one

2810
01:08:57,749 --> 01:08:57,759
And so you can think of it as one
 

2811
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,749
And so you can think of it as one
approach. Remember gradients follow the

2812
01:08:59,749 --> 01:08:59,759
approach. Remember gradients follow the
 

2813
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,829
approach. Remember gradients follow the
activations, right? If you have a

2814
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:01,839
activations, right? If you have a
 

2815
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,070
activations, right? If you have a
forward p edge, you get a gradient edge

2816
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:04,080
forward p edge, you get a gradient edge
 

2817
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,950
forward p edge, you get a gradient edge
going back. So one approach that people

2818
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:06,960
going back. So one approach that people
 

2819
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,870
going back. So one approach that people
said is okay, I know how I can do this.

2820
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:10,880
said is okay, I know how I can do this.
 

2821
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,390
said is okay, I know how I can do this.
I might not be able to get stuff all the

2822
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:12,400
I might not be able to get stuff all the
 

2823
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,669
I might not be able to get stuff all the
way from the output layer, but maybe I

2824
01:09:13,669 --> 01:09:13,679
way from the output layer, but maybe I
 

2825
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,149
way from the output layer, but maybe I
can get it from back here. Is why don't

2826
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:16,159
can get it from back here. Is why don't
 

2827
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:22,870
can get it from back here. Is why don't
I add a link? So I say I'll add a link

2828
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:22,880

 

2829
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,990

that looks like this.

2830
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:26,000
that looks like this.
 

2831
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,910
that looks like this.
Right from the beginning, it sends

2832
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:27,920
Right from the beginning, it sends
 

2833
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,030
Right from the beginning, it sends
things all the way through uh coming

2834
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:31,040
things all the way through uh coming
 

2835
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,749
things all the way through uh coming
over here to the thing before the output

2836
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:33,759
over here to the thing before the output
 

2837
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:37,430
over here to the thing before the output
layer. If I did this intuitively, the

2838
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:37,440
layer. If I did this intuitively, the
 

2839
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,829
layer. If I did this intuitively, the
gradient in addition to taking a path

2840
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
gradient in addition to taking a path
 

2841
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:43,269
gradient in addition to taking a path
like this through the network would also

2842
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:43,279
like this through the network would also
 

2843
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:47,669
like this through the network would also
just go back straight to this layer.

2844
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
just go back straight to this layer.
 

2845
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,309
just go back straight to this layer.
Everyone with me?

2846
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:50,319
Everyone with me?
 

2847
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,149
Everyone with me?
And so why, you know, why stop there?

2848
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:54,159
And so why, you know, why stop there?
 

2849
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:56,950
And so why, you know, why stop there?
Why don't we also add

2850
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:56,960
Why don't we also add
 

2851
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,950
Why don't we also add
this path

2852
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
this path
 

2853
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,510
this path
and

2854
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:01,520
and
 

2855
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:06,790
and
this path and this path too?

2856
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:06,800
this path and this path too?
 

2857
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,350
this path and this path too?
If we did this hypothetically, what

2858
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:09,360
If we did this hypothetically, what
 

2859
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,910
If we did this hypothetically, what
would happen is that the gradient that

2860
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:11,920
would happen is that the gradient that
 

2861
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,430
would happen is that the gradient that
comes through the output layer would

2862
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:13,440
comes through the output layer would
 

2863
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,430
comes through the output layer would
then go back to every single block.

2864
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:17,440
then go back to every single block.
 

2865
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,470
then go back to every single block.
Okay, is everyone with me with the idea

2866
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:20,480
Okay, is everyone with me with the idea
 

2867
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,270
Okay, is everyone with me with the idea
of doing this?

2868
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:23,280
of doing this?
 

2869
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,229
of doing this?
And so you say, okay, then the output

2870
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:26,239
And so you say, okay, then the output
 

2871
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:27,910
And so you say, okay, then the output
layers gradients would come back and

2872
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:27,920
layers gradients would come back and
 

2873
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,149
layers gradients would come back and
every single block here would have some

2874
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:30,159
every single block here would have some
 

2875
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,950
every single block here would have some
signal at least that's not too far down

2876
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:32,960
signal at least that's not too far down
 

2877
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,350
signal at least that's not too far down
the telephone pole, you know, kind of uh

2878
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:35,360
the telephone pole, you know, kind of uh
 

2879
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:40,310
the telephone pole, you know, kind of uh
line from the uh actual loss.

2880
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:40,320
line from the uh actual loss.
 

2881
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,790
line from the uh actual loss.
And then you say, okay, but what about

2882
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:42,800
And then you say, okay, but what about
 

2883
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,630
And then you say, okay, but what about
gradings to help this guy? So you go,

2884
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:44,640
gradings to help this guy? So you go,
 

2885
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,990
gradings to help this guy? So you go,
fine, let's do the same thing for this

2886
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,000
fine, let's do the same thing for this
 

2887
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,709
fine, let's do the same thing for this
guy. So let's add links.

2888
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:50,719
guy. So let's add links.
 

2889
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,390
guy. So let's add links.
Oops.

2890
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:52,400
Oops.
 

2891
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:59,990
Oops.
Let's add links like this.

2892
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:00,000

 

2893
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,229

Okay. So

2894
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:04,239

 

2895
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,790

idea one is

2896
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:06,800
idea one is
 

2897
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,669
idea one is
add links

2898
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:11,679

 

2899
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:15,350

from output

2900
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:15,360

 

2901
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:22,070

of all earlier layers

2902
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:22,080

 

2903
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,350

to the input

2904
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:25,360
to the input
 

2905
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:33,270
to the input
of a given layer.

2906
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:33,280

 

2907
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,270

Okay, so hopefully this what that does

2908
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:37,280
Okay, so hopefully this what that does
 

2909
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,430
Okay, so hopefully this what that does
it creates a grading superighway.

2910
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:39,440
it creates a grading superighway.
 

2911
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,229
it creates a grading superighway.
Unfortunately, it has a huge negative

2912
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:42,239
Unfortunately, it has a huge negative
 

2913
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,950
Unfortunately, it has a huge negative
effect which is it means that the input

2914
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:44,960
effect which is it means that the input
 

2915
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,750
effect which is it means that the input
that what's coming in over here is the

2916
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:47,760
that what's coming in over here is the
 

2917
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,350
that what's coming in over here is the
sum of many many things. So if you think

2918
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
sum of many many things. So if you think
 

2919
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,430
sum of many many things. So if you think
of this network as being 50 things deep,

2920
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:51,440
of this network as being 50 things deep,
 

2921
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,189
of this network as being 50 things deep,
50 different things are adding up

2922
01:11:53,189 --> 01:11:53,199
50 different things are adding up
 

2923
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:55,350
50 different things are adding up
directly over here and so it's getting

2924
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:55,360
directly over here and so it's getting
 

2925
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,669
directly over here and so it's getting
bigger. But if not just the 50 things

2926
01:11:57,669 --> 01:11:57,679
bigger. But if not just the 50 things
 

2927
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,750
bigger. But if not just the 50 things
are adding up over here, that 49 things

2928
01:11:59,750 --> 01:11:59,760
are adding up over here, that 49 things
 

2929
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,310
are adding up over here, that 49 things
are adding up here. And so if 49 things

2930
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:02,320
are adding up here. And so if 49 things
 

2931
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,510
are adding up here. And so if 49 things
add up here and then it goes through

2932
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:03,520
add up here and then it goes through
 

2933
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,110
add up here and then it goes through
this layer, it gets even bigger

2934
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:05,120
this layer, it gets even bigger
 

2935
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,270
this layer, it gets even bigger
potentially.

2936
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:07,280
potentially.
 

2937
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:26,709
potentially.
So this blows up.

2938
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:26,719

 

2939
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,110

Okay, so that doesn't work. But then

2940
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:29,120
Okay, so that doesn't work. But then
 

2941
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,430
Okay, so that doesn't work. But then
people realize that

2942
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:31,440
people realize that
 

2943
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,229
people realize that
all I really care about is the idea that

2944
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:34,239
all I really care about is the idea that
 

2945
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:36,709
all I really care about is the idea that
there should be a gradient superighway.

2946
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
there should be a gradient superighway.
 

2947
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,390
there should be a gradient superighway.
So I have a different idea that I can

2948
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:38,400
So I have a different idea that I can
 

2949
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,510
So I have a different idea that I can
do,

2950
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:41,520

 

2951
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,709

which is to just add a more minimalist

2952
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:44,719
which is to just add a more minimalist
 

2953
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,149
which is to just add a more minimalist
set of connections. So to this output

2954
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
set of connections. So to this output
 

2955
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:54,470
set of connections. So to this output
just add this guy

2956
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,480

 

2957
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,390

and to the input of here just add

2958
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:58,400
and to the input of here just add
 

2959
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,630
and to the input of here just add
this guy.

2960
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:02,640

 

2961
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,189

Oops.

2962
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:05,199
Oops.
 

2963
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:09,510
Oops.
Yeah.

2964
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:09,520

 

2965
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:17,750

and so on.

2966
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:17,760

 

2967
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,030

Okay. And these are called skip

2968
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:19,040
Okay. And these are called skip
 

2969
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:27,669
Okay. And these are called skip
connections.

2970
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:27,679

 

2971
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:31,590

They add

2972
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:31,600

 

2973
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,229

input

2974
01:13:34,229 --> 01:13:34,239
input
 

2975
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:38,709
input
to the output

2976
01:13:38,709 --> 01:13:38,719

 

2977
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:45,590

of a layer.

2978
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:45,600

 

2979
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,550

So what do skip connections do? skip

2980
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:48,560
So what do skip connections do? skip
 

2981
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,310
So what do skip connections do? skip
connections. I'll create a path by which

2982
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:50,320
connections. I'll create a path by which
 

2983
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,590
connections. I'll create a path by which
the gradient can actually go all the way

2984
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:53,600
the gradient can actually go all the way
 

2985
01:13:53,600 --> 01:14:02,310
the gradient can actually go all the way
back to everybody

2986
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:02,320

 

2987
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,390

and this creates a path for the

2988
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:04,400
and this creates a path for the
 

2989
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,790
and this creates a path for the
gradients and this turns out to work. So

2990
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:06,800
gradients and this turns out to work. So
 

2991
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,669
gradients and this turns out to work. So
next time I will finish up resets and

2992
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:09,679
next time I will finish up resets and
 

2993
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,430
next time I will finish up resets and
then uh continue uh forward on you know

2994
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:13,440
then uh continue uh forward on you know
 

2995
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,750
then uh continue uh forward on you know
fully convolutional networks and the

2996
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:15,760
fully convolutional networks and the
 

2997
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,910
fully convolutional networks and the
like. Okay, I'm out of time. So, I'll

2998
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:19,920
like. Okay, I'm out of time. So, I'll
 

2999
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,149
like. Okay, I'm out of time. So, I'll
just take uh a last question if there's

3000
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:22,159
just take uh a last question if there's
 

3001
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,470
just take uh a last question if there's
one, but then I'll stand.

3002
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
one, but then I'll stand.
 

3003
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:33,750
one, but then I'll stand.
>> Uh yeah, there's one question.

3004
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:33,760

 

3005
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,390

>> Oh, hi. Um, if you were to take this

3006
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:36,400
>> Oh, hi. Um, if you were to take this
 

3007
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,149
>> Oh, hi. Um, if you were to take this
minimalist approach, why wouldn't you

3008
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:38,159
minimalist approach, why wouldn't you
 

3009
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,990
minimalist approach, why wouldn't you
just draw like the connection like

3010
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:40,000
just draw like the connection like
 

3011
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,189
just draw like the connection like
straight like from I like I I I guess

3012
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:43,199
straight like from I like I I I guess
 

3013
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,189
straight like from I like I I I guess
like from every edge to like to right

3014
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:45,199
like from every edge to like to right
 

3015
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:46,790
like from every edge to like to right
before the output layer like why why

3016
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:46,800
before the output layer like why why
 

3017
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,110
before the output layer like why why
would you just draw it like from one to

3018
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,120
would you just draw it like from one to
 

3019
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,270
would you just draw it like from one to
the next and to the next and so on if

3020
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:51,280
the next and to the next and so on if
 

3021
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,910
the next and to the next and so on if
that makes sense.

3022
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:53,920
that makes sense.
 

3023
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,310
that makes sense.
>> So uh in this picture the way the skip

3024
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:56,320
>> So uh in this picture the way the skip
 

3025
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,470
>> So uh in this picture the way the skip
connections are drawn is they always go

3026
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:58,480
connections are drawn is they always go
 

3027
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,990
connections are drawn is they always go
skipping over a particular layer.

3028
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:02,000
skipping over a particular layer.
 

3029
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,350
skipping over a particular layer.
We'll talk more about the inside of the

3030
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:03,360
We'll talk more about the inside of the
 

3031
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,070
We'll talk more about the inside of the
layer later, but uh that's the

3032
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:06,080
layer later, but uh that's the
 

3033
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,149
layer later, but uh that's the
minimalist approach. Are you asking for

3034
01:15:08,149 --> 01:15:08,159
minimalist approach. Are you asking for
 

3035
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,070
minimalist approach. Are you asking for
them all just to go to the end the be

3036
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:10,080
them all just to go to the end the be
 

3037
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,669
them all just to go to the end the be
the beginning the thing that's going in

3038
01:15:11,669 --> 01:15:11,679
the beginning the thing that's going in
 

3039
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:12,790
the beginning the thing that's going in
the output layer?

3040
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:12,800
the output layer?
 

3041
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,950
the output layer?
>> Yeah. Yeah.

3042
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:14,960
>> Yeah. Yeah.
 

3043
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,470
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Okay. So, we we added that at the we

3044
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:16,480
>> Okay. So, we we added that at the we
 

3045
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,550
>> Okay. So, we we added that at the we
tried we tried that as an idea at the as

3046
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:18,560
tried we tried that as an idea at the as
 

3047
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,070
tried we tried that as an idea at the as
our first idea. Um and the problem there

3048
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,080
our first idea. Um and the problem there
 

3049
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,830
our first idea. Um and the problem there
is that everyone is now helping to

3050
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:23,840
is that everyone is now helping to
 

3051
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,590
is that everyone is now helping to
contribute to the output, but they're

3052
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:25,600
contribute to the output, but they're
 

3053
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,310
contribute to the output, but they're
not helping the later layers in any way

3054
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:28,320
not helping the later layers in any way
 

3055
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,470
not helping the later layers in any way
using a super highway. So the gradient

3056
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:30,480
using a super highway. So the gradient
 

3057
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,669
using a super highway. So the gradient
if there was only uh there only this

3058
01:15:33,669 --> 01:15:33,679
if there was only uh there only this
 

3059
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,510
if there was only uh there only this
connections and the gradient's going

3060
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
connections and the gradient's going
 

3061
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,390
connections and the gradient's going
this way to everybody

3062
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:38,400
this way to everybody
 

3063
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,110
this way to everybody
but what would help this layer that

3064
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:41,120
but what would help this layer that
 

3065
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,030
but what would help this layer that
wouldn't have a path to go to everybody

3066
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:43,040
wouldn't have a path to go to everybody
 

3067
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,590
wouldn't have a path to go to everybody
except through this backward long chain.

3068
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:45,600
except through this backward long chain.
 

3069
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,709
except through this backward long chain.
So that's what we thought about adding

3070
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:46,719
So that's what we thought about adding
 

3071
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,630
So that's what we thought about adding
paths from everything to the everything

3072
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:48,640
paths from everything to the everything
 

3073
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,630
paths from everything to the everything
else. That's too many paths. This is

3074
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:50,640
else. That's too many paths. This is
 

3075
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,990
else. That's too many paths. This is
kind of in between. So the gradient here

3076
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:54,000
kind of in between. So the gradient here
 

3077
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,110
kind of in between. So the gradient here
goes back to everybody, but the gradient

3078
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:57,120
goes back to everybody, but the gradient
 

3079
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,350
goes back to everybody, but the gradient
from that's coming through here is also

3080
01:15:59,350 --> 01:15:59,360
from that's coming through here is also
 

3081
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,910
from that's coming through here is also
then going back to everybody.

3082
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:01,920
then going back to everybody.
 

3083
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,669
then going back to everybody.
So everyone gets to help everyone in the

3084
01:16:03,669 --> 01:16:03,679
So everyone gets to help everyone in the
 

3085
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,110
So everyone gets to help everyone in the
future.

3086
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:05,120
future.
 

3087
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,189
future.
>> Okay. So we'll talk more about this next

3088
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
>> Okay. So we'll talk more about this next
 

3089
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,590
>> Okay. So we'll talk more about this next
time. I'm going to end here. Sorry I

3090
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:09,600
time. I'm going to end here. Sorry I
 

3091
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,030
time. I'm going to end here. Sorry I
can't have office hours uh today. Uh

3092
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,040
can't have office hours uh today. Uh
 

3093
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,350
can't have office hours uh today. Uh
we'll try to maybe make them up uh next

3094
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,360
we'll try to maybe make them up uh next
 

3095
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:19,880
we'll try to maybe make them up uh next
week. Okay. Bye.
