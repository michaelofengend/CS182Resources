1
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,070

Okay.

2
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080

 

3
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,629

>> Okay. Let's start.

4
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
>> Okay. Let's start.
 

5
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,390
>> Okay. Let's start.
So,

6
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
So,
 

7
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,310
So,
we we're going to change gears now. uh

8
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
we we're going to change gears now. uh
 

9
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,790
we we're going to change gears now. uh
the optimization now you know a lot of

10
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
the optimization now you know a lot of
 

11
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,150
the optimization now you know a lot of
the core uh optimization ideas modern

12
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
the core uh optimization ideas modern
 

13
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,790
the core uh optimization ideas modern
perspectives um I wanted to acknowledge

14
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
perspectives um I wanted to acknowledge
 

15
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,390
perspectives um I wanted to acknowledge
one thing which is I think we we

16
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
one thing which is I think we we
 

17
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,310
one thing which is I think we we
mentioned this in the post now you

18
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
mentioned this in the post now you
 

19
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,150
mentioned this in the post now you
understand a bit about what we were

20
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
understand a bit about what we were
 

21
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,550
understand a bit about what we were
saying in the first lecture that we're

22
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
saying in the first lecture that we're
 

23
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,550
saying in the first lecture that we're
going to be introducing material to you

24
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
going to be introducing material to you
 

25
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,670
going to be introducing material to you
that's pretty uh up to date um as a

26
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
that's pretty uh up to date um as a
 

27
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,790
that's pretty uh up to date um as a
result of this as we mentioned many of

28
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
result of this as we mentioned many of
 

29
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,950
result of this as we mentioned many of
the homework problems we have from now

30
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
the homework problems we have from now
 

31
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,590
the homework problems we have from now
onward that have coding components

32
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
onward that have coding components
 

33
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,029
onward that have coding components
don't necessarily acknowledge either the

34
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
don't necessarily acknowledge either the
 

35
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,830
don't necessarily acknowledge either the
MUP perspective or the muon perspective

36
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
MUP perspective or the muon perspective
 

37
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,029
MUP perspective or the muon perspective
on how to do optimization. Um it's too

38
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
on how to do optimization. Um it's too
 

39
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,350
on how to do optimization. Um it's too
much for us in our limited staff to

40
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
much for us in our limited staff to
 

41
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,710
much for us in our limited staff to
actually update everything. So that's

42
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
actually update everything. So that's
 

43
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,510
actually update everything. So that's
why that we have that other

44
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
why that we have that other
 

45
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,350
why that we have that other
participation option for you to you know

46
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
participation option for you to you know
 

47
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,350
participation option for you to you know
take it on yourself to say okay how

48
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
take it on yourself to say okay how
 

49
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,469
take it on yourself to say okay how
would you add a muup or a muon engaging

50
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
would you add a muup or a muon engaging
 

51
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,710
would you add a muup or a muon engaging
part to this uh coding problem and

52
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
part to this uh coding problem and
 

53
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,749
part to this uh coding problem and
that's one of the reasons we're doing

54
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
that's one of the reasons we're doing
 

55
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,950
that's one of the reasons we're doing
that so you can share with your

56
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
that so you can share with your
 

57
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,189
that so you can share with your
classmates hopefully after the last

58
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
classmates hopefully after the last
 

59
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,790
classmates hopefully after the last
couple of lectures this that makes more

60
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
couple of lectures this that makes more
 

61
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,150
couple of lectures this that makes more
sense to you than it probably did at the

62
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
sense to you than it probably did at the
 

63
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,310
sense to you than it probably did at the
beginning of the uh of the class that

64
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
beginning of the uh of the class that
 

65
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,350
beginning of the uh of the class that
we're going to have this partic

66
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
we're going to have this partic
 

67
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,230
we're going to have this partic
particular way of participation. Um

68
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
particular way of participation. Um
 

69
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,070
particular way of participation. Um
before we move into the topic I wanted

70
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
before we move into the topic I wanted
 

71
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,270
before we move into the topic I wanted
to also acknowledge uh the you know the

72
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
to also acknowledge uh the you know the
 

73
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,189
to also acknowledge uh the you know the
text we recommend and we often like

74
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
text we recommend and we often like
 

75
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,270
text we recommend and we often like
we'll show figures from it which is

76
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
we'll show figures from it which is
 

77
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,629
we'll show figures from it which is
Prince's understanding deep learning

78
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
Prince's understanding deep learning
 

79
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,550
Prince's understanding deep learning
book. So in case we haven't been

80
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
book. So in case we haven't been
 

81
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,390
book. So in case we haven't been
mentioning it but in case you want to

82
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
mentioning it but in case you want to
 

83
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,950
mentioning it but in case you want to
know what you should have read up to um

84
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
know what you should have read up to um
 

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,230
know what you should have read up to um
it's basically you should have read up

86
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
it's basically you should have read up
 

87
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,870
it's basically you should have read up
through chapter nine uh of that textbook

88
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
through chapter nine uh of that textbook
 

89
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,469
through chapter nine uh of that textbook
in terms of what we've covered uh so

90
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
in terms of what we've covered uh so
 

91
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,909
in terms of what we've covered uh so
far. Of course it doesn't have coverage

92
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
far. Of course it doesn't have coverage
 

93
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,469
far. Of course it doesn't have coverage
of uh mup and muadan and all of that

94
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
of uh mup and muadan and all of that
 

95
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,230
of uh mup and muadan and all of that
that perspective is not in the textbooks

96
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
that perspective is not in the textbooks
 

97
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,230
that perspective is not in the textbooks
yet. uh we're going to be engaging with

98
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
yet. uh we're going to be engaging with
 

99
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,189
yet. uh we're going to be engaging with
connets uh now and that's chapters uh 10

100
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
connets uh now and that's chapters uh 10
 

101
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,749
connets uh now and that's chapters uh 10
and 11. Now for the connet engagement

102
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
and 11. Now for the connet engagement
 

103
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,469
and 11. Now for the connet engagement
this is more stable uh material uh

104
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
this is more stable uh material uh
 

105
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,990
this is more stable uh material uh
that's well understood. So the textbook

106
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
that's well understood. So the textbook
 

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,309
that's well understood. So the textbook
is is is quite good in terms of engaging

108
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:24,319
is is is quite good in terms of engaging
 

109
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,309
is is is quite good in terms of engaging
with it. There'll be some added details

110
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
with it. There'll be some added details
 

111
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,790
with it. There'll be some added details
we'll talk about in class but mostly the

112
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
we'll talk about in class but mostly the
 

113
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,110
we'll talk about in class but mostly the
textbook is quite good.

114
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
textbook is quite good.
 

115
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,430
textbook is quite good.
Okay. So uh now many of you when you

116
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
Okay. So uh now many of you when you
 

117
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,029
Okay. So uh now many of you when you
walked into a deep learning class maybe

118
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
walked into a deep learning class maybe
 

119
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,469
walked into a deep learning class maybe
were expecting to learn about lots of

120
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
were expecting to learn about lots of
 

121
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,670
were expecting to learn about lots of
different deep learning architectures

122
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
different deep learning architectures
 

123
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,670
different deep learning architectures
and we did say we were going to do that

124
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
and we did say we were going to do that
 

125
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,270
and we did say we were going to do that
but we wanted to make sure you had the

126
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
but we wanted to make sure you had the
 

127
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,110
but we wanted to make sure you had the
foundations first of being able to

128
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
foundations first of being able to
 

129
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,469
foundations first of being able to
actually engage with what's going on in

130
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
actually engage with what's going on in
 

131
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,990
actually engage with what's going on in
the optimizations and so on so you can

132
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
the optimizations and so on so you can
 

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,350
the optimizations and so on so you can
appreciate a little bit more what's

134
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
appreciate a little bit more what's
 

135
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,350
appreciate a little bit more what's
happening with the architectures.

136
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
happening with the architectures.
 

137
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,990
happening with the architectures.
Uh so the architecture order we're going

138
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
Uh so the architecture order we're going
 

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,550
Uh so the architecture order we're going
to be taking in this class is you've

140
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
to be taking in this class is you've
 

141
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,870
to be taking in this class is you've
already seen multi-layer perceptrons you

142
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
already seen multi-layer perceptrons you
 

143
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,309
already seen multi-layer perceptrons you
know fully connected things that things

144
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
know fully connected things that things
 

145
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,710
know fully connected things that things
we've been talking about uh in class as

146
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
we've been talking about uh in class as
 

147
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,749
we've been talking about uh in class as
well as in in a previous class

148
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
well as in in a previous class
 

149
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,270
well as in in a previous class
now we're going to talk about CNN's

150
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
now we're going to talk about CNN's
 

151
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,390
now we're going to talk about CNN's
convolutional neural nets now and CNN's

152
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
convolutional neural nets now and CNN's
 

153
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,110
convolutional neural nets now and CNN's
are uh going to be used to both

154
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
are uh going to be used to both
 

155
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,029
are uh going to be used to both
introduce CNN's but also to talk about

156
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
introduce CNN's but also to talk about
 

157
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,550
introduce CNN's but also to talk about
many of the architectural building

158
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
many of the architectural building
 

159
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,830
many of the architectural building
blocks which will be important kind of

160
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
blocks which will be important kind of
 

161
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,189
blocks which will be important kind of
throughout uh all the other

162
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
throughout uh all the other
 

163
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,110
throughout uh all the other
architectures we'll talk about But in

164
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
architectures we'll talk about But in
 

165
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,830
architectures we'll talk about But in
case you want to know where we're going

166
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
case you want to know where we're going
 

167
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,430
case you want to know where we're going
to be going, I mean, I think it's on the

168
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
to be going, I mean, I think it's on the
 

169
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,430
to be going, I mean, I think it's on the
on the website, but you know, we're

170
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
on the website, but you know, we're
 

171
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,029
on the website, but you know, we're
going to go from CNN's to graph neural

172
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
going to go from CNN's to graph neural
 

173
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,510
going to go from CNN's to graph neural
nets and from there to uh RNN's

174
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
nets and from there to uh RNN's
 

175
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,469
nets and from there to uh RNN's
and we'll include a treatment of uh

176
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
and we'll include a treatment of uh
 

177
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,189
and we'll include a treatment of uh
state space models, which again at the

178
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
state space models, which again at the
 

179
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,990
state space models, which again at the
graph neural net and is partially

180
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
graph neural net and is partially
 

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,909
graph neural net and is partially
present I think in Prince's book. The

182
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
present I think in Prince's book. The
 

183
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,150
present I think in Prince's book. The
RNN's are not and state space models are

184
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
RNN's are not and state space models are
 

185
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,749
RNN's are not and state space models are
certainly not. Those are again something

186
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
certainly not. Those are again something
 

187
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,990
certainly not. Those are again something
that's more recent in their development.

188
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
that's more recent in their development.
 

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,150
that's more recent in their development.
But in case again for a preview of

190
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
But in case again for a preview of
 

191
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,749
But in case again for a preview of
things in case people are following

192
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
things in case people are following
 

193
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,029
things in case people are following
what's going on with current

194
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
what's going on with current
 

195
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,270
what's going on with current
developments the state space ideas are

196
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
developments the state space ideas are
 

197
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,189
developments the state space ideas are
now becoming integrated in some of the

198
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
now becoming integrated in some of the
 

199
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,950
now becoming integrated in some of the
uh leading edge models. I believe one of

200
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
uh leading edge models. I believe one of
 

201
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,189
uh leading edge models. I believe one of
the latest Quen models has a a hybrid

202
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
the latest Quen models has a a hybrid
 

203
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,950
the latest Quen models has a a hybrid
between transformers and state space

204
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
between transformers and state space
 

205
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,270
between transformers and state space
models as part of its structure. So

206
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
models as part of its structure. So
 

207
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,110
models as part of its structure. So
after we talk about uh state space

208
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
after we talk about uh state space
 

209
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,790
after we talk about uh state space
modeling we'll move into talking about

210
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
modeling we'll move into talking about
 

211
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,070
modeling we'll move into talking about
transformers. That's the kind of order

212
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080
transformers. That's the kind of order
 

213
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,189
transformers. That's the kind of order
of architectures we're going to be

214
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
of architectures we're going to be
 

215
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,309
of architectures we're going to be
talking about uh in this class.

216
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
talking about uh in this class.
 

217
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,869
talking about uh in this class.
Okay. So it's good to you know sort of

218
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
Okay. So it's good to you know sort of
 

219
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,629
Okay. So it's good to you know sort of
keep in mind very high level you know

220
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
keep in mind very high level you know
 

221
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,110
keep in mind very high level you know
what is the difference you know between

222
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
what is the difference you know between
 

223
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,350
what is the difference you know between
uh multi-layer perceptrons and CNN. So

224
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
uh multi-layer perceptrons and CNN. So
 

225
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,510
uh multi-layer perceptrons and CNN. So
before I maybe talk about this figure a

226
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
before I maybe talk about this figure a
 

227
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,270
before I maybe talk about this figure a
little bit I I did want to just ask a

228
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
little bit I I did want to just ask a
 

229
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,389
little bit I I did want to just ask a
question. Uh how many people raise your

230
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
question. Uh how many people raise your
 

231
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,589
question. Uh how many people raise your
hands if you have seen a convolutional

232
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
hands if you have seen a convolutional
 

233
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,670
hands if you have seen a convolutional
neural net before in a class?

234
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
neural net before in a class?
 

235
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,350
neural net before in a class?
Okay, so a lot of people have uh of the

236
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
Okay, so a lot of people have uh of the
 

237
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,670
Okay, so a lot of people have uh of the
people who did not raise their hands,

238
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
people who did not raise their hands,
 

239
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,590
people who did not raise their hands,
how many people have seen a

240
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
how many people have seen a
 

241
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,030
how many people have seen a
convolutional neural net in the sense of

242
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
convolutional neural net in the sense of
 

243
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,389
convolutional neural net in the sense of
having worked with it like you played

244
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
having worked with it like you played
 

245
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,829
having worked with it like you played
with it in some way uh in research or

246
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
with it in some way uh in research or
 

247
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,310
with it in some way uh in research or
some other some other way work or

248
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
some other some other way work or
 

249
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,630
some other some other way work or
something like that. Okay. So between

250
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
something like that. Okay. So between
 

251
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,030
something like that. Okay. So between
those two, it's almost everybody uh in

252
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
those two, it's almost everybody uh in
 

253
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,070
those two, it's almost everybody uh in
the in the class. So,

254
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
the in the class. So,
 

255
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,070
the in the class. So,
uh, I hope for those of you who've seen

256
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
uh, I hope for those of you who've seen
 

257
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,630
uh, I hope for those of you who've seen
this stuff before, you will still get a

258
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
this stuff before, you will still get a
 

259
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,910
this stuff before, you will still get a
bunch out of the lectures. Uh, but we

260
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
bunch out of the lectures. Uh, but we
 

261
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,190
bunch out of the lectures. Uh, but we
have to make sure everyone's on the same

262
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
have to make sure everyone's on the same
 

263
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,590
have to make sure everyone's on the same
page. So, some of it might be a little

264
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
page. So, some of it might be a little
 

265
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,310
page. So, some of it might be a little
bit of review, but try to, you know, use

266
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
bit of review, but try to, you know, use
 

267
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,829
bit of review, but try to, you know, use
the fact that you know something to ask

268
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
the fact that you know something to ask
 

269
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,790
the fact that you know something to ask
good questions. Okay.

270
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
good questions. Okay.
 

271
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,990
good questions. Okay.
So uh if you think about a multi-layer

272
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
So uh if you think about a multi-layer
 

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,670
So uh if you think about a multi-layer
perceptron the kind of what's happening

274
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
perceptron the kind of what's happening
 

275
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,310
perceptron the kind of what's happening
in a layer one hidden layer let's say is

276
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
in a layer one hidden layer let's say is
 

277
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,829
in a layer one hidden layer let's say is
you have you know for example the inputs

278
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
you have you know for example the inputs
 

279
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,910
you have you know for example the inputs
the layer you have the outputs and you

280
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
the layer you have the outputs and you
 

281
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,230
the layer you have the outputs and you
have a fully connected graph between

282
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
have a fully connected graph between
 

283
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,630
have a fully connected graph between
them of weights and you have a giant

284
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
them of weights and you have a giant
 

285
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,710
them of weights and you have a giant
weight matrix that looks like this. It's

286
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
weight matrix that looks like this. It's
 

287
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,470
weight matrix that looks like this. It's
like illustrated by colors you know

288
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
like illustrated by colors you know
 

289
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,590
like illustrated by colors you know
darker colors are uh larger weights and

290
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
darker colors are uh larger weights and
 

291
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,310
darker colors are uh larger weights and
lighter colors are are smaller weights

292
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
lighter colors are are smaller weights
 

293
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,030
lighter colors are are smaller weights
and white is zero. Okay. And what a

294
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
and white is zero. Okay. And what a
 

295
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,269
and white is zero. Okay. And what a
convolutional neural net is at some

296
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
convolutional neural net is at some
 

297
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,110
convolutional neural net is at some
level is it says we're going to

298
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
level is it says we're going to
 

299
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,630
level is it says we're going to
specialize that weight matrix. So it's

300
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
specialize that weight matrix. So it's
 

301
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,630
specialize that weight matrix. So it's
not a generic matrix that you can fill

302
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
not a generic matrix that you can fill
 

303
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,870
not a generic matrix that you can fill
with anything you want, but it respects

304
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
with anything you want, but it respects
 

305
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,790
with anything you want, but it respects
a very nice graph. So it's the

306
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
a very nice graph. So it's the
 

307
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,069
a very nice graph. So it's the
interactions are only local. So h1 only

308
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
interactions are only local. So h1 only
 

309
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,670
interactions are only local. So h1 only
depends in this case on uh x x1 and x2.

310
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
depends in this case on uh x x1 and x2.
 

311
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,310
depends in this case on uh x x1 and x2.
H2 depends on X1, X2, X3 and so on to

312
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
H2 depends on X1, X2, X3 and so on to
 

313
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,389
H2 depends on X1, X2, X3 and so on to
three three neighboring things.

314
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
three three neighboring things.
 

315
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,389
three three neighboring things.
So that gives you a structure if you

316
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
So that gives you a structure if you
 

317
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,590
So that gives you a structure if you
want to think about it to the weight

318
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
want to think about it to the weight
 

319
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,550
want to think about it to the weight
matrix that looks like this that there's

320
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
matrix that looks like this that there's
 

321
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,310
matrix that looks like this that there's
a whole bunch a sparse structure there's

322
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
a whole bunch a sparse structure there's
 

323
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,230
a whole bunch a sparse structure there's
a whole bunch of zeros where there's no

324
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
a whole bunch of zeros where there's no
 

325
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,230
a whole bunch of zeros where there's no
edge in the graph. Okay, everyone get

326
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
edge in the graph. Okay, everyone get
 

327
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,910
edge in the graph. Okay, everyone get
that part?

328
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
that part?
 

329
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,949
that part?
And furthermore, there's one more thing

330
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:42,959
And furthermore, there's one more thing
 

331
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,870
And furthermore, there's one more thing
that happens in the CNN's that we work

332
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
that happens in the CNN's that we work
 

333
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,670
that happens in the CNN's that we work
with is

334
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
with is
 

335
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,430
with is
Some of the entries of the matrix are

336
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
Some of the entries of the matrix are
 

337
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,670
Some of the entries of the matrix are
the same. So in this particular case,

338
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
the same. So in this particular case,
 

339
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,590
the same. So in this particular case,
all the diagonals are the same. All the

340
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
all the diagonals are the same. All the
 

341
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,190
all the diagonals are the same. All the
one-off diagonals are the same. All the

342
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
one-off diagonals are the same. All the
 

343
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,550
one-off diagonals are the same. All the
one-off diagonals in the other one side

344
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
one-off diagonals in the other one side
 

345
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,230
one-off diagonals in the other one side
are also the same. They must have the

346
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
are also the same. They must have the
 

347
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,190
are also the same. They must have the
same weights in them.

348
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
same weights in them.
 

349
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,910
same weights in them.
So the number of distinct weights in the

350
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
So the number of distinct weights in the
 

351
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,230
So the number of distinct weights in the
distinct real number parameters in this

352
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
distinct real number parameters in this
 

353
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,350
distinct real number parameters in this
is much much smaller than this. So

354
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:09,360
is much much smaller than this. So
 

355
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,190
is much much smaller than this. So
that's another aspect of CNN if you want

356
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
that's another aspect of CNN if you want
 

357
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,550
that's another aspect of CNN if you want
to think about it at a high very high

358
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
to think about it at a high very high
 

359
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,710
to think about it at a high very high
level.

360
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
level.
 

361
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,710
level.
But

362
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
But
 

363
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,630
But
you know let's let's try to understand

364
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
you know let's let's try to understand
 

365
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,509
you know let's let's try to understand
this more

366
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
this more
 

367
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,590
this more
so CNN's to understand CNN's is to

368
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
so CNN's to understand CNN's is to
 

369
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,110
so CNN's to understand CNN's is to
understand both architectural principles

370
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
understand both architectural principles
 

371
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,430
understand both architectural principles
for neural nets but also ways of

372
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
for neural nets but also ways of
 

373
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,910
for neural nets but also ways of
thinking that get gives rise to

374
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
thinking that get gives rise to
 

375
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,750
thinking that get gives rise to
architectures and the historical

376
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
architectures and the historical
 

377
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,990
architectures and the historical
perspective CNN's can be helpful in

378
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
perspective CNN's can be helpful in
 

379
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,550
perspective CNN's can be helpful in
understanding uh how how that happens

380
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
understanding uh how how that happens
 

381
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,870
understanding uh how how that happens
how people thought about something asked

382
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
how people thought about something asked
 

383
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,870
how people thought about something asked
how can I use a neural net to do this

384
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
how can I use a neural net to do this
 

385
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,710
how can I use a neural net to do this
and came up with architectures

386
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720

 

387
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,430

So CNN's definitely grew out of one

388
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
So CNN's definitely grew out of one
 

389
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,670
So CNN's definitely grew out of one
particular uh domain which is computer

390
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
particular uh domain which is computer
 

391
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,710
particular uh domain which is computer
vision uh computer vision problems and

392
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
vision uh computer vision problems and
 

393
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,790
vision uh computer vision problems and
computer vision problems are problems in

394
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
computer vision problems are problems in
 

395
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,030
computer vision problems are problems in
which you have images or video and you

396
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
which you have images or video and you
 

397
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,949
which you have images or video and you
want to do something with them. Okay,

398
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:04,959
want to do something with them. Okay,
 

399
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,590
want to do something with them. Okay,
that's computer vision.

400
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
that's computer vision.
 

401
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,910
that's computer vision.
So the classic computer vision problem

402
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
So the classic computer vision problem
 

403
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,350
So the classic computer vision problem
that we're going to also kind of focus

404
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
that we're going to also kind of focus
 

405
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,150
that we're going to also kind of focus
in on when we uh talk about CNN's in

406
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
in on when we uh talk about CNN's in
 

407
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,790
in on when we uh talk about CNN's in
terms of motivation is you know

408
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
terms of motivation is you know
 

409
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,790
terms of motivation is you know
classification.

410
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
classification.
 

411
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,629
classification.
So you're given a picture and you have

412
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:20,639
So you're given a picture and you have
 

413
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,509
So you're given a picture and you have
to tell whether it's the digit zero the

414
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
to tell whether it's the digit zero the
 

415
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,550
to tell whether it's the digit zero the
digit one the digit two the digit three

416
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
digit one the digit two the digit three
 

417
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,269
digit one the digit two the digit three
four five six seven eight or nine. Okay,

418
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
four five six seven eight or nine. Okay,
 

419
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,870
four five six seven eight or nine. Okay,
that's like for example, if you ever

420
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
that's like for example, if you ever
 

421
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,629
that's like for example, if you ever
used saw the emnest data set which we

422
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
used saw the emnest data set which we
 

423
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,829
used saw the emnest data set which we
have uh had you play with a little bit.

424
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
have uh had you play with a little bit.
 

425
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,509
have uh had you play with a little bit.
Uh you know that's what that data set

426
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
Uh you know that's what that data set
 

427
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,430
Uh you know that's what that data set
is. So that's a kind example of vision

428
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
is. So that's a kind example of vision
 

429
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,350
is. So that's a kind example of vision
problem. You have a picture in the case

430
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
problem. You have a picture in the case
 

431
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,629
problem. You have a picture in the case
of emnest a grayscale picture and you

432
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
of emnest a grayscale picture and you
 

433
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,150
of emnest a grayscale picture and you
have to give a class classification for

434
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
have to give a class classification for
 

435
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,230
have to give a class classification for
it. CR10 is another uh data set that

436
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
it. CR10 is another uh data set that
 

437
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,829
it. CR10 is another uh data set that
we've had you play with and that's a

438
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
we've had you play with and that's a
 

439
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,509
we've had you play with and that's a
data set in which you have again a small

440
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:57,519
data set in which you have again a small
 

441
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,670
data set in which you have again a small
image uh and it's in one of 10 classes.

442
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
image uh and it's in one of 10 classes.
 

443
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,790
image uh and it's in one of 10 classes.
Okay, that's the classification problem.

444
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
Okay, that's the classification problem.
 

445
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,949
Okay, that's the classification problem.
Uh

446
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
Uh
 

447
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,190
Uh
there's more kinds of problems in

448
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
there's more kinds of problems in
 

449
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,310
there's more kinds of problems in
computer vision than just

450
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
computer vision than just
 

451
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,389
computer vision than just
classification. And the other one we're

452
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
classification. And the other one we're
 

453
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,870
classification. And the other one we're
going to be using later to kind of talk

454
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:14,880
going to be using later to kind of talk
 

455
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,470
going to be using later to kind of talk
about architectural principles that we

456
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
about architectural principles that we
 

457
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,230
about architectural principles that we
don't we can't get at just using

458
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
don't we can't get at just using
 

459
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,030
don't we can't get at just using
classification is the problem of

460
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
classification is the problem of
 

461
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,710
classification is the problem of
semantic segmentation. So this is a

462
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
semantic segmentation. So this is a
 

463
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,949
semantic segmentation. So this is a
picture out of prints

464
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
picture out of prints
 

465
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,509
picture out of prints
uh for semantic segmentation where you

466
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
uh for semantic segmentation where you
 

467
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,269
uh for semantic segmentation where you
can see here hopefully everyone can see

468
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
can see here hopefully everyone can see
 

469
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,710
can see here hopefully everyone can see
I'll zoom in right you can see a scene

470
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
I'll zoom in right you can see a scene
 

471
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,110
I'll zoom in right you can see a scene
and the scene has been with given

472
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
and the scene has been with given
 

473
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,870
and the scene has been with given
stylized colors. So the fact that

474
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
stylized colors. So the fact that
 

475
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,069
stylized colors. So the fact that
there's a a blue couch doesn't mean that

476
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
there's a a blue couch doesn't mean that
 

477
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,590
there's a a blue couch doesn't mean that
in this scene the couch is supposed to

478
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
in this scene the couch is supposed to
 

479
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,629
in this scene the couch is supposed to
be blue. It's just that the everything

480
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
be blue. It's just that the everything
 

481
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,310
be blue. It's just that the everything
that is couch has been colored blue and

482
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
that is couch has been colored blue and
 

483
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,629
that is couch has been colored blue and
everything that is table is this

484
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
everything that is table is this
 

485
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,110
everything that is table is this
particular shade of green. And so

486
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
particular shade of green. And so
 

487
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,350
particular shade of green. And so
different kinds of things are have

488
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
different kinds of things are have
 

489
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,870
different kinds of things are have
different colors as a way of

490
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
different colors as a way of
 

491
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,470
different colors as a way of
representing what the computer vision

492
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
representing what the computer vision
 

493
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,230
representing what the computer vision
task here is which is to label not the

494
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
task here is which is to label not the
 

495
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,110
task here is which is to label not the
entire image but to label every pixel of

496
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
entire image but to label every pixel of
 

497
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,150
entire image but to label every pixel of
the image to say what kind of thing is

498
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
the image to say what kind of thing is
 

499
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,629
the image to say what kind of thing is
this pixel a part of. Does everyone see

500
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:10,639
this pixel a part of. Does everyone see
 

501
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,870
this pixel a part of. Does everyone see
how that's another interesting uh

502
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
how that's another interesting uh
 

503
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,350
how that's another interesting uh
computer vision problem?

504
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
computer vision problem?
 

505
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,310
computer vision problem?
So we'll use this later to talk about

506
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
So we'll use this later to talk about
 

507
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,670
So we'll use this later to talk about
architectural principles we don't get

508
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
architectural principles we don't get
 

509
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,870
architectural principles we don't get
from just uh thinking about

510
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
from just uh thinking about
 

511
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,670
from just uh thinking about
classification problems. But computer

512
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
classification problems. But computer
 

513
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,430
classification problems. But computer
vision is a broad area. There's an

514
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
vision is a broad area. There's an
 

515
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,990
vision is a broad area. There's an
entire class on computer vision that

516
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
entire class on computer vision that
 

517
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,509
entire class on computer vision that
many of you are taking which has an

518
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
many of you are taking which has an
 

519
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,790
many of you are taking which has an
unfortunate time conflict with our

520
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
unfortunate time conflict with our
 

521
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,069
unfortunate time conflict with our
office hours. We know this. Um and you

522
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
office hours. We know this. Um and you
 

523
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,069
office hours. We know this. Um and you
know so this is not a computer vision

524
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
know so this is not a computer vision
 

525
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,430
know so this is not a computer vision
class. However, you will have to learn

526
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
class. However, you will have to learn
 

527
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,110
class. However, you will have to learn
some computer vision kind of along the

528
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
some computer vision kind of along the
 

529
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,990
some computer vision kind of along the
way.

530
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
way.
 

531
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,350
way.
So here it's important for a little side

532
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:43,360
So here it's important for a little side
 

533
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,590
So here it's important for a little side
digression is useful

534
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
digression is useful
 

535
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,230
digression is useful
which is there's a few problems in the

536
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
which is there's a few problems in the
 

537
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,790
which is there's a few problems in the
world that or families of problems that

538
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
world that or families of problems that
 

539
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,350
world that or families of problems that
tend to drive at least currently a lot

540
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
tend to drive at least currently a lot
 

541
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,150
tend to drive at least currently a lot
of progress in the deep neural nets

542
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
of progress in the deep neural nets
 

543
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,110
of progress in the deep neural nets
area. Computer vision is one of them.

544
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,120
area. Computer vision is one of them.
 

545
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,069
area. Computer vision is one of them.
Another is natural language processing

546
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
Another is natural language processing
 

547
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,990
Another is natural language processing
and to those are the two big ones and to

548
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000
and to those are the two big ones and to
 

549
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,990
and to those are the two big ones and to
a lesser extent you have a lot of

550
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
a lesser extent you have a lot of
 

551
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,189
a lesser extent you have a lot of
progress uh being driven uh through

552
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
progress uh being driven uh through
 

553
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,670
progress uh being driven uh through
thinking about control and robotics but

554
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
thinking about control and robotics but
 

555
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,389
thinking about control and robotics but
this distant third uh to these two uh

556
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
this distant third uh to these two uh
 

557
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,310
this distant third uh to these two uh
big ones. So as a result if you want so

558
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
big ones. So as a result if you want so
 

559
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,750
big ones. So as a result if you want so
suppose you yourself say I don't care

560
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
suppose you yourself say I don't care
 

561
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,430
suppose you yourself say I don't care
about any of those completely reasonable

562
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
about any of those completely reasonable
 

563
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,670
about any of those completely reasonable
to not care about any of those however

564
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
to not care about any of those however
 

565
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,189
to not care about any of those however
you still have to know a little bit

566
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
you still have to know a little bit
 

567
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,910
you still have to know a little bit
about them. Why? Because many new

568
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
about them. Why? Because many new
 

569
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,310
about them. Why? Because many new
advances will come out in papers that

570
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
advances will come out in papers that
 

571
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,990
advances will come out in papers that
are rooted in one of those uh domains

572
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
are rooted in one of those uh domains
 

573
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,590
are rooted in one of those uh domains
and you have to be able to understand

574
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,600
and you have to be able to understand
 

575
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,829
and you have to be able to understand
enough about the domain to be able to

576
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
enough about the domain to be able to
 

577
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,350
enough about the domain to be able to
get at the idea you want. So suppose

578
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
get at the idea you want. So suppose
 

579
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,710
get at the idea you want. So suppose
you're interested in know certain kinds

580
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
you're interested in know certain kinds
 

581
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,110
you're interested in know certain kinds
of you know problems about molecules.

582
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
of you know problems about molecules.
 

583
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,350
of you know problems about molecules.
Great. You have to be able to read read

584
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
Great. You have to be able to read read
 

585
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,910
Great. You have to be able to read read
a paper uh about natural language

586
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
a paper uh about natural language
 

587
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,590
a paper uh about natural language
processing enough to see okay here's the

588
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
processing enough to see okay here's the
 

589
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,189
processing enough to see okay here's the
technique. Can you adapt this to your

590
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
technique. Can you adapt this to your
 

591
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,949
technique. Can you adapt this to your
molecular problem? Okay. So that is the

592
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
molecular problem? Okay. So that is the
 

593
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,350
molecular problem? Okay. So that is the
limit of our goal in telling in teaching

594
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
limit of our goal in telling in teaching
 

595
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,269
limit of our goal in telling in teaching
you anything about vision or about

596
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279
you anything about vision or about
 

597
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,790
you anything about vision or about
natural language processing is to

598
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
natural language processing is to
 

599
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,030
natural language processing is to
hopefully get you enough so that you can

600
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
hopefully get you enough so that you can
 

601
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,069
hopefully get you enough so that you can
then read a paper with the assistance of

602
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
then read a paper with the assistance of
 

603
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,389
then read a paper with the assistance of
chat GPT or something else to get the

604
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
chat GPT or something else to get the
 

605
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,230
chat GPT or something else to get the
rest of the context to be able to digest

606
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
rest of the context to be able to digest
 

607
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,749
rest of the context to be able to digest
what you need to get. Okay, that's

608
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
what you need to get. Okay, that's
 

609
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,350
what you need to get. Okay, that's
that's our goal. This is not a vision

610
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
that's our goal. This is not a vision
 

611
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,310
that's our goal. This is not a vision
class. It's not an NLP class.

612
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
class. It's not an NLP class.
 

613
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,910
class. It's not an NLP class.
There are other classes that are fully

614
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
There are other classes that are fully
 

615
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,710
There are other classes that are fully
dedicated to those topics. Okay. So now

616
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
dedicated to those topics. Okay. So now
 

617
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,949
dedicated to those topics. Okay. So now
the other key thing I want to talk about

618
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
the other key thing I want to talk about
 

619
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,870
the other key thing I want to talk about
uh that drove the development of CNN's

620
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
uh that drove the development of CNN's
 

621
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,829
uh that drove the development of CNN's
is the nature of the inputs we have. So

622
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
is the nature of the inputs we have. So
 

623
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,110
is the nature of the inputs we have. So
we have images. So what's an image? So a

624
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
we have images. So what's an image? So a
 

625
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,629
we have images. So what's an image? So a
grayscale image is a grid of pixels

626
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
grayscale image is a grid of pixels
 

627
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,430
grayscale image is a grid of pixels
filled with you know particular values

628
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
filled with you know particular values
 

629
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,389
filled with you know particular values
for the pixel how bright or dark it is.

630
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
for the pixel how bright or dark it is.
 

631
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,910
for the pixel how bright or dark it is.
A color image looks like this. It has a

632
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
A color image looks like this. It has a
 

633
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,430
A color image looks like this. It has a
height. It has a width. And it has three

634
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
height. It has a width. And it has three
 

635
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,310
height. It has a width. And it has three
distinct channels. The red channel, the

636
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:56,320
distinct channels. The red channel, the
 

637
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,150
distinct channels. The red channel, the
green channel, and the blue channel. For

638
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
green channel, and the blue channel. For
 

639
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,629
green channel, and the blue channel. For
example, there's also other color spaces

640
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
example, there's also other color spaces
 

641
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,150
example, there's also other color spaces
which are also useful and interesting.

642
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
which are also useful and interesting.
 

643
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,990
which are also useful and interesting.
And computer vision classes will might

644
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
And computer vision classes will might
 

645
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,590
And computer vision classes will might
talk about how do you exploit those

646
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
talk about how do you exploit those
 

647
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,750
talk about how do you exploit those
appropriately.

648
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
appropriately.
 

649
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,470
appropriately.
But the kind of object it is is like

650
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
But the kind of object it is is like
 

651
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,069
But the kind of object it is is like
this.

652
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
this.
 

653
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,549
this.
It's a array

654
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
It's a array
 

655
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,990
It's a array
presented to us that has a height, a

656
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
presented to us that has a height, a
 

657
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,470
presented to us that has a height, a
width, and a number of channels.

658
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
width, and a number of channels.
 

659
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,909
width, and a number of channels.
And what we're going to do in CNN's is

660
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919
And what we're going to do in CNN's is
 

661
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,470
And what we're going to do in CNN's is
we will build neural nets that take

662
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
we will build neural nets that take
 

663
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,230
we will build neural nets that take
these kinds of things as their basic

664
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
these kinds of things as their basic
 

665
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,110
these kinds of things as their basic
objects and we'll try as much as

666
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
objects and we'll try as much as
 

667
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,870
objects and we'll try as much as
possible to stay within this kind of uh

668
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:34,880
possible to stay within this kind of uh
 

669
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,110
possible to stay within this kind of uh
domain for as long as possible before

670
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
domain for as long as possible before
 

671
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,710
domain for as long as possible before
they have to go to some other domain. So

672
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
they have to go to some other domain. So
 

673
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,710
they have to go to some other domain. So
a classification problem cannot be

674
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:40,720
a classification problem cannot be
 

675
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,430
a classification problem cannot be
expressed this way. Right? Right? If you

676
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
expressed this way. Right? Right? If you
 

677
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,950
expressed this way. Right? Right? If you
want to give an output of this is a dog,

678
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:44,960
want to give an output of this is a dog,
 

679
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,630
want to give an output of this is a dog,
this is a cat, this is a banana, this is

680
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
this is a cat, this is a banana, this is
 

681
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,430
this is a cat, this is a banana, this is
a horse, that's not naturally, you know,

682
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
a horse, that's not naturally, you know,
 

683
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,430
a horse, that's not naturally, you know,
an array, it's like a a vector of scores

684
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
an array, it's like a a vector of scores
 

685
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,110
an array, it's like a a vector of scores
associated with each class. So we'll

686
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
associated with each class. So we'll
 

687
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,990
associated with each class. So we'll
convert to that at some point, but CNN's

688
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
convert to that at some point, but CNN's
 

689
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,510
convert to that at some point, but CNN's
as long as possible stay in this kind of

690
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
as long as possible stay in this kind of
 

691
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,669
as long as possible stay in this kind of
zone. Okay, so that's a bit about CNN's.

692
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
zone. Okay, so that's a bit about CNN's.
 

693
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,029
zone. Okay, so that's a bit about CNN's.
Okay, now I want to talk about at a high

694
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
Okay, now I want to talk about at a high
 

695
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,029
Okay, now I want to talk about at a high
level certain key ideas and I'm going to

696
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
level certain key ideas and I'm going to
 

697
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,789
level certain key ideas and I'm going to
divide them into two categories. So here

698
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
divide them into two categories. So here
 

699
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,909
divide them into two categories. So here
I'm just going to

700
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:13,919
I'm just going to
 

701
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,190
I'm just going to
the first category is expressivity. I'll

702
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
the first category is expressivity. I'll
 

703
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,909
the first category is expressivity. I'll
call it expressivity which is what are

704
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
call it expressivity which is what are
 

705
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,830
call it expressivity which is what are
the kinds of things that we want to be

706
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
the kinds of things that we want to be
 

707
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,470
the kinds of things that we want to be
able to express with our CNN that we

708
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,480
able to express with our CNN that we
 

709
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,510
able to express with our CNN that we
believe are relevant for vision

710
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
believe are relevant for vision
 

711
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,549
believe are relevant for vision
problems. So the architectures every

712
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:32,559
problems. So the architectures every
 

713
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,710
problems. So the architectures every
architecture can express certain things

714
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
architecture can express certain things
 

715
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,710
architecture can express certain things
and it can express certain things easier

716
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:36,720
and it can express certain things easier
 

717
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,350
and it can express certain things easier
and other things potentially harder. So

718
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
and other things potentially harder. So
 

719
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,150
and other things potentially harder. So
the idea the thinking here is whatever

720
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
the idea the thinking here is whatever
 

721
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,710
the idea the thinking here is whatever
the kinds of

722
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720
the kinds of
 

723
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,549
the kinds of
things that are that we would like we

724
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
things that are that we would like we
 

725
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,990
things that are that we would like we
believe are relevant for understanding

726
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
believe are relevant for understanding
 

727
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,750
believe are relevant for understanding
the patterns associated with images we

728
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:49,760
the patterns associated with images we
 

729
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,750
the patterns associated with images we
would like to make those easy for this

730
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
would like to make those easy for this
 

731
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,150
would like to make those easy for this
CNN to express and therefore learn.

732
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
CNN to express and therefore learn.
 

733
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,669
CNN to express and therefore learn.
That's the thinking. So the first idea

734
00:18:59,669 --> 00:18:59,679
That's the thinking. So the first idea
 

735
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,110
That's the thinking. So the first idea
I'll use a different color.

736
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120

 

737
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,070

I don't know if that's a different

738
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
I don't know if that's a different
 

739
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,950
I don't know if that's a different
color. Um the first idea

740
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
color. Um the first idea
 

741
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:21,990
color. Um the first idea
is locality

742
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000

 

743
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,510

and the idea here is that the order of

744
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
and the idea here is that the order of
 

745
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,909
and the idea here is that the order of
the pixels matters. If you take an image

746
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:31,919
the pixels matters. If you take an image
 

747
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,110
the pixels matters. If you take an image
and you shuffle the pixels, so take all

748
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,120
and you shuffle the pixels, so take all
 

749
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,190
and you shuffle the pixels, so take all
the pixels and put them into a different

750
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
the pixels and put them into a different
 

751
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,230
the pixels and put them into a different
place. You've all played that little

752
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
place. You've all played that little
 

753
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,150
place. You've all played that little
game with puzzles, right? You take a

754
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
game with puzzles, right? You take a
 

755
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,590
game with puzzles, right? You take a
there's a picture, there's a bunch of

756
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
there's a picture, there's a bunch of
 

757
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,029
there's a picture, there's a bunch of
squares, you like move the squares

758
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
squares, you like move the squares
 

759
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,110
squares, you like move the squares
around, you you quickly get something

760
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
around, you you quickly get something
 

761
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,990
around, you you quickly get something
that doesn't look like anything. So a

762
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
that doesn't look like anything. So a
 

763
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,390
that doesn't look like anything. So a
random permutation of pixels doesn't

764
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,400
random permutation of pixels doesn't
 

765
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,470
random permutation of pixels doesn't
look like an image. That means there's

766
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
look like an image. That means there's
 

767
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,630
look like an image. That means there's
something about the spatial arrangement

768
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
something about the spatial arrangement
 

769
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,789
something about the spatial arrangement
that matters. And in particular, the

770
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
that matters. And in particular, the
 

771
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,270
that matters. And in particular, the
view is that the very local arrangement

772
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,280
view is that the very local arrangement
 

773
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,070
view is that the very local arrangement
of p of what's going on in a in an image

774
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
of p of what's going on in a in an image
 

775
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,270
of p of what's going on in a in an image
matters. So people who' worked on

776
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280
matters. So people who' worked on
 

777
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,710
matters. So people who' worked on
computer vision for a long time thought

778
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
computer vision for a long time thought
 

779
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,510
computer vision for a long time thought
that there are things like edges and the

780
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520
that there are things like edges and the
 

781
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,549
that there are things like edges and the
edges in an image are very local.

782
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
edges in an image are very local.
 

783
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,310
edges in an image are very local.
They're having with contrast between

784
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
They're having with contrast between
 

785
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,510
They're having with contrast between
pixels right next to each other. So this

786
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:19,520
pixels right next to each other. So this
 

787
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,390
pixels right next to each other. So this
idea of respecting locality was a design

788
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
idea of respecting locality was a design
 

789
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,110
idea of respecting locality was a design
principle that they wanted. And what

790
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
principle that they wanted. And what
 

791
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,029
principle that they wanted. And what
does this end up having as a consequence

792
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:27,039
does this end up having as a consequence
 

793
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,270
does this end up having as a consequence
of thinking about this is the goal? We

794
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
of thinking about this is the goal? We
 

795
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,430
of thinking about this is the goal? We
end up

796
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,440
end up
 

797
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:42,870
end up
have having a convolutional structure

798
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:42,880

 

799
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:51,750

with small filters.

800
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760

 

801
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,070

So again the history of this is that

802
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,080
So again the history of this is that
 

803
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,390
So again the history of this is that
people when they were doing image

804
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
people when they were doing image
 

805
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,990
people when they were doing image
processing

806
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
processing
 

807
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,350
processing
before CNN's would use convolutions as

808
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
before CNN's would use convolutions as
 

809
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,630
before CNN's would use convolutions as
tools for doing image processing.

810
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
tools for doing image processing.
 

811
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,990
tools for doing image processing.
Why did they use convolutions? Because

812
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
Why did they use convolutions? Because
 

813
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,430
Why did they use convolutions? Because
convolutions arise naturally in signal

814
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,440
convolutions arise naturally in signal
 

815
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,750
convolutions arise naturally in signal
processing and they're local. So they

816
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:11,760
processing and they're local. So they
 

817
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,830
processing and they're local. So they
would use them and they were useful. So

818
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
would use them and they were useful. So
 

819
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,149
would use them and they were useful. So
they were like okay let's have a neural

820
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
they were like okay let's have a neural
 

821
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,270
they were like okay let's have a neural
net that also has convolutions in it.

822
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,280

 

823
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,669

Now another principle

824
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679

 

825
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,350

that they that people want is that

826
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
that they that people want is that
 

827
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,310
that they that people want is that
if you have an image and you do small

828
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
if you have an image and you do small
 

829
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,230
if you have an image and you do small
certain kinds of local transformations

830
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
certain kinds of local transformations
 

831
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,710
certain kinds of local transformations
to them it's the same image or almost

832
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
to them it's the same image or almost
 

833
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,830
to them it's the same image or almost
the same image. So if you take a cat in

834
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:43,840
the same image. So if you take a cat in
 

835
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,789
the same image. So if you take a cat in
an image and you move it five pixels to

836
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
an image and you move it five pixels to
 

837
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,870
an image and you move it five pixels to
the right, it's still a picture of a

838
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880
the right, it's still a picture of a
 

839
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,149
the right, it's still a picture of a
cat. In fact, the same cat.

840
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,159
cat. In fact, the same cat.
 

841
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,350
cat. In fact, the same cat.
So this is an idea that said, look, we

842
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
So this is an idea that said, look, we
 

843
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,190
So this is an idea that said, look, we
would like to respect

844
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200

 

845
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,029

certain

846
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039

 

847
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,789

invariances.

848
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:08,799

 

849
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,789

And other terms used are Equivariances

850
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:14,799

 

851
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,950

slightly technically different and

852
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:16,960
slightly technically different and
 

853
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:24,789
slightly technically different and
generally the idea of symmetries

854
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:24,799

 

855
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,350

in our problem domain.

856
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
in our problem domain.
 

857
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,830
in our problem domain.
Like for example, if you translate

858
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
Like for example, if you translate
 

859
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,110
Like for example, if you translate
something an edge or a circle in an

860
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,120
something an edge or a circle in an
 

861
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,510
something an edge or a circle in an
image to another place in the image,

862
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:35,520
image to another place in the image,
 

863
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,310
image to another place in the image,
it's still the same circle.

864
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,320
it's still the same circle.
 

865
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,549
it's still the same circle.
Okay. So what is the consequence in

866
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
Okay. So what is the consequence in
 

867
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,750
Okay. So what is the consequence in
terms of the engineering or the

868
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
terms of the engineering or the
 

869
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,029
terms of the engineering or the
architecture of doing something like

870
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
architecture of doing something like
 

871
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,830
architecture of doing something like
this is

872
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:47,840
this is
 

873
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,590
this is
there's actually two different ideas

874
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:49,600
there's actually two different ideas
 

875
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,390
there's actually two different ideas
that come out of this.

876
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
that come out of this.
 

877
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:00,310
that come out of this.
The first idea is weight sharing.

878
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320

 

879
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,149

Okay. So what's weight sharing? Weight

880
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
Okay. So what's weight sharing? Weight
 

881
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,230
Okay. So what's weight sharing? Weight
sharing is what's expressed in this

882
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,240
sharing is what's expressed in this
 

883
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,590
sharing is what's expressed in this
pattern here by the idea that the same

884
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
pattern here by the idea that the same
 

885
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,070
pattern here by the idea that the same
exact numbers

886
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,080
exact numbers
 

887
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,909
exact numbers
show up at different places

888
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:13,919
show up at different places
 

889
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,950
show up at different places
in this matrix, this larger matrix.

890
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:16,960
in this matrix, this larger matrix.
 

891
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,190
in this matrix, this larger matrix.
What does that mean? It means

892
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,200
What does that mean? It means
 

893
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,310
What does that mean? It means
practically if you've made a good weight

894
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
practically if you've made a good weight
 

895
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,830
practically if you've made a good weight
a set of weights that's a good edge

896
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:23,840
a set of weights that's a good edge
 

897
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,990
a set of weights that's a good edge
detector for example and it's a good

898
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,000
detector for example and it's a good
 

899
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,590
detector for example and it's a good
edge detector at this place in the image

900
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
edge detector at this place in the image
 

901
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,510
edge detector at this place in the image
it's probably also a good edge detector

902
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
it's probably also a good edge detector
 

903
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,990
it's probably also a good edge detector
over here in the image. So why should

904
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:34,000
over here in the image. So why should
 

905
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,870
over here in the image. So why should
you have to learn a fresh edge detector

906
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
you have to learn a fresh edge detector
 

907
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,590
you have to learn a fresh edge detector
over here from scratch when you know

908
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
over here from scratch when you know
 

909
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,110
over here from scratch when you know
that you just want to have a good edge

910
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,120
that you just want to have a good edge
 

911
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,470
that you just want to have a good edge
detector that works across the entire

912
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
detector that works across the entire
 

913
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,789
detector that works across the entire
image. So how do you translate that into

914
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
image. So how do you translate that into
 

915
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,549
image. So how do you translate that into
something you can do in architecture is

916
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
something you can do in architecture is
 

917
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,990
something you can do in architecture is
you say we'll just share the same

918
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
you say we'll just share the same
 

919
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,029
you say we'll just share the same
weights across the entire image and

920
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
weights across the entire image and
 

921
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,070
weights across the entire image and
that's what turns this uh that's one of

922
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,080
that's what turns this uh that's one of
 

923
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,070
that's what turns this uh that's one of
the core principles behind a CNN and it

924
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,080
the core principles behind a CNN and it
 

925
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,350
the core principles behind a CNN and it
says we're not only going to have a

926
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
says we're not only going to have a
 

927
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,789
says we're not only going to have a
convolutional structure with small

928
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
convolutional structure with small
 

929
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,950
convolutional structure with small
filters but they will be you know kind

930
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
filters but they will be you know kind
 

931
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,750
filters but they will be you know kind
of spatially invariant filters which is

932
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
of spatially invariant filters which is
 

933
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,590
of spatially invariant filters which is
the counterpart of like time invariance

934
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
the counterpart of like time invariance
 

935
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,070
the counterpart of like time invariance
in LTI for those who've seen it

936
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
in LTI for those who've seen it
 

937
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,070
in LTI for those who've seen it
But

938
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,080
But
 

939
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,470
But
it turns out that there's many other

940
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,480
it turns out that there's many other
 

941
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,590
it turns out that there's many other
symmetries that are present in images

942
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
symmetries that are present in images
 

943
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,789
symmetries that are present in images
that aren't easy to translate into

944
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799
that aren't easy to translate into
 

945
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,390
that aren't easy to translate into
weight sharing schemes. So for example,

946
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,400
weight sharing schemes. So for example,
 

947
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,310
weight sharing schemes. So for example,
in a an image, you might say, well, it's

948
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
in a an image, you might say, well, it's
 

949
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,310
in a an image, you might say, well, it's
not only that if you translate a circle,

950
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,320
not only that if you translate a circle,
 

951
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,990
not only that if you translate a circle,
it's the same circle. Circle is a bad

952
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
it's the same circle. Circle is a bad
 

953
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,190
it's the same circle. Circle is a bad
example. Okay, let's look at a a a kind

954
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
example. Okay, let's look at a a a kind
 

955
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,149
example. Okay, let's look at a a a kind
of squiggly shape of a star. Okay, like

956
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:42,159
of squiggly shape of a star. Okay, like
 

957
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,750
of squiggly shape of a star. Okay, like
a a star shape. If I take a star shape

958
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
a a star shape. If I take a star shape
 

959
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,669
a a star shape. If I take a star shape
and I take the star shape and I move it

960
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
and I take the star shape and I move it
 

961
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,750
and I take the star shape and I move it
around, it's still a star shape. But if

962
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
around, it's still a star shape. But if
 

963
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,830
around, it's still a star shape. But if
I take the star shape and I rotate it a

964
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840
I take the star shape and I rotate it a
 

965
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,510
I take the star shape and I rotate it a
little bit, it's still also a star

966
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,520
little bit, it's still also a star
 

967
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,909
little bit, it's still also a star
shape. In fact, the entire image, a

968
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
shape. In fact, the entire image, a
 

969
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,310
shape. In fact, the entire image, a
picture of a cat and a picture of a cat

970
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,320
picture of a cat and a picture of a cat
 

971
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,909
picture of a cat and a picture of a cat
taken with a camera that's slightly a

972
00:24:59,909 --> 00:24:59,919
taken with a camera that's slightly a
 

973
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,870
taken with a camera that's slightly a
skew is still a picture of a cat. So you

974
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
skew is still a picture of a cat. So you
 

975
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,310
skew is still a picture of a cat. So you
might think there's other symmetries

976
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,320
might think there's other symmetries
 

977
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:13,750
might think there's other symmetries
that are present like small

978
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:13,760

 

979
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,590

that has weight sharing taking care of

980
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
that has weight sharing taking care of
 

981
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,390
that has weight sharing taking care of
the idea of small rotations.

982
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
the idea of small rotations.
 

983
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,190
the idea of small rotations.
So you need some other standard trick

984
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200
So you need some other standard trick
 

985
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,669
So you need some other standard trick
that you can use when dealing with a

986
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:23,679
that you can use when dealing with a
 

987
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,990
that you can use when dealing with a
neural net to say I I actually believe

988
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
neural net to say I I actually believe
 

989
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,669
neural net to say I I actually believe
in some other symmetries that might

990
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
in some other symmetries that might
 

991
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,909
in some other symmetries that might
exist. And that other trick which we

992
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:29,919
exist. And that other trick which we
 

993
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,190
exist. And that other trick which we
will talk about today hopefully

994
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200
will talk about today hopefully
 

995
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,510
will talk about today hopefully
that also comes out of uh thinking about

996
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
that also comes out of uh thinking about
 

997
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:49,110
that also comes out of uh thinking about
what you want is data augmentations.

998
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,120

 

999
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,830

So this is different. We all like make

1000
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
So this is different. We all like make
 

1001
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,990
So this is different. We all like make
it with a mark it with a a color.

1002
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,000

 

1003
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,590

This is really about training.

1004
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:05,600

 

1005
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,110

So this is about how can I get it to

1006
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,120
So this is about how can I get it to
 

1007
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,750
So this is about how can I get it to
learn a certain symmetry if I can't

1008
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:09,760
learn a certain symmetry if I can't
 

1009
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,870
learn a certain symmetry if I can't
build it in. So one is there's two

1010
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:12,880
build it in. So one is there's two
 

1011
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,830
build it in. So one is there's two
approaches. One approach says uh

1012
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,840
approaches. One approach says uh
 

1013
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,510
approaches. One approach says uh
hopefully the data will speak for itself

1014
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
hopefully the data will speak for itself
 

1015
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,510
hopefully the data will speak for itself
and will reflect that symmetry and it'll

1016
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:19,520
and will reflect that symmetry and it'll
 

1017
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,750
and will reflect that symmetry and it'll
pick it up by itself. and the other says

1018
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:21,760
pick it up by itself. and the other says
 

1019
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,750
pick it up by itself. and the other says
I'm not sure the data will let me

1020
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,760
I'm not sure the data will let me
 

1021
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,909
I'm not sure the data will let me
actually make sure that the data the

1022
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
actually make sure that the data the
 

1023
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,549
actually make sure that the data the
model sees during training makes it

1024
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:28,559
model sees during training makes it
 

1025
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,470
model sees during training makes it
forces it to learn this symmetry that's

1026
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:30,480
forces it to learn this symmetry that's
 

1027
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,789
forces it to learn this symmetry that's
data augmentation

1028
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
data augmentation
 

1029
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,470
data augmentation
okay

1030
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480

 

1031
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,870

so another large idea that drives the uh

1032
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:42,880
so another large idea that drives the uh
 

1033
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,950
so another large idea that drives the uh
building of connets

1034
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:44,960
building of connets
 

1035
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,710
building of connets
is the idea that in vision problems you

1036
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
is the idea that in vision problems you
 

1037
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:58,789
is the idea that in vision problems you
have hierarchical structure

1038
00:26:58,789 --> 00:26:58,799

 

1039
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,630

which is basically

1040
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640

 

1041
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,870

parts

1042
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:04,880
parts
 

1043
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,669
parts
make holes.

1044
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:09,679

 

1045
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,350

So edges compose together and can form a

1046
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:13,360
So edges compose together and can form a
 

1047
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,350
So edges compose together and can form a
finger. So a finger is a whole compared

1048
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,360
finger. So a finger is a whole compared
 

1049
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,149
finger. So a finger is a whole compared
to edges. But fingers can come together

1050
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
to edges. But fingers can come together
 

1051
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,909
to edges. But fingers can come together
with palms to make a hand. And a hand is

1052
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:23,919
with palms to make a hand. And a hand is
 

1053
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,430
with palms to make a hand. And a hand is
a whole compared to a finger. And a hand

1054
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,440
a whole compared to a finger. And a hand
 

1055
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,510
a whole compared to a finger. And a hand
can come together with a forearm and so

1056
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:29,520
can come together with a forearm and so
 

1057
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,350
can come together with a forearm and so
on to come up with an entire arm. You

1058
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
on to come up with an entire arm. You
 

1059
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,990
on to come up with an entire arm. You
see what I'm saying? And lots of objects

1060
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,000
see what I'm saying? And lots of objects
 

1061
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,750
see what I'm saying? And lots of objects
in the real world are composed in this

1062
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:35,760
in the real world are composed in this
 

1063
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,149
in the real world are composed in this
hierarchical way that we can break it

1064
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
hierarchical way that we can break it
 

1065
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,510
hierarchical way that we can break it
down to subp parts, subpart parts, subp

1066
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:39,520
down to subp parts, subpart parts, subp
 

1067
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,470
down to subp parts, subpart parts, subp
parts, subp parts. Everyone with me?

1068
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:42,480
parts, subp parts. Everyone with me?
 

1069
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,669
parts, subp parts. Everyone with me?
This is something that exists uh in in

1070
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
This is something that exists uh in in
 

1071
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,310
This is something that exists uh in in
computer vision. and because it's

1072
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
computer vision. and because it's
 

1073
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,950
computer vision. and because it's
believed to exist in reality. Uh so

1074
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:52,960
believed to exist in reality. Uh so
 

1075
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,389
believed to exist in reality. Uh so
the question is how can we have an

1076
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:54,399
the question is how can we have an
 

1077
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,110
the question is how can we have an
architecture that

1078
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
architecture that
 

1079
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,590
architecture that
uh reflects this

1080
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
uh reflects this
 

1081
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,510
uh reflects this
and this is what leads to two things.

1082
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:03,520
and this is what leads to two things.
 

1083
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,149
and this is what leads to two things.
One is depth.

1084
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159

 

1085
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,029

You make your model deep with many

1086
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
You make your model deep with many
 

1087
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,669
You make your model deep with many
layers. Now this grew out of what people

1088
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679
layers. Now this grew out of what people
 

1089
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,669
layers. Now this grew out of what people
were already doing before in computer

1090
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:15,679
were already doing before in computer
 

1091
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,470
were already doing before in computer
vision pipelines. They would before when

1092
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:18,480
vision pipelines. They would before when
 

1093
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,389
vision pipelines. They would before when
everything was handcrafted, they would

1094
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:20,399
everything was handcrafted, they would
 

1095
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,590
everything was handcrafted, they would
say, "Well, I'll make a good edge

1096
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,600
say, "Well, I'll make a good edge
 

1097
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,630
say, "Well, I'll make a good edge
detector. Now, I'm going to make the

1098
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:24,640
detector. Now, I'm going to make the
 

1099
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,310
detector. Now, I'm going to make the
take the results of the edge detector

1100
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
take the results of the edge detector
 

1101
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,310
take the results of the edge detector
and collect it together to make a

1102
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,320
and collect it together to make a
 

1103
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,269
and collect it together to make a
subpart detector. Then I will take the

1104
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:31,279
subpart detector. Then I will take the
 

1105
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,149
subpart detector. Then I will take the
subpart detectors and I'll make compose

1106
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:34,159
subpart detectors and I'll make compose
 

1107
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,669
subpart detectors and I'll make compose
them together to get a larger part

1108
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:35,679
them together to get a larger part
 

1109
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,630
them together to get a larger part
detector and so on until I finally get a

1110
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:38,640
detector and so on until I finally get a
 

1111
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,389
detector and so on until I finally get a
hole.

1112
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
hole.
 

1113
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,510
hole.
So, they were already doing this

1114
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,520
So, they were already doing this
 

1115
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,470
So, they were already doing this
multi-stage kind of processing. So that

1116
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:44,480
multi-stage kind of processing. So that
 

1117
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,870
multi-stage kind of processing. So that
in neural nets became okay I will have

1118
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:46,880
in neural nets became okay I will have
 

1119
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,110
in neural nets became okay I will have
many different layers they'll feed one

1120
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
many different layers they'll feed one
 

1121
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,590
many different layers they'll feed one
into the other. So that's one thing that

1122
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
into the other. So that's one thing that
 

1123
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,750
into the other. So that's one thing that
you get from this kind of idea.

1124
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:55,760
you get from this kind of idea.
 

1125
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,190
you get from this kind of idea.
But there's another that comes along

1126
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,200
But there's another that comes along
 

1127
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,549
But there's another that comes along
with it

1128
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559

 

1129
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,630

and this is the idea of

1130
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:06,640
and this is the idea of
 

1131
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:15,029
and this is the idea of
multi-resolution.

1132
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:15,039

 

1133
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,950

and filter banks.

1134
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:20,960

 

1135
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,909

So again, what does this meaning? This

1136
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:23,919
So again, what does this meaning? This
 

1137
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,750
So again, what does this meaning? This
says that

1138
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:25,760
says that
 

1139
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,990
says that
when you're looking at a scene and

1140
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,000
when you're looking at a scene and
 

1141
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,669
when you're looking at a scene and
you're looking at it at the level, so

1142
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:29,679
you're looking at it at the level, so
 

1143
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,990
you're looking at it at the level, so
let me I'll use the example here. Okay,

1144
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,000
let me I'll use the example here. Okay,
 

1145
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,230
let me I'll use the example here. Okay,
so let's me zoom in.

1146
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,240
so let's me zoom in.
 

1147
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,430
so let's me zoom in.
Oh, okay. Unfortunately, there's a limit

1148
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:37,440
Oh, okay. Unfortunately, there's a limit
 

1149
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,470
Oh, okay. Unfortunately, there's a limit
to how much I can zoom. Uh uh so I

1150
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,480
to how much I can zoom. Uh uh so I
 

1151
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,110
to how much I can zoom. Uh uh so I
didn't think this through. Uh if you if

1152
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,120
didn't think this through. Uh if you if
 

1153
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,149
didn't think this through. Uh if you if
you were to z keep zooming in, right,

1154
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:46,159
you were to z keep zooming in, right,
 

1155
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,750
you were to z keep zooming in, right,
and look at this little little tiny

1156
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:47,760
and look at this little little tiny
 

1157
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,830
and look at this little little tiny
space here,

1158
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:49,840
space here,
 

1159
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,870
space here,
you can't really make out at that zoomed

1160
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:52,880
you can't really make out at that zoomed
 

1161
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,549
you can't really make out at that zoomed
in scale. You're not really seeing the

1162
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
in scale. You're not really seeing the
 

1163
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,590
in scale. You're not really seeing the
hole. You see the hole when you like

1164
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,600
hole. You see the hole when you like
 

1165
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,230
hole. You see the hole when you like
zoom out a bit. Then you can see the

1166
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,240
zoom out a bit. Then you can see the
 

1167
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,590
zoom out a bit. Then you can see the
hole. And if you the intuition here is

1168
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,600
hole. And if you the intuition here is
 

1169
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,470
hole. And if you the intuition here is
that if you wanted to capture a sense of

1170
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,480
that if you wanted to capture a sense of
 

1171
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,870
that if you wanted to capture a sense of
what this image is at a lower

1172
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
what this image is at a lower
 

1173
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,630
what this image is at a lower
resolution,

1174
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:10,640
resolution,
 

1175
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,190
resolution,
this actually makes sense, you can do

1176
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,200
this actually makes sense, you can do
 

1177
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,029
this actually makes sense, you can do
that. You can have a picture and you can

1178
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:15,039
that. You can have a picture and you can
 

1179
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,950
that. You can have a picture and you can
have that same picture at a lower

1180
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:16,960
have that same picture at a lower
 

1181
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,070
have that same picture at a lower
resolution and you expect a picture at a

1182
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,080
resolution and you expect a picture at a
 

1183
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,029
resolution and you expect a picture at a
lower resolution will still have the big

1184
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
lower resolution will still have the big
 

1185
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,990
lower resolution will still have the big
things the same, but it might not have

1186
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,000
things the same, but it might not have
 

1187
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,310
things the same, but it might not have
all the small things.

1188
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,320
all the small things.
 

1189
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,549
all the small things.
Okay, this is the idea that you can

1190
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:30,559
Okay, this is the idea that you can
 

1191
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,830
Okay, this is the idea that you can
understand these things at different

1192
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
understand these things at different
 

1193
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,990
understand these things at different
resolutions.

1194
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,000
resolutions.
 

1195
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,230
resolutions.
So this is the multi-resolution idea

1196
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,240
So this is the multi-resolution idea
 

1197
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,230
So this is the multi-resolution idea
and the filterbank idea is sort of goes

1198
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
and the filterbank idea is sort of goes
 

1199
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,510
and the filterbank idea is sort of goes
along with it which says

1200
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,520
along with it which says
 

1201
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,430
along with it which says
at a very small scale. So this is maybe

1202
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
at a very small scale. So this is maybe
 

1203
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,310
at a very small scale. So this is maybe
coming out of even science. uh at a very

1204
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,320
coming out of even science. uh at a very
 

1205
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,310
coming out of even science. uh at a very
small scale the number of different

1206
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
small scale the number of different
 

1207
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,549
small scale the number of different
things is small

1208
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
things is small
 

1209
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,710
things is small
but as you get to larger and larger

1210
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:56,720
but as you get to larger and larger
 

1211
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,750
but as you get to larger and larger
scales the number of different things is

1212
00:30:59,750 --> 00:30:59,760
scales the number of different things is
 

1213
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,669
scales the number of different things is
larger.

1214
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:01,679
larger.
 

1215
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,269
larger.
So at a small scale you might have you

1216
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:03,279
So at a small scale you might have you
 

1217
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,789
So at a small scale you might have you
know certain kind of edges certain kind

1218
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
know certain kind of edges certain kind
 

1219
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,669
know certain kind of edges certain kind
of gradients things like this but at a

1220
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:07,679
of gradients things like this but at a
 

1221
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,110
of gradients things like this but at a
slightly bigger scale you have like

1222
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,120
slightly bigger scale you have like
 

1223
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,070
slightly bigger scale you have like
little like pieces components of things

1224
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,080
little like pieces components of things
 

1225
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,990
little like pieces components of things
and an even larger scale you have even a

1226
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,000
and an even larger scale you have even a
 

1227
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,470
and an even larger scale you have even a
larger set of possible things you might

1228
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:16,480
larger set of possible things you might
 

1229
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,830
larger set of possible things you might
be interested in. So

1230
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,840
be interested in. So
 

1231
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,389
be interested in. So
this is the idea related to the idea

1232
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:22,399
this is the idea related to the idea
 

1233
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,230
this is the idea related to the idea
from signal processing of filter banks

1234
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:24,240
from signal processing of filter banks
 

1235
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,310
from signal processing of filter banks
that you might have a bank of filters

1236
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,320
that you might have a bank of filters
 

1237
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,070
that you might have a bank of filters
and the number of filters might be

1238
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
and the number of filters might be
 

1239
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,750
and the number of filters might be
different at different resolutions

1240
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:29,760
different at different resolutions
 

1241
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,870
different at different resolutions
because the number of things you're

1242
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:30,880
because the number of things you're
 

1243
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,310
because the number of things you're
looking for is different at different

1244
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:32,320
looking for is different at different
 

1245
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,470
looking for is different at different
resolutions.

1246
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,480
resolutions.
 

1247
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,269
resolutions.
Okay, so this is all be beame another

1248
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:37,279
Okay, so this is all be beame another
 

1249
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,070
Okay, so this is all be beame another
very key uh

1250
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,080
very key uh
 

1251
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,430
very key uh
way of actually doing the design of a

1252
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,440
way of actually doing the design of a
 

1253
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,789
way of actually doing the design of a
convolutional neural network.

1254
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
convolutional neural network.
 

1255
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,070
convolutional neural network.
So hopefully I will be able to talk

1256
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
So hopefully I will be able to talk
 

1257
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,470
So hopefully I will be able to talk
about all of these things uh today to

1258
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:50,480
about all of these things uh today to
 

1259
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,950
about all of these things uh today to
you know kind of flesh them all out but

1260
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:52,960
you know kind of flesh them all out but
 

1261
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,710
you know kind of flesh them all out but
I wanted to acknowledge something from a

1262
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
I wanted to acknowledge something from a
 

1263
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,870
I wanted to acknowledge something from a
deep learning perspective which was

1264
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:58,880
deep learning perspective which was
 

1265
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,630
deep learning perspective which was
that

1266
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:00,640
that
 

1267
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,669
that
in the early days of neural nets people

1268
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:03,679
in the early days of neural nets people
 

1269
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,909
in the early days of neural nets people
would try to apply so the all these

1270
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
would try to apply so the all these
 

1271
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,310
would try to apply so the all these
ideas are pretty old

1272
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
ideas are pretty old
 

1273
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,710
ideas are pretty old
right and people knew about this way of

1274
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:10,720
right and people knew about this way of
 

1275
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,509
right and people knew about this way of
thinking back in the 1980s

1276
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:13,519
thinking back in the 1980s
 

1277
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,029
thinking back in the 1980s
uh and they would try to make a deep

1278
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039
uh and they would try to make a deep
 

1279
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,950
uh and they would try to make a deep
neural net and to have you know weight

1280
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:20,960
neural net and to have you know weight
 

1281
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,470
neural net and to have you know weight
sharing and I think even convolutional

1282
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
sharing and I think even convolutional
 

1283
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,870
sharing and I think even convolutional
structures were in the early 90s um to

1284
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:24,880
structures were in the early 90s um to
 

1285
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,029
structures were in the early 90s um to
try them out in neural nets but it was

1286
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:27,039
try them out in neural nets but it was
 

1287
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,149
try them out in neural nets but it was
very hard to get them to train so simply

1288
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:30,159
very hard to get them to train so simply
 

1289
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,470
very hard to get them to train so simply
having the right expressive expressivity

1290
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,480
having the right expressive expressivity
 

1291
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,509
having the right expressive expressivity
isn't enough you have to also have get

1292
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:35,519
isn't enough you have to also have get
 

1293
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,830
isn't enough you have to also have get
them to work

1294
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:37,840
them to work
 

1295
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:45,110
them to work
so there's other key ideas

1296
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,120

 

1297
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,110

which is I'll call them in the getting

1298
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,120
which is I'll call them in the getting
 

1299
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:55,590
which is I'll call them in the getting
it to work

1300
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600

 

1301
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,269

and here I will list them

1302
00:32:59,269 --> 00:32:59,279
and here I will list them
 

1303
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,909
and here I will list them
uh and

1304
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
uh and
 

1305
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,909
uh and
some of the key highlights that are

1306
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:03,919
some of the key highlights that are
 

1307
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,549
some of the key highlights that are
common u one of them is the idea of

1308
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:06,559
common u one of them is the idea of
 

1309
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:19,110
common u one of them is the idea of
normalization

1310
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120

 

1311
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,110

So what normalization layers do is they

1312
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,120
So what normalization layers do is they
 

1313
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,990
So what normalization layers do is they
don't have any expressive uh capacity.

1314
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
don't have any expressive uh capacity.
 

1315
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,269
don't have any expressive uh capacity.
They don't they're not trying to express

1316
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
They don't they're not trying to express
 

1317
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,909
They don't they're not trying to express
anything. What they're trying to do is

1318
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:27,919
anything. What they're trying to do is
 

1319
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,230
anything. What they're trying to do is
to make sure that the activations and

1320
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240
to make sure that the activations and
 

1321
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,430
to make sure that the activations and
the gradients in during training of a

1322
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,440
the gradients in during training of a
 

1323
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,750
the gradients in during training of a
neural net stay in the right place.

1324
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
neural net stay in the right place.
 

1325
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,590
neural net stay in the right place.
So you've already seen this in the

1326
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:39,600
So you've already seen this in the
 

1327
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,669
So you've already seen this in the
discussions when we're talking about

1328
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
discussions when we're talking about
 

1329
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,110
discussions when we're talking about
like MUP and muon where we said look

1330
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,120
like MUP and muon where we said look
 

1331
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,110
like MUP and muon where we said look
this RMS norm is very important and

1332
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,120
this RMS norm is very important and
 

1333
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,430
this RMS norm is very important and
interesting and so uh we'll see that

1334
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,440
interesting and so uh we'll see that
 

1335
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,950
interesting and so uh we'll see that
even if in principle at initialization

1336
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:56,960
even if in principle at initialization
 

1337
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,430
even if in principle at initialization
you could have a property that all the

1338
00:33:59,430 --> 00:33:59,440
you could have a property that all the
 

1339
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,509
you could have a property that all the
RMS norms are nicely controlled in

1340
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
RMS norms are nicely controlled in
 

1341
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,430
RMS norms are nicely controlled in
expectation

1342
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,440
expectation
 

1343
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,990
expectation
uh and you could have the property that

1344
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,000
uh and you could have the property that
 

1345
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,270
uh and you could have the property that
at the first step of training all of the

1346
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:09,280
at the first step of training all of the
 

1347
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,629
at the first step of training all of the
updates you do will not mess that up.

1348
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
updates you do will not mess that up.
 

1349
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,589
updates you do will not mess that up.
uh in practice it can be the case that

1350
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:15,599
uh in practice it can be the case that
 

1351
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,710
uh in practice it can be the case that
as you keep training those RMS norms

1352
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:18,720
as you keep training those RMS norms
 

1353
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,869
as you keep training those RMS norms
will start moving and changing and at

1354
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:22,879
will start moving and changing and at
 

1355
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,030
will start moving and changing and at
some point bad things will happen

1356
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,040
some point bad things will happen
 

1357
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,629
some point bad things will happen
because if you were thinking because you

1358
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
because if you were thinking because you
 

1359
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,310
because if you were thinking because you
set the learning rate assuming that the

1360
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,320
set the learning rate assuming that the
 

1361
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,230
set the learning rate assuming that the
input layer input to a certain layer had

1362
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,240
input layer input to a certain layer had
 

1363
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,310
input layer input to a certain layer had
RMS norm one and you want to make sure

1364
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:32,320
RMS norm one and you want to make sure
 

1365
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,069
RMS norm one and you want to make sure
the update was the right size and now

1366
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
the update was the right size and now
 

1367
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,230
the update was the right size and now
suddenly the RMS norm of the input to

1368
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
suddenly the RMS norm of the input to
 

1369
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,909
suddenly the RMS norm of the input to
that layer is 100 the update is going to

1370
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:39,919
that layer is 100 the update is going to
 

1371
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,550
that layer is 100 the update is going to
be a 100 times bigger

1372
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:42,560
be a 100 times bigger
 

1373
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,829
be a 100 times bigger
which could then put you in the wrong

1374
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:43,839
which could then put you in the wrong
 

1375
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,030
which could then put you in the wrong
place. So in practice, getting things to

1376
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,040
place. So in practice, getting things to
 

1377
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,669
place. So in practice, getting things to
train and to train stably involves the

1378
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:49,679
train and to train stably involves the
 

1379
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,510
train and to train stably involves the
introduction of normalization layers.

1380
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:51,520
introduction of normalization layers.
 

1381
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,950
introduction of normalization layers.
And there's a whole story of how

1382
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:52,960
And there's a whole story of how
 

1383
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,790
And there's a whole story of how
normalization layers have changed. Even

1384
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:54,800
normalization layers have changed. Even
 

1385
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,990
normalization layers have changed. Even
the first papers in the modern current

1386
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,000
the first papers in the modern current
 

1387
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,550
the first papers in the modern current
era of neural nets had kinds of

1388
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,560
era of neural nets had kinds of
 

1389
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,950
era of neural nets had kinds of
normalization layers put in. They're not

1390
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:02,960
normalization layers put in. They're not
 

1391
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,470
normalization layers put in. They're not
the kinds of normalizations we're going

1392
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:04,480
the kinds of normalizations we're going
 

1393
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,750
the kinds of normalizations we're going
to teach now, but they are like the

1394
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:05,760
to teach now, but they are like the
 

1395
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,069
to teach now, but they are like the
precursors to those because of this

1396
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
precursors to those because of this
 

1397
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,349
precursors to those because of this
issue that you had to get things to

1398
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359
issue that you had to get things to
 

1399
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,030
issue that you had to get things to
work. And this was a very very key thing

1400
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,040
work. And this was a very very key thing
 

1401
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,910
work. And this was a very very key thing
that you needed.

1402
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:13,920
that you needed.
 

1403
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,829
that you needed.
Okay. So we'll talk about those.

1404
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:19,839

 

1405
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:25,829

Another trick that is uh useful to get

1406
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:25,839
Another trick that is uh useful to get
 

1407
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,150
Another trick that is uh useful to get
things to work uh and to train well is

1408
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,160
things to work uh and to train well is
 

1409
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,710
things to work uh and to train well is
the idea of uh dropout

1410
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:36,720

 

1411
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,230

which is very interesting because

1412
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,240
which is very interesting because
 

1413
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,390
which is very interesting because
dropout actually neither originated

1414
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,400
dropout actually neither originated
 

1415
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,150
dropout actually neither originated
uh nor is primarily continentbased.

1416
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,160
uh nor is primarily continentbased.
 

1417
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,270
uh nor is primarily continentbased.
However, early connet implementations

1418
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
However, early connet implementations
 

1419
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,069
However, early connet implementations
and the getting Cognist to work uh

1420
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:52,079
and the getting Cognist to work uh
 

1421
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,310
and the getting Cognist to work uh
really swore by dropout that there was a

1422
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,320
really swore by dropout that there was a
 

1423
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,589
really swore by dropout that there was a
whole period in which people were

1424
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:55,599
whole period in which people were
 

1425
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,109
whole period in which people were
wondering do you need to use dropout or

1426
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:57,119
wondering do you need to use dropout or
 

1427
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,990
wondering do you need to use dropout or
not and then people settled on the idea

1428
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
not and then people settled on the idea
 

1429
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,910
not and then people settled on the idea
that even in contemporary networks you

1430
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
that even in contemporary networks you
 

1431
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,910
that even in contemporary networks you
use dropout in the right places uh

1432
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:03,920
use dropout in the right places uh
 

1433
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,470
use dropout in the right places uh
because it helps training a little bit.

1434
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:06,480
because it helps training a little bit.
 

1435
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,750
because it helps training a little bit.
Okay, so but that's another kind of

1436
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:07,760
Okay, so but that's another kind of
 

1437
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,349
Okay, so but that's another kind of
trick that we will talk about.

1438
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:13,359

 

1439
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,349

And the third very uh key idea in

1440
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:17,359
And the third very uh key idea in
 

1441
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,870
And the third very uh key idea in
getting large deep networks to work is

1442
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:20,880
getting large deep networks to work is
 

1443
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,150
getting large deep networks to work is
called

1444
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,160

 

1445
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,550

residual

1446
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:26,560
residual
 

1447
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,990
residual
or sometimes called skip connections.

1448
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,000

 

1449
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,430

So I'm not sure I'll be able to get to

1450
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:35,440
So I'm not sure I'll be able to get to
 

1451
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,510
So I'm not sure I'll be able to get to
these today. Um but

1452
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:39,520
these today. Um but
 

1453
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,510
these today. Um but
they are very important. They persist

1454
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:41,520
they are very important. They persist
 

1455
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,790
they are very important. They persist
not only in uh connets but in all modern

1456
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:44,800
not only in uh connets but in all modern
 

1457
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,310
not only in uh connets but in all modern
architectures.

1458
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:46,320
architectures.
 

1459
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,950
architectures.
uh and they have an interesting story

1460
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:48,960
uh and they have an interesting story
 

1461
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,710
uh and they have an interesting story
which I'll preview for you a tiny bit

1462
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:50,720
which I'll preview for you a tiny bit
 

1463
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,390
which I'll preview for you a tiny bit
here which is that you already know the

1464
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:54,400
here which is that you already know the
 

1465
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,150
here which is that you already know the
answer to this question but I will make

1466
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
answer to this question but I will make
 

1467
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,710
answer to this question but I will make
sure you can see it again which is

1468
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:58,720
sure you can see it again which is
 

1469
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,109
sure you can see it again which is
sometimes there's a tension between what

1470
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:01,119
sometimes there's a tension between what
 

1471
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,990
sometimes there's a tension between what
makes sense and what works

1472
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,000
makes sense and what works
 

1473
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,870
makes sense and what works
and deep learning always makes one

1474
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:08,880
and deep learning always makes one
 

1475
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,750
and deep learning always makes one
choice which is you do the thing that

1476
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:11,760
choice which is you do the thing that
 

1477
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,670
choice which is you do the thing that
works even if it doesn't make any sense

1478
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:15,680
works even if it doesn't make any sense
 

1479
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,750
works even if it doesn't make any sense
Okay. And so you most of the time you

1480
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:19,760
Okay. And so you most of the time you
 

1481
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,589
Okay. And so you most of the time you
can not feel this, but residual and skip

1482
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:23,599
can not feel this, but residual and skip
 

1483
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,589
can not feel this, but residual and skip
connections should definitely make you

1484
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:25,599
connections should definitely make you
 

1485
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,990
connections should definitely make you
feel, wait, this does not make sense.

1486
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,000
feel, wait, this does not make sense.
 

1487
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,750
feel, wait, this does not make sense.
This seems to violate what we talked

1488
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:29,760
This seems to violate what we talked
 

1489
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,550
This seems to violate what we talked
about up here. And the answer is yes. At

1490
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:32,560
about up here. And the answer is yes. At
 

1491
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,470
about up here. And the answer is yes. At
a philosophical intuitive level, it

1492
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:34,480
a philosophical intuitive level, it
 

1493
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,510
a philosophical intuitive level, it
does, but it works. So

1494
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,520
does, but it works. So
 

1495
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,589
does, but it works. So
that's more important.

1496
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:39,599
that's more important.
 

1497
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,790
that's more important.
Um, okay.

1498
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:42,800
Um, okay.
 

1499
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,150
Um, okay.
So this is like kind of a high level

1500
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
So this is like kind of a high level
 

1501
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,349
So this is like kind of a high level
picture again because most of you have

1502
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:45,359
picture again because most of you have
 

1503
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,030
picture again because most of you have
seen it. I wanted to organize that

1504
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,040
seen it. I wanted to organize that
 

1505
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,270
seen it. I wanted to organize that
different things you've seen into a kind

1506
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:49,280
different things you've seen into a kind
 

1507
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,710
different things you've seen into a kind
of framework of like what's the

1508
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:50,720
of framework of like what's the
 

1509
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,150
of framework of like what's the
difference between these these things.

1510
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,160
difference between these these things.
 

1511
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,750
difference between these these things.
Some are there for expressivity and some

1512
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
Some are there for expressivity and some
 

1513
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,390
Some are there for expressivity and some
are for getting things to work. Okay. So

1514
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,400
are for getting things to work. Okay. So
 

1515
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,589
are for getting things to work. Okay. So
now let's uh you know get into the uh

1516
00:37:59,589 --> 00:37:59,599
now let's uh you know get into the uh
 

1517
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,710
now let's uh you know get into the uh
mechanics here a little bit.

1518
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:02,720
mechanics here a little bit.
 

1519
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,270
mechanics here a little bit.
So think about uh you know convolution.

1520
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,280
So think about uh you know convolution.
 

1521
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,829
So think about uh you know convolution.
So first thing I want to recognize is

1522
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:11,839
So first thing I want to recognize is
 

1523
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,550
So first thing I want to recognize is
we call them con convolutional neural

1524
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:14,560
we call them con convolutional neural
 

1525
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,990
we call them con convolutional neural
nets and they're named after

1526
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:16,000
nets and they're named after
 

1527
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,550
nets and they're named after
convolution. But if you go and look up

1528
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:18,560
convolution. But if you go and look up
 

1529
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,990
convolution. But if you go and look up
con the standard definition of

1530
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,000
con the standard definition of
 

1531
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,750
con the standard definition of
convolution, it might not agree with

1532
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760
convolution, it might not agree with
 

1533
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,270
convolution, it might not agree with
what you see in a connet. So we have to

1534
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,280
what you see in a connet. So we have to
 

1535
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,670
what you see in a connet. So we have to
like let's deal with that squarely now.

1536
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:25,680
like let's deal with that squarely now.
 

1537
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,710
like let's deal with that squarely now.
And then from now on after this one

1538
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:28,720
And then from now on after this one
 

1539
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,750
And then from now on after this one
mention I will talk about convolution in

1540
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:31,760
mention I will talk about convolution in
 

1541
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,069
mention I will talk about convolution in
the neural net style as opposed to the

1542
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
the neural net style as opposed to the
 

1543
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,990
the neural net style as opposed to the
standard style.

1544
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,000
standard style.
 

1545
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,349
standard style.
So you might have seen convolution in uh

1546
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:39,359
So you might have seen convolution in uh
 

1547
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,109
So you might have seen convolution in uh
a class on where we talked about linear

1548
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:41,119
a class on where we talked about linear
 

1549
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,030
a class on where we talked about linear
time invariant systems. You might have

1550
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,040
time invariant systems. You might have
 

1551
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,589
time invariant systems. You might have
seen this idea in a physics class. You

1552
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
seen this idea in a physics class. You
 

1553
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,589
seen this idea in a physics class. You
might have seen it in the context of

1554
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:47,599
might have seen it in the context of
 

1555
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,030
might have seen it in the context of
Green's functions and solving

1556
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,040
Green's functions and solving
 

1557
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,950
Green's functions and solving
differential equations and stuff. Lots

1558
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:50,960
differential equations and stuff. Lots
 

1559
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,589
differential equations and stuff. Lots
of places you might have seen it. But

1560
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:53,599
of places you might have seen it. But
 

1561
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,310
of places you might have seen it. But
what how is it defined? It's typically

1562
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:56,320
what how is it defined? It's typically
 

1563
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,190
what how is it defined? It's typically
defined in continuous time first for

1564
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,200
defined in continuous time first for
 

1565
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,230
defined in continuous time first for
one-dimensional uh signal. And it says

1566
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:02,240
one-dimensional uh signal. And it says
 

1567
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,349
one-dimensional uh signal. And it says
you want the convolution of some x of t

1568
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:05,359
you want the convolution of some x of t
 

1569
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,390
you want the convolution of some x of t
and some h of t. And how do you do it?

1570
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,400
and some h of t. And how do you do it?
 

1571
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,670
and some h of t. And how do you do it?
You take the integral from minus

1572
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:09,680
You take the integral from minus
 

1573
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,510
You take the integral from minus
infinity to infinity. You have a dummy

1574
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
infinity to infinity. You have a dummy
 

1575
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,990
infinity to infinity. You have a dummy
variable of integration which takes x of

1576
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,000
variable of integration which takes x of
 

1577
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,870
variable of integration which takes x of
toao and then you multiply that by h of

1578
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:16,880
toao and then you multiply that by h of
 

1579
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,910
toao and then you multiply that by h of
t minus toao. Very important thing is

1580
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:19,920
t minus toao. Very important thing is
 

1581
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,390
t minus toao. Very important thing is
this minus toao.

1582
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:22,400
this minus toao.
 

1583
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,630
this minus toao.
So in LTI class you might have heard

1584
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:24,640
So in LTI class you might have heard
 

1585
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,790
So in LTI class you might have heard
this talk about flip and drag. one of

1586
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:26,800
this talk about flip and drag. one of
 

1587
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,150
this talk about flip and drag. one of
the signals is flipped and then dragged

1588
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,160
the signals is flipped and then dragged
 

1589
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,150
the signals is flipped and then dragged
across the other to do an averaging.

1590
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,160
across the other to do an averaging.
 

1591
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,030
across the other to do an averaging.
Okay? And

1592
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,040
Okay? And
 

1593
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,710
Okay? And
there's a nice property of convolution

1594
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:36,720
there's a nice property of convolution
 

1595
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,670
there's a nice property of convolution
that you can choose which one you flip.

1596
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:39,680
that you can choose which one you flip.
 

1597
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,670
that you can choose which one you flip.
It's fine. You get the same answer. So

1598
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:43,680
It's fine. You get the same answer. So
 

1599
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,910
It's fine. You get the same answer. So
uh you know you see things like this.

1600
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:45,920
uh you know you see things like this.
 

1601
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,310
uh you know you see things like this.
Now you can also do this in discrete uh

1602
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:48,320
Now you can also do this in discrete uh
 

1603
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,069
Now you can also do this in discrete uh
time which is of course relevant for the

1604
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:50,079
time which is of course relevant for the
 

1605
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,750
time which is of course relevant for the
case of neural nets. So for a

1606
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:51,760
case of neural nets. So for a
 

1607
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,630
case of neural nets. So for a
one-dimensional input, you can think of

1608
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:54,640
one-dimensional input, you can think of
 

1609
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,109
one-dimensional input, you can think of
x now at index t. So y at index t

1610
00:39:59,109 --> 00:39:59,119
x now at index t. So y at index t
 

1611
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,109
x now at index t. So y at index t
defined as a sum instead of an integral.

1612
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:01,119
defined as a sum instead of an integral.
 

1613
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,150
defined as a sum instead of an integral.
And you literally just replace the

1614
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,160
And you literally just replace the
 

1615
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,790
And you literally just replace the
integrals with sums.

1616
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:04,800
integrals with sums.
 

1617
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,270
integrals with sums.
But and again the same flipping can

1618
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,280
But and again the same flipping can
 

1619
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,589
But and again the same flipping can
happen. You can choose either one to to

1620
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:09,599
happen. You can choose either one to to
 

1621
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,470
happen. You can choose either one to to
flip. You get the same answer.

1622
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480
flip. You get the same answer.
 

1623
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,870
flip. You get the same answer.
But the case of uh discrete val time uh

1624
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:18,880
But the case of uh discrete val time uh
 

1625
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,630
But the case of uh discrete val time uh
is very important because it also

1626
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,640
is very important because it also
 

1627
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,430
is very important because it also
introduces the idea of a finite impulse

1628
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:23,440
introduces the idea of a finite impulse
 

1629
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,109
introduces the idea of a finite impulse
response uh case. So finite impulse

1630
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:27,119
response uh case. So finite impulse
 

1631
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,630
response uh case. So finite impulse
response case is the case fir in which

1632
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:30,640
response case is the case fir in which
 

1633
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,870
response case is the case fir in which
the filter h is only non zero at a

1634
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:34,880
the filter h is only non zero at a
 

1635
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,670
the filter h is only non zero at a
finite number of places. So it's only

1636
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:37,680
finite number of places. So it's only
 

1637
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,349
finite number of places. So it's only
non zero from minus k to plus k. So

1638
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:41,359
non zero from minus k to plus k. So
 

1639
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,270
non zero from minus k to plus k. So
suddenly this infinite sum becomes a

1640
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,280
suddenly this infinite sum becomes a
 

1641
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,990
suddenly this infinite sum becomes a
finite sum and you have this structure

1642
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,000
finite sum and you have this structure
 

1643
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,510
finite sum and you have this structure
here

1644
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:47,520
here
 

1645
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,750
here
where you say each of the different hes

1646
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:51,760
where you say each of the different hes
 

1647
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,710
where you say each of the different hes
that you have multiplies a sliding

1648
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:54,720
that you have multiplies a sliding
 

1649
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,069
that you have multiplies a sliding
window of x's.

1650
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:58,079
window of x's.
 

1651
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,829
window of x's.
Okay. So if you want to know what y is

1652
00:40:59,829 --> 00:40:59,839
Okay. So if you want to know what y is
 

1653
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,069
Okay. So if you want to know what y is
at t, you look at the corresponding

1654
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:02,079
at t, you look at the corresponding
 

1655
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,870
at t, you look at the corresponding
neighborhood of x in the neighborhood of

1656
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:04,880
neighborhood of x in the neighborhood of
 

1657
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,990
neighborhood of x in the neighborhood of
t. K steps in one direction and k steps

1658
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,000
t. K steps in one direction and k steps
 

1659
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,230
t. K steps in one direction and k steps
in the other direction.

1660
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:10,240
in the other direction.
 

1661
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,550
in the other direction.
everyone just brings back memories if

1662
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
everyone just brings back memories if
 

1663
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,750
everyone just brings back memories if
you've seen it before. If you haven't,

1664
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:13,760
you've seen it before. If you haven't,
 

1665
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,349
you've seen it before. If you haven't,
it's fine. But I want to acknowledge

1666
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
it's fine. But I want to acknowledge
 

1667
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,710
it's fine. But I want to acknowledge
this. So very important point.

1668
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:20,720
this. So very important point.
 

1669
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,750
this. So very important point.
I will use a different color.

1670
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:23,760
I will use a different color.
 

1671
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,829
I will use a different color.
Pink

1672
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:27,839

 

1673
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:34,710

in deep learning.

1674
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:34,720

 

1675
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:42,630

We don't flip.

1676
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:42,640

 

1677
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,390

Okay, we don't worry about flipping the

1678
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:44,400
Okay, we don't worry about flipping the
 

1679
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,190
Okay, we don't worry about flipping the
filter. We say because there's a clear

1680
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,200
filter. We say because there's a clear
 

1681
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,109
filter. We say because there's a clear
distinction. The flipping is very

1682
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:49,119
distinction. The flipping is very
 

1683
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,870
distinction. The flipping is very
important because mathematically when

1684
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:50,880
important because mathematically when
 

1685
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,150
important because mathematically when
thinking about convolution in many

1686
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,160
thinking about convolution in many
 

1687
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,710
thinking about convolution in many
settings, you want to take this idea

1688
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:54,720
settings, you want to take this idea
 

1689
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,069
settings, you want to take this idea
that well, it's kind of symmetric and

1690
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,079
that well, it's kind of symmetric and
 

1691
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,550
that well, it's kind of symmetric and
it's two arguments and use that uh for

1692
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:58,560
it's two arguments and use that uh for
 

1693
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,990
it's two arguments and use that uh for
proofs and for other things. So, it's

1694
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000
proofs and for other things. So, it's
 

1695
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,390
proofs and for other things. So, it's
very important to understand how to use

1696
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
very important to understand how to use
 

1697
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,550
very important to understand how to use
one or the other. But in deep learning

1698
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:04,560
one or the other. But in deep learning
 

1699
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,230
one or the other. But in deep learning
context, we always know this is the

1700
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,240
context, we always know this is the
 

1701
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,430
context, we always know this is the
input and this is the filter. We never

1702
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,440
input and this is the filter. We never
 

1703
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,430
input and this is the filter. We never
view them in the other other way. At

1704
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:11,440
view them in the other other way. At
 

1705
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,750
view them in the other other way. At
least most of the time we don't. So in

1706
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:13,760
least most of the time we don't. So in
 

1707
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,030
least most of the time we don't. So in
that case, we're not worried about kind

1708
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,040
that case, we're not worried about kind
 

1709
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,230
that case, we're not worried about kind
of thinking about the symmetry between

1710
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:16,240
of thinking about the symmetry between
 

1711
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,630
of thinking about the symmetry between
these two objects. So we just take the

1712
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:18,640
these two objects. So we just take the
 

1713
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,470
these two objects. So we just take the
filter and flip it and we just call that

1714
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
filter and flip it and we just call that
 

1715
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,710
filter and flip it and we just call that
the filter.

1716
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:22,720
the filter.
 

1717
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,990
the filter.
Okay? So we don't have any of the

1718
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,000
Okay? So we don't have any of the
 

1719
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,349
Okay? So we don't have any of the
flipping.

1720
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:25,359
flipping.
 

1721
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:33,829
flipping.
So if you look uh here at uh

1722
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:33,839

 

1723
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,150

this particular

1724
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,160
this particular
 

1725
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,950
this particular
this I'll make again here no flipping

1726
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:42,960

 

1727
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,550

prints a very nice figure where you can

1728
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:44,560
prints a very nice figure where you can
 

1729
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,510
prints a very nice figure where you can
think of it as you have three weights

1730
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:47,520
think of it as you have three weights
 

1731
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,750
think of it as you have three weights
for an FIR filter of length three. So

1732
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:49,760
for an FIR filter of length three. So
 

1733
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,630
for an FIR filter of length three. So
that would correspond to K of one one

1734
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:52,640
that would correspond to K of one one
 

1735
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,710
that would correspond to K of one one
before and one after. So if I want to

1736
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:54,720
before and one after. So if I want to
 

1737
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,710
before and one after. So if I want to
know the output

1738
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:56,720
know the output
 

1739
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,870
know the output
uh Z2, I take all of these X's, I

1740
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:00,880
uh Z2, I take all of these X's, I
 

1741
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,550
uh Z2, I take all of these X's, I
multiply them by their corresponding

1742
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:02,560
multiply them by their corresponding
 

1743
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,630
multiply them by their corresponding
weights.

1744
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:04,640
weights.
 

1745
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,710
weights.
And again, the weights are not labeled

1746
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:06,720
And again, the weights are not labeled
 

1747
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,630
And again, the weights are not labeled
the same way that you would label them

1748
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:08,640
the same way that you would label them
 

1749
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,270
the same way that you would label them
typically in uh a filtering case. In a

1750
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:11,280
typically in uh a filtering case. In a
 

1751
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,270
typically in uh a filtering case. In a
filtering case, you call this W0, this W

1752
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:15,280
filtering case, you call this W0, this W
 

1753
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,510
filtering case, you call this W0, this W
minus one or plus one, and this w + one

1754
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,520
minus one or plus one, and this w + one
 

1755
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,950
minus one or plus one, and this w + one
or minus one, depending on how you think

1756
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:18,960
or minus one, depending on how you think
 

1757
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,430
or minus one, depending on how you think
about it, which is natural because the

1758
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:21,440
about it, which is natural because the
 

1759
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,829
about it, which is natural because the
zero tells you the center. But in deep

1760
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:23,839
zero tells you the center. But in deep
 

1761
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,510
zero tells you the center. But in deep
learning, we often don't put zero at the

1762
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,520
learning, we often don't put zero at the
 

1763
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,790
learning, we often don't put zero at the
center. That doesn't mean the center

1764
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:26,800
center. That doesn't mean the center
 

1765
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,710
center. That doesn't mean the center
isn't important. It just means the

1766
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
isn't important. It just means the
 

1767
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,230
isn't important. It just means the
notation doesn't make it clear where the

1768
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,240
notation doesn't make it clear where the
 

1769
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,230
notation doesn't make it clear where the
center is.

1770
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:32,240
center is.
 

1771
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,150
center is.
Okay, you should still think about where

1772
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,160
Okay, you should still think about where
 

1773
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,430
Okay, you should still think about where
the center is. It's still very useful.

1774
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:37,440
the center is. It's still very useful.
 

1775
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,190
the center is. It's still very useful.
Okay, so in this picture, you have these

1776
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,200
Okay, so in this picture, you have these
 

1777
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,990
Okay, so in this picture, you have these
multiplications explicit and following

1778
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,000
multiplications explicit and following
 

1779
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,750
multiplications explicit and following
the same we think about linear layers.

1780
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:43,760
the same we think about linear layers.
 

1781
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,710
the same we think about linear layers.
Generally, we often have a plus where

1782
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:46,720
Generally, we often have a plus where
 

1783
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,470
Generally, we often have a plus where
you add these things together. When you

1784
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:48,480
you add these things together. When you
 

1785
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,230
you add these things together. When you
add them together, you can also add a

1786
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
add them together, you can also add a
 

1787
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,069
add them together, you can also add a
bias.

1788
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
bias.
 

1789
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,670
bias.
Okay. So

1790
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
Okay. So
 

1791
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,109
Okay. So
I want to make another note not note

1792
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:57,119
I want to make another note not note
 

1793
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,430
I want to make another note not note
here

1794
00:43:59,430 --> 00:43:59,440
here
 

1795
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,710
here
can also

1796
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:02,720

 

1797
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,630

have a bias

1798
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:06,640

 

1799
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,950

which just joins in the plus same way

1800
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:08,960
which just joins in the plus same way
 

1801
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,670
which just joins in the plus same way
you think about a linear layer.

1802
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:11,680
you think about a linear layer.
 

1803
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,470
you think about a linear layer.
Now when you want to compute Z3

1804
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:16,480
Now when you want to compute Z3
 

1805
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,270
Now when you want to compute Z3
you just shift everything down.

1806
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:19,280
you just shift everything down.
 

1807
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,710
you just shift everything down.
The same W1, W2 and W3 act and the same

1808
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:22,720
The same W1, W2 and W3 act and the same
 

1809
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,589
The same W1, W2 and W3 act and the same
bias gets added.

1810
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:25,599
bias gets added.
 

1811
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,270
bias gets added.
Okay. So

1812
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,280

 

1813
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,510

any questions on this? Is this clear to

1814
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:31,520
any questions on this? Is this clear to
 

1815
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,430
any questions on this? Is this clear to
everybody what's going on? Okay.

1816
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:33,440
everybody what's going on? Okay.
 

1817
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,270
everybody what's going on? Okay.
Hopefully everyone's seen this, but even

1818
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,280
Hopefully everyone's seen this, but even
 

1819
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,430
Hopefully everyone's seen this, but even
if you haven't, this should make it uh

1820
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:37,440
if you haven't, this should make it uh
 

1821
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,990
if you haven't, this should make it uh
clear what's happening.

1822
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:40,000
clear what's happening.
 

1823
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,510
clear what's happening.
Okay, so there's now going to be some

1824
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:43,520
Okay, so there's now going to be some
 

1825
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,390
Okay, so there's now going to be some
details that we have to go through.

1826
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:46,400
details that we have to go through.
 

1827
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,230
details that we have to go through.
So first, is the story different in two

1828
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:50,240
So first, is the story different in two
 

1829
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,069
So first, is the story different in two
dimensions? The answer is yes and no.

1830
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:54,079
dimensions? The answer is yes and no.
 

1831
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,069
dimensions? The answer is yes and no.
Right? Yes, it's different because now

1832
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:56,079
Right? Yes, it's different because now
 

1833
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,470
Right? Yes, it's different because now
you're in 2D. No, in that it's the same

1834
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,480
you're in 2D. No, in that it's the same
 

1835
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,109
you're in 2D. No, in that it's the same
exact ideas. The only difference is

1836
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:01,119
exact ideas. The only difference is
 

1837
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,790
exact ideas. The only difference is
instead of translating in one dimension,

1838
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:02,800
instead of translating in one dimension,
 

1839
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,710
instead of translating in one dimension,
you're translating in two dimensions,

1840
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
you're translating in two dimensions,
 

1841
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,309
you're translating in two dimensions,
but you still have the idea of local

1842
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:06,319
but you still have the idea of local
 

1843
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,710
but you still have the idea of local
neighborhoods. And so this is a nice

1844
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:08,720
neighborhoods. And so this is a nice
 

1845
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,109
neighborhoods. And so this is a nice
picture illustrating it. So now you have

1846
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:11,119
picture illustrating it. So now you have
 

1847
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,670
picture illustrating it. So now you have
weights, but the weights aren't arranged

1848
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:13,680
weights, but the weights aren't arranged
 

1849
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,630
weights, but the weights aren't arranged
as three numbers in a row. You have a

1850
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,640
as three numbers in a row. You have a
 

1851
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,309
as three numbers in a row. You have a
grid

1852
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:18,319
grid
 

1853
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,190
grid
where there's a center weight and corner

1854
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,200
where there's a center weight and corner
 

1855
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,670
where there's a center weight and corner
weights, and they're all different.

1856
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
weights, and they're all different.
 

1857
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,829
weights, and they're all different.
Okay? So again, you multiply the

1858
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:25,839
Okay? So again, you multiply the
 

1859
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,670
Okay? So again, you multiply the
corresponding x's in the input by these

1860
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:29,680
corresponding x's in the input by these
 

1861
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,230
corresponding x's in the input by these
weights, add them all up, including

1862
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,240
weights, add them all up, including
 

1863
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,230
weights, add them all up, including
adding in a bias, and that gives you

1864
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:34,240
adding in a bias, and that gives you
 

1865
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:41,670
adding in a bias, and that gives you
your output.

1866
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:41,680

 

1867
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,030

Okay. So now you everyone has seen and

1868
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,040
Okay. So now you everyone has seen and
 

1869
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,510
Okay. So now you everyone has seen and
should understand the basic uh operation

1870
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:47,520
should understand the basic uh operation
 

1871
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,670
should understand the basic uh operation
of a convolution in a connet.

1872
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:51,680
of a convolution in a connet.
 

1873
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,349
of a convolution in a connet.
There's isn't much more to say about

1874
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:53,359
There's isn't much more to say about
 

1875
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,190
There's isn't much more to say about
this but there are some sort of little

1876
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,200
this but there are some sort of little
 

1877
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,349
this but there are some sort of little
details. Okay. So next level of detail.

1878
00:45:59,349 --> 00:45:59,359
details. Okay. So next level of detail.
 

1879
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,470
details. Okay. So next level of detail.
What if you have more channels? We said

1880
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,480
What if you have more channels? We said
 

1881
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,470
What if you have more channels? We said
images tend to have for example they

1882
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:04,480
images tend to have for example they
 

1883
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,309
images tend to have for example they
come in with three channels red, green

1884
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:06,319
come in with three channels red, green
 

1885
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:14,470
come in with three channels red, green
and blue. So now what happens?

1886
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,480

 

1887
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,710

So now your input image has a red layer

1888
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:18,720
So now your input image has a red layer
 

1889
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,190
So now your input image has a red layer
uh sorry a red channel a green channel

1890
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:21,200
uh sorry a red channel a green channel
 

1891
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,069
uh sorry a red channel a green channel
and a blue channel. And if you want to

1892
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:24,079
and a blue channel. And if you want to
 

1893
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,349
and a blue channel. And if you want to
do the same 3x3 idea

1894
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:27,359
do the same 3x3 idea
 

1895
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,990
do the same 3x3 idea
you have nine weights associated with

1896
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,000
you have nine weights associated with
 

1897
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,670
you have nine weights associated with
it.

1898
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:31,680
it.
 

1899
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,230
it.
Because you have you do the same op you

1900
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:34,240
Because you have you do the same op you
 

1901
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,150
Because you have you do the same op you
do you do a convolution operation for

1902
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:36,160
do you do a convolution operation for
 

1903
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,630
do you do a convolution operation for
the green channel. You do a convolution

1904
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:38,640
the green channel. You do a convolution
 

1905
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,870
the green channel. You do a convolution
operation for the blue channel. You do a

1906
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:40,880
operation for the blue channel. You do a
 

1907
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,870
operation for the blue channel. You do a
convolutional operation for the red

1908
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
convolutional operation for the red
 

1909
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,829
convolutional operation for the red
channel. And then you add them all up

1910
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
channel. And then you add them all up
 

1911
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,510
channel. And then you add them all up
and that gives you one channel of the

1912
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:47,520
and that gives you one channel of the
 

1913
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,430
and that gives you one channel of the
output.

1914
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:51,440

 

1915
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,829

Okay, everyone clear with this?

1916
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:55,839
Okay, everyone clear with this?
 

1917
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,990
Okay, everyone clear with this?
Okay. So

1918
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:00,000

 

1919
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,550

what's the next case? Okay,

1920
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:04,560
what's the next case? Okay,
 

1921
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,630
what's the next case? Okay,
the next case that you can think about

1922
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
the next case that you can think about
 

1923
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:18,150
the next case that you can think about
and let me just watch the time. So

1924
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:18,160

 

1925
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,309

if

1926
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:20,319
if
 

1927
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,950
if
we want

1928
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:22,960
we want
 

1929
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:32,550
we want
more channels at the output

1930
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:32,560

 

1931
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,069

of the

1932
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:38,079

 

1933
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,630

can repeat

1934
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:42,640

 

1935
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,550

with

1936
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:44,560

1940
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:49,200

1941
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,790

and biases

1942
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:52,800

 

1943
00:47:52,800 --> 00:48:00,230

for each output channel.

1944
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:00,240

 

1945
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,349

Okay, so the input comes in in color

1946
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
Okay, so the input comes in in color
 

1947
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,670
Okay, so the input comes in in color
with three channels. There's a design

1948
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680
with three channels. There's a design
 

1949
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,309
with three channels. There's a design
choice of how many channels do you want

1950
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:08,319
choice of how many channels do you want
 

1951
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,870
choice of how many channels do you want
at the output of the first hidden layer.

1952
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
at the output of the first hidden layer.
 

1953
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,390
at the output of the first hidden layer.
This is a design parameter.

1954
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,400
This is a design parameter.
 

1955
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,030
This is a design parameter.
If you want one, that's fine. You have

1956
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,040
If you want one, that's fine. You have
 

1957
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,630
If you want one, that's fine. You have
the convolution. If you want decide to

1958
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:20,640
the convolution. If you want decide to
 

1959
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,470
the convolution. If you want decide to
go for a 3x3 convolution, then there's

1960
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:22,480
go for a 3x3 convolution, then there's
 

1961
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,309
go for a 3x3 convolution, then there's
nine weights and a bias associated with

1962
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:24,319
nine weights and a bias associated with
 

1963
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,109
nine weights and a bias associated with
it. But if you wanted there to be two,

1964
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:27,119
it. But if you wanted there to be two,
 

1965
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,349
it. But if you wanted there to be two,
there'd be nine weights and a bias for

1966
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:29,359
there'd be nine weights and a bias for
 

1967
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,349
there'd be nine weights and a bias for
one of those channels and another nine

1968
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:31,359
one of those channels and another nine
 

1969
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,589
one of those channels and another nine
weights and another bias for the second

1970
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:33,599
weights and another bias for the second
 

1971
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,950
weights and another bias for the second
channel. And if you wanted 10, there

1972
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:36,960
channel. And if you wanted 10, there
 

1973
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,750
channel. And if you wanted 10, there
would be 90 weights and 10 biases.

1974
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:43,760
would be 90 weights and 10 biases.
 

1975
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,390
would be 90 weights and 10 biases.
Everyone get it? Again, not complicated,

1976
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:46,400
Everyone get it? Again, not complicated,

Everyone get it? Again, not complicated,
but it's important to uh keep in mind

shared
across channels.

1998

1999
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,589

The only sharing that occurs is

2000
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:21,599
The only sharing that occurs is
 

2001
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,309
The only sharing that occurs is
across space.

2002
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:24,319
across space.
 

2003
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,630
across space.
Weights are shared across space because

2004
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:26,640
Weights are shared across space because
 

2005
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,630
Weights are shared across space because
the same filter is applied at different

2006
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
the same filter is applied at different
 

2007
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,190
the same filter is applied at different
spatial positions. They are not shared

2008
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:31,200
spatial positions. They are not shared
 

2009
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,589
spatial positions. They are not shared
across channels nor are they shared

2010
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:33,599
across channels nor are they shared
 

2011
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,790
across channels nor are they shared
across depth in the network.

2012
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:36,800
across depth in the network.
 

2013
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,190
across depth in the network.
Why are they not shared across channel?

2014
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:39,200
Why are they not shared across channel?
 

2015
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,549
Why are they not shared across channel?
Because the idea is that different

2016
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
Because the idea is that different
 

2017
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,030
Because the idea is that different
channels are intuitively capturing

2018
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:43,040
channels are intuitively capturing
 

2019
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,069
channels are intuitively capturing
different dimensions of information.

2020
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:46,079
different dimensions of information.
 

2021
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,790
different dimensions of information.
And so if you think for example that RGB

2022
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:48,800
And so if you think for example that RGB
 

2023
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,710
And so if you think for example that RGB
is has a lot of redundant information

2024
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:50,720
is has a lot of redundant information
 

2025
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,190
is has a lot of redundant information
across the red, the green and the blue

2026
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:53,200
across the red, the green and the blue
 

2027
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,549
across the red, the green and the blue
then you might want to change to a

2028
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:54,559
then you might want to change to a
 

2029
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,829
then you might want to change to a
different color space which has less

2030
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:57,839
different color space which has less
 

2031
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,549
different color space which has less
redundancy or you say fine I'll live

2032
00:50:00,549 --> 00:50:00,559
redundancy or you say fine I'll live
 

2033
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,230
redundancy or you say fine I'll live
with the redundancy I'll the filters

2034
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:02,240
with the redundancy I'll the filters
 

2035
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,990
with the redundancy I'll the filters
will sort it out but I want to let them

2036
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:04,000
will sort it out but I want to let them
 

2037
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,069
will sort it out but I want to let them
sort it out

2038
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:06,079
sort it out
 

2039
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,829
sort it out
but yeah you do not weight share across

2040
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:07,839
but yeah you do not weight share across
 

2041
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,510
but yeah you do not weight share across
channels you only weight share across

2042
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:09,520
channels you only weight share across
 

2043
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,990
channels you only weight share across
space because spatial uh translation

>> Yes. So if you if this is I'm talking

2060
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:30,319
>> Yes. So if you if this is I'm talking
 

2061
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,510
>> Yes. So if you if this is I'm talking
about one layer, we're talking about

2062
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:31,520
about one layer, we're talking about
 

2063
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,870
about one layer, we're talking about
depth. So we'll have many layers of

2064
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:32,880
depth. So we'll have many layers of
 

2065
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,190
depth. So we'll have many layers of
this. So the second layer, so if you

2066
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:35,200
this. So the second layer, so if you
 

2067
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,549
this. So the second layer, so if you
think of it this way, if the first layer

2068
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:36,559
think of it this way, if the first layer
 

2069
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,950
think of it this way, if the first layer
is computing edges, the second layer is

2070
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:38,960
is computing edges, the second layer is
 

2071
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,950
is computing edges, the second layer is
trying to put together, you know,

2072
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:40,960
trying to put together, you know,
 

2073
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,270
trying to put together, you know,
subfingers. The third layer is trying to

2074
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:43,280
subfingers. The third layer is trying to
 

2075
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,829
subfingers. The third layer is trying to
put together fingers. The fourth layer

2076
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:45,839
put together fingers. The fourth layer
 

2077
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,510
put together fingers. The fourth layer
is trying to put together, you know,

2078
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520
is trying to put together, you know,
 

2079
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,390
is trying to put together, you know,
hands. And the fifth layer is supposed

2080
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:50,400
hands. And the fifth layer is supposed
 

2081
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,390
hands. And the fifth layer is supposed
to put together like larger limbs. And

2082
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:54,400
to put together like larger limbs. And
 

2083
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,829
to put together like larger limbs. And
the sixth layer is supposed to put

2084
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:55,839
the sixth layer is supposed to put
 

2085
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,870
the sixth layer is supposed to put
together people. And the seventh layer

2086
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880
together people. And the seventh layer
 

2087
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,030
together people. And the seventh layer
is supposed to put together, you know,

2088
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:01,040
is supposed to put together, you know,
 

2089
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,030
is supposed to put together, you know,
small groupings of people. And the

2090
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:03,040
small groupings of people. And the
 

2091
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,390
small groupings of people. And the
eighth layer is supposed to put together

2092
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:04,400
eighth layer is supposed to put together
 

2093
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,430
eighth layer is supposed to put together
formations of people, right? And so on,

2094
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
formations of people, right? And so on,
 

2095
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,990
formations of people, right? And so on,
right? Something like this. So each of

2096
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,000
right? Something like this. So each of
 

2097
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,589
right? Something like this. So each of
them has their own at that scale object

2098
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:13,599
them has their own at that scale object
 

2099
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,990
them has their own at that scale object
that they are kind of capturing. And if

2100
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,000
that they are kind of capturing. And if
 

2101
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,309
that they are kind of capturing. And if
you want to think about the channels

2102
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:18,319
you want to think about the channels
 

2103
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,790
you want to think about the channels
intuitively, now this will break, but

2104
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:20,800
intuitively, now this will break, but
 

2105
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,390
intuitively, now this will break, but
one intuitive way to think about the

2106
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:22,400
one intuitive way to think about the
 

2107
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,470
one intuitive way to think about the
channels is to think about the channels

2108
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,480
channels is to think about the channels
 

2109
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,829
channels is to think about the channels
as being uh detectors for different

2110
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:27,839
as being uh detectors for different
 

2111
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,230
as being uh detectors for different
kinds of things.

2112
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:30,240
kinds of things.
 

2113
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,150
kinds of things.
This isn't what actually happens, but

2114
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:32,160
This isn't what actually happens, but
 

2115
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,589
This isn't what actually happens, but
it'll help you think. So think about a

2116
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:35,599
it'll help you think. So think about a
 

2117
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,270
it'll help you think. So think about a
channel and deeper in the network as

2118
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:37,280
channel and deeper in the network as
 

2119
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,309
channel and deeper in the network as
being a finger detector, a thumb

2120
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:40,319
being a finger detector, a thumb
 

2121
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,910
being a finger detector, a thumb
detector,

2122
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:41,920
detector,
 

2123
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,870
detector,
other things like this or fingers in

2124
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:44,880
other things like this or fingers in
 

2125
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,910
other things like this or fingers in
certain orientations detectors. Lots of

2126
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:47,920
certain orientations detectors. Lots of
 

2127
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,670
certain orientations detectors. Lots of
channels you can think of as having some

2128
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:49,680
channels you can think of as having some
 

2129
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,270
channels you can think of as having some
intuitive meaning like this. That's not

2130
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:51,280
intuitive meaning like this. That's not
 

2131
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,270
intuitive meaning like this. That's not
what actually happens. But it helps you

2132
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
what actually happens. But it helps you
 

2133
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,950
what actually happens. But it helps you
think about the idea of why there are

2134
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:54,960
think about the idea of why there are
 

2135
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,829
think about the idea of why there are
many of them. That's all that matters.

2136
00:51:57,829 --> 00:51:57,839
many of them. That's all that matters.
 

2137
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,750
many of them. That's all that matters.
Why there are many of them, not what

2138
00:51:59,750 --> 00:51:59,760
Why there are many of them, not what
 

2139
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,470
Why there are many of them, not what
they are. Yeah. channel or layer.

2140
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:02,480
they are. Yeah. channel or layer.
 

2141
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,030
they are. Yeah. channel or layer.
>> So this is uh the channels at a given

2142
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
>> So this is uh the channels at a given
 

2143
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,670
>> So this is uh the channels at a given
layer. So

2144
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:09,680

 

2145
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,710

can think

2146
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:12,720
can think
 

2147
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,950
can think
incorrectly

incorrectly
 

2149
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:24,230
incorrectly
or inaccurately

2150

2151
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,430

about channels

2152
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:29,440

 

2153
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:39,109

at layer L, output channels.

2154
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:39,119

 

2155
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,910

as being

2156
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:43,920

 

2157
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,349

X detectors

different X X's.
example,

2168
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:06,960
example,
 

2169
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,630
example,
fingers,

2170
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,640
fingers,
 

2171
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,630
fingers,
toes.

2172
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:12,640

 

2173
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,150

What's another finger size object?

2174
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:14,160
What's another finger size object?
 

2175
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,710
What's another finger size object?
Flies,

2176
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:16,720
Flies,
 

2177
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,270
Flies,
you know, things like that.

2178
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:19,280
you know, things like that.
 

2179
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:19,910
you know, things like that.
>> Yeah.

2180
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:19,920
>> Yeah.
 

2181
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:26,390
>> Yeah.
>> You just said that

2182
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:26,400

 

2183
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,309

for

2184
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:28,319
for
 

2185
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,430
for
everything. So why would we think of the

2186
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:31,440
everything. So why would we think of the
 

2187
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,230
everything. So why would we think of the
color in the same

2188
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:36,240

 

2189
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,870

Great question. So the question is why

2190
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:38,880
Great question. So the question is why
 

2191
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,670
Great question. So the question is why
are we think about the colors the same

2192
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:41,680
are we think about the colors the same
 

2193
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,990
are we think about the colors the same
way you think about fingers versus flies

2194
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
way you think about fingers versus flies
 

2195
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,030
way you think about fingers versus flies
versus toes? And the answer is that the

2196
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:49,040
versus toes? And the answer is that the
 

2197
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,430
versus toes? And the answer is that the
what sits inside of a channel is a real

2198
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:51,440
what sits inside of a channel is a real
 

2199
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,950
what sits inside of a channel is a real
number

2200
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:52,960
number
 

2201
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,109
number
and it's a so it's like a continuous

2202
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:57,119
and it's a so it's like a continuous
 

2203
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,910
and it's a so it's like a continuous
object. So the only things that exist at

2204
00:53:59,910 --> 00:53:59,920
object. So the only things that exist at
 

2205
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,190
object. So the only things that exist at
the pixel level raw is how much red is

2206
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:03,200
the pixel level raw is how much red is
 

2207
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,990
the pixel level raw is how much red is
there, how much green is there and how

2208
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,000
there, how much green is there and how
 

2209
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,549
there, how much green is there and how
much blue is there. That's it. That's

2210
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:08,559
much blue is there. That's it. That's
 

2211
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,150
much blue is there. That's it. That's
all the meaning that exists at the basic

2212
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:10,160
all the meaning that exists at the basic
 

2213
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,109
all the meaning that exists at the basic
lowest level. When you get at higher

2214
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
lowest level. When you get at higher
 

2215
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,950
lowest level. When you get at higher
layers of the network as you kind of

2216
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:14,960
layers of the network as you kind of
 

2217
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,390
layers of the network as you kind of
have propagated out, have looked at

2218
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:16,400
have propagated out, have looked at
 

2219
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,030
have propagated out, have looked at
neighborhoods and gone out. Now the

2220
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:19,040
neighborhoods and gone out. Now the
 

2221
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,190
neighborhoods and gone out. Now the
kinds of semantic meaning that might be

2222
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:21,200
kinds of semantic meaning that might be
 

2223
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,069
kinds of semantic meaning that might be
able to be captured there is different.

2224
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:24,079
able to be captured there is different.
 

2225
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,829
able to be captured there is different.
So here it's you can again think

2226
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:27,839
So here it's you can again think
 

2227
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,589
So here it's you can again think
inaccurately as how much fingeriness is

2228
00:54:31,589 --> 00:54:31,599
inaccurately as how much fingeriness is
 

2229
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,470
inaccurately as how much fingeriness is
here, how much towiness is here, how

2230
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,480
here, how much towiness is here, how
 

2231
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,829
here, how much towiness is here, how
much flyiness is here, things like this.

2232
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:37,839
much flyiness is here, things like this.
 

2233
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:41,030
much flyiness is here, things like this.
Again, this isn't quite right. Um in

2234
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,040
Again, this isn't quite right. Um in
 

2235
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,670
Again, this isn't quite right. Um in
fact getting something like this to

2236
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:43,680
fact getting something like this to
 

2237
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,190
fact getting something like this to
actually although this is not what

2238
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,200
actually although this is not what
 

2239
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,270
actually although this is not what
actually happens, building things that

2240
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:47,280
actually happens, building things that
 

2241
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,270
actually happens, building things that
behave more like that is a major thing

2242
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:49,280
behave more like that is a major thing
 

2243
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,710
behave more like that is a major thing
that happens in interpretability

2244
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:50,720
that happens in interpretability
 

2245
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,950
that happens in interpretability
research. people make things like what

2246
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:52,960
research. people make things like what
 

2247
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,630
research. people make things like what
are called sparse autoenccoders and the

2248
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:54,640
are called sparse autoenccoders and the
 

2249
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,270
are called sparse autoenccoders and the
like which are trying to pull out things

2250
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:57,280
like which are trying to pull out things
 

2251
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,430
like which are trying to pull out things
that are more likely to be interpretable

2252
00:54:59,430 --> 00:54:59,440
that are more likely to be interpretable
 

2253
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,349
that are more likely to be interpretable
in this way because the actual um

2254
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:03,359
in this way because the actual um
 

2255
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,829
in this way because the actual um
channels are not okay but that's

2256
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:05,839
channels are not okay but that's
 

2257
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,990
channels are not okay but that's
something that happens but this is still

2258
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:08,000
something that happens but this is still
 

2259
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,829
something that happens but this is still
a way of thinking about why you need

2260
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:09,839
a way of thinking about why you need
 

2261
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,109
a way of thinking about why you need
many of them that's all we're trying to

2262
00:55:11,109 --> 00:55:11,119
many of them that's all we're trying to
 

2263
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,950
many of them that's all we're trying to
get why you need many yeah

2264
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:12,960
get why you need many yeah
 

2265
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,190
get why you need many yeah
>> so for example in our

2266
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:17,200
>> so for example in our
 

2267
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,829
>> so for example in our
channel for our comfort layer we have

2268
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:19,839
channel for our comfort layer we have
 

2269
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:26,790
channel for our comfort layer we have
another

2271
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,710

Yes. So the answer question is if you

2272
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:28,720
Yes. So the answer question is if you
 

2273
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,870
Yes. So the answer question is if you
want this is this is one channel of the

2274
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
want this is this is one channel of the
 

2275
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,470
want this is this is one channel of the
output of the hidden layer. If you

00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:32,480
output of the hidden layer. If you
 

2277
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,710
output of the hidden layer. If you
wanted a second you'd have another copy

2278
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:34,720
wanted a second you'd have another copy
 

2279
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,270
wanted a second you'd have another copy
of of of this we still use the same

2280
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,280
of of of this we still use the same
 

2281
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,790
of of of this we still use the same
pixels but have different weights

00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:40,800
pixels but have different weights
 

2283
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,030
pixels but have different weights
associated with that second channel with

00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,040
associated with that second channel with
 

2285
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,349
associated with that second channel with
its own bias also.

Examples for X's. Yeah. So, examples
 

2299
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,470
Examples for X's. Yeah. So, examples
for X,

>> That's a great question. Um the answer
 

2323
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,190
>> That's a great question. Um the answer
is uh so the question is how do you know

2324
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:31,200
is uh so the question is how do you know
 

2325
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,870
is uh so the question is how do you know
that the different channels during

2326
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:32,880
that the different channels during
 

2327
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,349
that the different channels during
training will actually specialize in

2328
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:35,359
training will actually specialize in
 

2329
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,589
training will actually specialize in
doing different things

2330
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:37,599
doing different things
 

2331
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,109
doing different things
actually have different things. So

2332
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:39,119
actually have different things. So
 

2333
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,549
actually have different things. So
there's a couple of things that are the

2334
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
there's a couple of things that are the
 

2335
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:41,829
there's a couple of things that are the
ways that happens. First is you

2336
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:41,839
ways that happens. First is you
 

2337
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,150
ways that happens. First is you
initialize randomly so they're not all

2338
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,160
initialize randomly so they're not all
 

2339
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,069
initialize randomly so they're not all
initialized to the same thing. That

2340
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,079
initialized to the same thing. That
 

2341
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,430
initialized to the same thing. That
gives you a chance of learning something

2342
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:47,440
gives you a chance of learning something
 

2343
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,630
gives you a chance of learning something
different. The second is you hope that

2344
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:50,640
different. The second is you hope that
 

2345
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,150
different. The second is you hope that
it is useful to learn different things.

2346
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:54,160
it is useful to learn different things.
 

2347
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,829
it is useful to learn different things.
There's gradient descent that's trying

2348
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:55,839
There's gradient descent that's trying
 

2349
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,510
There's gradient descent that's trying
to make the loss go down and so it'll

2350
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:57,520
to make the loss go down and so it'll
 

2351
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,270
to make the loss go down and so it'll
try to do useful things but there's a

2352
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,280
try to do useful things but there's a
 

2353
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,670
try to do useful things but there's a
leap of faith there. And the third thing

2354
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:01,680
leap of faith there. And the third thing
 

2355
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,910
leap of faith there. And the third thing
is that

2356
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:03,920
is that
 

2357
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,829
is that
in reality they do learn redundant

2358
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:05,839
in reality they do learn redundant
 

2359
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,069
in reality they do learn redundant
things and then the question becomes is

2360
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:08,079
things and then the question becomes is
 

2361
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,870
things and then the question becomes is
that a feature or a bug to which the

2362
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:10,880
that a feature or a bug to which the
 

2363
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,030
that a feature or a bug to which the
answer is much more nuanced which we'll

2364
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,040
answer is much more nuanced which we'll
 

2365
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,589
answer is much more nuanced which we'll
come to uh later.

2366
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:17,599

 

2367
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,190

If they were to initialize the same,

2368
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:19,200
If they were to initialize the same,
 

2369
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,750
If they were to initialize the same,
would you expect them to still I guess

2370
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:21,760
would you expect them to still I guess
 

2371
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,270
would you expect them to still I guess
we might see like leap of faith that

2372
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,280
we might see like leap of faith that
 

2373
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,950
we might see like leap of faith that
still sort of separates out.

2374
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:24,960
still sort of separates out.
 

2375
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,710
still sort of separates out.

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,230
the same, unless there's something
different later that will break the

2380
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
different later that will break the
 

2381
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,030
different later that will break the
symmetry. If there if you initialize

2382
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,040
symmetry. If there if you initialize
 

2383
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,109
symmetry. If there if you initialize
everything at every layer the same,

2384
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:35,119
everything at every layer the same,
 

2385
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,430
everything at every layer the same,
nothing they would do nothing to break

2386
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:37,440
nothing they would do nothing to break
 

2387
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,710
nothing they would do nothing to break
that symmetry.

2388
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:38,720
that symmetry.
 

2389
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,710
that symmetry.
>> Um so you have to break the symmetry

2390
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
>> Um so you have to break the symmetry
 

2391
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,309
>> Um so you have to break the symmetry
somehow.

2392
00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:42,319
somehow.
 

2393
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,150
somehow.
Um and random initialization is one way

2394
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:44,160
Um and random initialization is one way
 

2395
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,710
Um and random initialization is one way
that we break the symmetry in training.

2396
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,720
that we break the symmetry in training.
 

2397
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,309
that we break the symmetry in training.
Um, yeah.

2398
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:48,319
Um, yeah.
 

2399
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,309
Um, yeah.
>> Would you ever want to have weights that

2400
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:50,319
>> Would you ever want to have weights that
 

2401
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,630
>> Would you ever want to have weights that
only act on like certain input channels?

2402
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:52,640
only act on like certain input channels?
 

2403
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,390
only act on like certain input channels?
Like so instead of going like if you

2404
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:54,400
Like so instead of going like if you
 

2405
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,910
Like so instead of going like if you
have like you know 32 input channels

2406
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:55,920
have like you know 32 input channels
 

2407
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,829
have like you know 32 input channels
like oh I only want this image to act on

2408
00:57:57,829 --> 00:57:57,839
like oh I only want this image to act on
 

2409
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,670
like oh I only want this image to act on
like 10 of them or something.

2410
00:57:59,670 --> 00:57:59,680
like 10 of them or something.
 

2411
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,349
like 10 of them or something.
>> Yeah. So the question was do you ever

2412
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:01,359
>> Yeah. So the question was do you ever
 

2413
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,910
>> Yeah. So the question was do you ever
have weight matrices that only look at a

2414
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:03,920
have weight matrices that only look at a
 

2415
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,349
have weight matrices that only look at a
subset of channels? The answer is yes.

2416
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:05,359
subset of channels? The answer is yes.
 

2417
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,589
subset of channels? The answer is yes.
We'll talk about that later.

2418
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:07,599
We'll talk about that later.
 

2419
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:22,069
We'll talk about that later.
>> Yeah.

2420
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079

 

2421
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,390

Oh, sure. Sure. What is this picture

2422
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:24,400
Oh, sure. Sure. What is this picture
 

2423
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,430
Oh, sure. Sure. What is this picture
illustrating? This uh let me just use

2424
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,440
illustrating? This uh let me just use
 

2425
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,430
illustrating? This uh let me just use
this.

2426
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,440
this.
 

2427
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,230
this.
This block of nine weights is supposed

2428
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:32,240
This block of nine weights is supposed
 

2429
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,270
This block of nine weights is supposed
to be nine distinct weights.

2430
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:35,280
to be nine distinct weights.
 

2431
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,910
to be nine distinct weights.
They have colors chosen randomly for

2432
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:37,920
They have colors chosen randomly for
 

2433
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,750
They have colors chosen randomly for
visual aesthetics. They don't mean

2434
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:39,760
visual aesthetics. They don't mean
 

2435
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,349
visual aesthetics. They don't mean
anything. This mean they're nine

2436
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:41,359
anything. This mean they're nine
 

2437
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,789
anything. This mean they're nine
different things.

2438
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:42,799
different things.
 

2439
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,870
different things.
>> The nine different things multiplied the

2440
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:44,880
>> The nine different things multiplied the
 

2441
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,910
>> The nine different things multiplied the
corresponding nine different things here

2442
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:47,920
corresponding nine different things here
 

2443
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,109
corresponding nine different things here
and then it's like a inner product.

2444
00:58:51,109 --> 00:58:51,119
and then it's like a inner product.
 

2445
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,430
and then it's like a inner product.
>> Okay. Yeah, I thought

2446
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:53,440
>> Okay. Yeah, I thought
 

2447
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,750
>> Okay. Yeah, I thought
>> yeah has no meaning. Just a straight uh

2448
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:55,760
>> yeah has no meaning. Just a straight uh
 

2449
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,470
>> yeah has no meaning. Just a straight uh
inner product. Um and the colors here

2450
00:58:58,470 --> 00:58:58,480
inner product. Um and the colors here
 

2451
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,069
inner product. Um and the colors here
just reflect what channel they came

2452
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:00,079
just reflect what channel they came
 

2453
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,750
just reflect what channel they came
from.

2454
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:01,760
from.
 

2455
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,950
from.
That's all I'm trying to be illustrated

2456
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
That's all I'm trying to be illustrated
 

2457
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,030
That's all I'm trying to be illustrated
here. Um yeah, last question. Yeah.

2458
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:07,040
here. Um yeah, last question. Yeah.
 

2459
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:12,150
here. Um yeah, last question. Yeah.
>> So you said that um

2460
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:12,160

 

2461
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,230

You're talking about

2462
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:14,240
You're talking about
 

2463
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,430
You're talking about
layer you can have multiple channels.

2464
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:17,440
layer you can have multiple channels.
 

2465
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:17,990
layer you can have multiple channels.
>> Yes.

2466
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:18,000
>> Yes.
 

2467
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,750
>> Yes.
>> But I'm seeing this picture that you've

2468
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:19,760
>> But I'm seeing this picture that you've
 

2469
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,109
>> But I'm seeing this picture that you've
taken all three channels

2470
00:59:23,109 --> 00:59:23,119
taken all three channels
 

2471
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:31,270
taken all three channels
and you're getting

2472
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:31,280

 

2473
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,470

>> sure let me just do it. Okay. Um let's

2474
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:34,480
>> sure let me just do it. Okay. Um let's
 

2475
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:58,470
>> sure let me just do it. Okay. Um let's
see if we can do this on the fly.

2476
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:58,480

 

2477
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:06,230

Okay, let me see if this works.

2478
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:06,240

 

2479
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,150

Come on. Ah, didn't work. Okay, I don't

2480
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:10,160
Come on. Ah, didn't work. Okay, I don't
 

2481
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,390
Come on. Ah, didn't work. Okay, I don't
know how to do this. How to select a

2482
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:12,400
know how to do this. How to select a
 

2483
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,710
know how to do this. How to select a
particular piece of this. Uh, I'll just

2484
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:14,720
particular piece of this. Uh, I'll just
 

2485
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,430
particular piece of this. Uh, I'll just
draw it. Okay.

2486
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:19,440

 

2487
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:25,750

Free form select might work.

2488
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:25,760

 

2489
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,270

>> H, too much trouble.

2490
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:27,280
>> H, too much trouble.
 

2491
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,870
>> H, too much trouble.
>> Okay, I'll just draw it.

2492
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:28,880
>> Okay, I'll just draw it.
 

2493
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,670
>> Okay, I'll just draw it.
>> Thank you.

2494
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:29,680
>> Thank you.
 

2495
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,230
>> Thank you.
>> Okay,

2496
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:34,240

 

2497
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:41,670

here's my bad version of

2498
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:41,680

 

2499
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,789

this box. Okay, another one.

2500
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:46,799
this box. Okay, another one.
 

2501
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:55,750
this box. Okay, another one.
Okay.

2502
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:55,760

 

2503
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,349

Okay.

2504
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:57,359
Okay.
 

2505
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:04,390
Okay.
And here's

2506
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:04,400

 

2507
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,309

Okay. That's another one of these

2508
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:06,319
Okay. That's another one of these
 

2509
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:10,630
Okay. That's another one of these
outputs. Another channel.

2510
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:10,640

 

2511
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,870

>> Each of these cubes have different

2512
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:12,880
>> Each of these cubes have different
 

2513
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,670
>> Each of these cubes have different
weights.

2514
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:13,680
weights.
 

2515
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,190
weights.
>> Yes.

2516
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,200
>> Yes.
 

2517
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,750
>> Yes.
So if you want more channels, you just

2518
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:17,760
So if you want more channels, you just
 

2519
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,190
So if you want more channels, you just
repeat. You do this again with different

2520
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:21,200
repeat. You do this again with different
 

2521
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,109
repeat. You do this again with different
weights and different biases and you get

2522
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:23,119
weights and different biases and you get
 

2523
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,309
weights and different biases and you get
different outputs from the same input.

2524
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:26,319
different outputs from the same input.
 

2525
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:27,910
different outputs from the same input.
So you just keep stacking up. That's

2526
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:27,920
So you just keep stacking up. That's
 

2527
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,589
So you just keep stacking up. That's
actually a point that I wanted to what

2528
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:29,599
actually a point that I wanted to what
 

2529
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,190
actually a point that I wanted to what
makes it clearest. We can just do it

2530
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
makes it clearest. We can just do it
 

2531
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,349
makes it clearest. We can just do it
again to

2532
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:33,359
again to
 

2533
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:38,549
again to
special case that's useful.

2534
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:38,559

 

2535
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,950

Okay.

2536
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:40,960
Okay.
 

2537
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:47,670
Okay.
Is a one by one convolution.

2538
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:47,680

 

2539
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,030

Okay. So, what's a one by one conve? A

2540
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:51,040
Okay. So, what's a one by one conve? A
 

2541
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:56,230
Okay. So, what's a one by one conve? A
one by one convey

2542
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:56,240

 

2543
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,549

this pixel. I'm not going to look at

2544
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:58,559
this pixel. I'm not going to look at
 

2545
01:01:58,559 --> 01:01:59,750
this pixel. I'm not going to look at
neighboring pixels. I'm just look at

2546
01:01:59,750 --> 01:01:59,760
neighboring pixels. I'm just look at
 

2547
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,230
neighboring pixels. I'm just look at
this pixel. So, if you think of it from

2548
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:02,240
this pixel. So, if you think of it from
 

2549
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,750
this pixel. So, if you think of it from
the perspective of just straight

2550
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:03,760
the perspective of just straight
 

2551
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,990
the perspective of just straight
convolution,

2552
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,000
convolution,
 

2553
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,510
convolution,
you might think, well, that's silly.

2554
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:07,520
you might think, well, that's silly.
 

2555
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,309
you might think, well, that's silly.
That's just multiplying by a constant,

2556
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:10,319
That's just multiplying by a constant,
 

2557
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,270
That's just multiplying by a constant,
right? But when you think about many

2558
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:13,280
right? But when you think about many
 

2559
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,309
right? But when you think about many
channels, it's not silly because a one

2560
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:16,319
channels, it's not silly because a one
 

2561
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,270
channels, it's not silly because a one
by one con, what what's a one by one con

2562
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,280
by one con, what what's a one by one con
 

2563
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,870
by one con, what what's a one by one con
do? a one by one conf

2564
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:22,880
do? a one by one conf
 

2565
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,630
do? a one by one conf
with

2566
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:24,640
with
 

2567
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:32,470
with
C in input channels. C input

2568
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:32,480

 

2569
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,549

channels

2570
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:36,559

 

2571
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,670

and C output

2572
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:39,680
and C output
 

2573
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,349
and C output
channels.

2574
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:43,359

 

2575
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,870

So everyone understand what I mean? It's

2576
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:44,880
So everyone understand what I mean? It's
 

2577
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,710
So everyone understand what I mean? It's
a conveyor. It's not going to look at

2578
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:46,720
a conveyor. It's not going to look at
 

2579
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,549
a conveyor. It's not going to look at
neighbors, but it's going to have the

2580
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:48,559
neighbors, but it's going to have the
 

2581
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,309
neighbors, but it's going to have the
input to it has C in channels and the

2582
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:50,319
input to it has C in channels and the
 

2583
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,870
input to it has C in channels and the
output has C out channels.

2584
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:52,880
output has C out channels.
 

2585
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,910
output has C out channels.
So, what does that look like? So, the

2586
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:55,920
So, what does that look like? So, the
 

2587
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,430
So, what does that look like? So, the
input

2588
01:02:59,430 --> 01:02:59,440

 

2589
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:07,430

from one pixel

2590
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:07,440

 

2591
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,470

is a vector.

2592
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,480

 

2593
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,190

Call it X.

2594
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:15,200
Call it X.
 

2595
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,109
Call it X.
The output. What is the size of X?

2596
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:19,119
The output. What is the size of X?
 

2597
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,349
The output. What is the size of X?
CN.

2598
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:21,359
CN.
 

2599
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:29,829
CN.
The output

2600
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:29,839

 

2601
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,510

for

2602
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:31,520
for
 

2603
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,910
for
this pixel.

2604
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:33,920
this pixel.
 

2605
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,150
this pixel.
Remember the output for a conair is

2606
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:36,160
Remember the output for a conair is
 

2607
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,190
Remember the output for a conair is
always for this pixel. The next pixel

2608
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
always for this pixel. The next pixel
 

2609
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,710
always for this pixel. The next pixel
you have to shift everything. So the

2610
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:40,720
you have to shift everything. So the
 

2611
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,470
you have to shift everything. So the
output is always for this pixel. The

2612
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:42,480
output is always for this pixel. The
 

2613
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,230
output is always for this pixel. The
input depending on the size could be

2614
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:44,240
input depending on the size could be
 

2615
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,710
input depending on the size could be
many pixels.

2616
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:46,720
many pixels.
 

2617
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,390
many pixels.
The output for this pixel is also a

2618
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:48,400
The output for this pixel is also a
 

2619
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:58,390
The output for this pixel is also a
vector

2620
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:58,400

 

2621
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,430

and they are related linearly.

2622
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
and they are related linearly.
 

2623
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,750
and they are related linearly.
Okay. So what is the rule?

2624
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:05,760
Okay. So what is the rule?
 

2625
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,270
Okay. So what is the rule?
Y

2626
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:07,280
Y
 

2627
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,829
Y
is a weight matrix acting on X.

2628
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:11,839
is a weight matrix acting on X.
 

2629
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:14,470
is a weight matrix acting on X.
What is the shape of this weight matrix?

2630
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:14,480
What is the shape of this weight matrix?
 

2631
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,270
What is the shape of this weight matrix?
C in

2632
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:17,280
C in
 

2633
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,430
C in
C out

2634
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
C out
 

2635
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,829
C out
plus biases. Well, how many biases? C

2636
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:23,839
plus biases. Well, how many biases? C
 

2637
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,630
plus biases. Well, how many biases? C
out.

2638
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:26,640
out.
 

2639
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,150
out.
So a one by one con is another word for

2640
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:30,160
So a one by one con is another word for
 

2641
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,470
So a one by one con is another word for
a pixel specific linear layer. Dense

2642
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:32,480
a pixel specific linear layer. Dense
 

2643
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,670
a pixel specific linear layer. Dense
linear layer. Does everyone see that?

2644
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:35,680
linear layer. Does everyone see that?
 

2645
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,390
linear layer. Does everyone see that?
That's what dense linear layer did.

2646
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:38,400
That's what dense linear layer did.
 

2647
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,029
That's what dense linear layer did.
And so

2648
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:41,039
And so
 

2649
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,349
And so
a one by one conf is a good way to help

2650
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:43,359
a one by one conf is a good way to help
 

2651
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,349
a one by one conf is a good way to help
if you can understand a one by one con

2652
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:45,359
if you can understand a one by one con
 

2653
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,430
if you can understand a one by one con
and you can understand the rest and then

2654
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:47,440
and you can understand the rest and then
 

2655
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,789
and you can understand the rest and then
you can understand that these have to be

2656
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:48,799
you can understand that these have to be
 

2657
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,630
you can understand that these have to be
compatible that will give you the

2658
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:50,640
compatible that will give you the
 

2659
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,190
compatible that will give you the
general story in your mind. So it's

2660
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,200
general story in your mind. So it's
 

2661
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,390
general story in your mind. So it's
useful to think about the special case

2662
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:54,400
useful to think about the special case
 

2663
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,829
useful to think about the special case
of one by one con. They're also useful

2664
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:55,839
of one by one con. They're also useful
 

2665
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:59,270
of one by one con. They're also useful
in practice.

2666
01:04:59,270 --> 01:04:59,280

 

2667
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,910

Okay. So if you think about the uh one

2668
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:03,920
Okay. So if you think about the uh one
 

2669
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,430
Okay. So if you think about the uh one
by one case we can remember

2670
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:07,440
by one case we can remember
 

2671
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,470
by one case we can remember
we can also

2672
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:10,480
we can also
 

2673
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:17,430
we can also
have a nonlinearity.

2674
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:17,440

 

2675
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,950

We don't have to have one. We can also

2676
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
We don't have to have one. We can also
 

2677
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,430
We don't have to have one. We can also
have a linear conveys have a nonlinear

2678
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:21,440
have a linear conveys have a nonlinear
 

2679
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,910
have a linear conveys have a nonlinear
conlair. So would a nonlinear conve

2680
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:23,920
conlair. So would a nonlinear conve
 

2681
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:30,630
conlair. So would a nonlinear conve
again for our one by one example

2682
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:30,640

 

2683
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,870

the output could be for example

2684
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:34,880
the output could be for example
 

2685
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:42,309
the output could be for example
relu

2686
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:42,319

 

2687
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:45,270

where the nonlinearity unless we specify

2688
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:45,280
where the nonlinearity unless we specify
 

2689
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,750
where the nonlinearity unless we specify
otherwise acts uh component by

2690
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:47,760
otherwise acts uh component by
 

2691
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:54,069
otherwise acts uh component by
component.

2692
01:05:54,069 --> 01:05:54,079

 

2693
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:55,670

So this is a one by one con with a

2694
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,680
So this is a one by one con with a
 

2695
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,190
So this is a one by one con with a
nonlinearity. But if you didn't want a

2696
01:05:59,190 --> 01:05:59,200
nonlinearity. But if you didn't want a
 

2697
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,150
nonlinearity. But if you didn't want a
one by one con and you wanted a 3x3 conf

2698
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
one by one con and you wanted a 3x3 conf
 

2699
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,470
one by one con and you wanted a 3x3 conf
for example, what happens from math

2700
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:04,480
for example, what happens from math
 

2701
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,710
for example, what happens from math
point of view? What happens from a math

2702
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:06,720
point of view? What happens from a math
 

2703
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,510
point of view? What happens from a math
point of view for a 3x3 conf is you will

2704
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:09,520
point of view for a 3x3 conf is you will
 

2705
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,670
point of view for a 3x3 conf is you will
still have biases that are the same size

2706
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:11,680
still have biases that are the same size
 

2707
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,470
still have biases that are the same size
as the output channels.

2708
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:14,480
as the output channels.
 

2709
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,510
as the output channels.
Your W will just, if you want to think

2710
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:17,520
Your W will just, if you want to think
 

2711
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,270
Your W will just, if you want to think
about it, get a whole bunch more columns

2712
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:19,280
about it, get a whole bunch more columns
 

2713
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,589
about it, get a whole bunch more columns
in it because your X will have the

2714
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:21,599
in it because your X will have the
 

2715
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,589
in it because your X will have the
values for this pixel, but also the

2716
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:25,599
values for this pixel, but also the
 

2717
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,029
values for this pixel, but also the
values for all the neighboring pixels

2718
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:27,039
values for all the neighboring pixels
 

2719
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:28,950
values for all the neighboring pixels
that are relevant all stacked up if you

2720
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:28,960
that are relevant all stacked up if you
 

2721
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,950
that are relevant all stacked up if you
want to think of it as unrolling it into

2722
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:30,960
want to think of it as unrolling it into
 

2723
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,549
want to think of it as unrolling it into
a 2x2 a standard matrix.

2724
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:36,559
a 2x2 a standard matrix.
 

2725
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,190
a 2x2 a standard matrix.
Okay.

2726
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,200
Okay.
 

2727
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,109
Okay.
Okay. So, this is where I want to make a

2728
01:06:41,109 --> 01:06:41,119
Okay. So, this is where I want to make a
 

2729
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,109
Okay. So, this is where I want to make a
comment.

2730
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:43,119
comment.
 

2731
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:45,670
comment.
This perspective of thinking about a one

2732
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:45,680
This perspective of thinking about a one
 

2733
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,789
This perspective of thinking about a one
by one con and then thinking about non

2734
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:48,799
by one con and then thinking about non
 

2735
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:53,190
by one con and then thinking about non
one by one cons as though they were in

2736
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:53,200
one by one cons as though they were in
 

2737
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,910
one by one cons as though they were in
the same shape is what helps you in many

2738
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:57,920
the same shape is what helps you in many
 

2739
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,589
the same shape is what helps you in many
implementations

2740
01:06:59,589 --> 01:06:59,599
implementations
 

2741
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,750
implementations
take ideas like mup and the like and

2742
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:03,760
take ideas like mup and the like and
 

2743
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,910
take ideas like mup and the like and
apply them to the context of convents

2744
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:07,920
apply them to the context of convents
 

2745
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,430
apply them to the context of convents
because we've learned everything there

2746
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:09,440
because we've learned everything there
 

2747
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,589
because we've learned everything there
in the context of matrices. So if you

2748
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:11,599
in the context of matrices. So if you
 

2749
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,470
in the context of matrices. So if you
think about RMS norms for example, you

2750
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:14,480
think about RMS norms for example, you
 

2751
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,789
think about RMS norms for example, you
can think about the RMS norms at every

2752
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:16,799
can think about the RMS norms at every
 

2753
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,789
can think about the RMS norms at every
pixel because the image is filled with

2754
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:18,799
pixel because the image is filled with
 

2755
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:20,710
pixel because the image is filled with
pixels.

2756
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:20,720
pixels.
 

2757
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,349
pixels.
And then you can say one approach is to

2758
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:23,359
And then you can say one approach is to
 

2759
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:26,230
And then you can say one approach is to
say if I want to maintain constant RMS

2760
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:26,240
say if I want to maintain constant RMS
 

2761
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,789
say if I want to maintain constant RMS
norms then I want to make sure this

2762
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:28,799
norms then I want to make sure this
 

2763
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,109
norms then I want to make sure this
weight matrix is the right way and this

2764
01:07:31,109 --> 01:07:31,119
weight matrix is the right way and this
 

2765
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,630
weight matrix is the right way and this
biases are the right way all that kind

2766
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,640
biases are the right way all that kind
 

2767
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,870
biases are the right way all that kind
of stuff.

2768
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:34,880
of stuff.
 

2769
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,430
of stuff.
Okay. So this if I if I make my con

2770
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:37,440
Okay. So this if I if I make my con
 

2771
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,829
Okay. So this if I if I make my con
bigger my D in from the perspective of

2772
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:41,839
bigger my D in from the perspective of
 

2773
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:47,029
bigger my D in from the perspective of
MUP or muon changes for this weights.

2774
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:47,039
MUP or muon changes for this weights.
 

2775
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,630
MUP or muon changes for this weights.
Okay, so that's another reason to think

2776
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:48,640
Okay, so that's another reason to think
 

2777
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,670
Okay, so that's another reason to think
about one by one cons. And in fact, um I

2778
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:51,680
about one by one cons. And in fact, um I
 

2779
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,109
about one by one cons. And in fact, um I
believe many of the practical

2780
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:53,119
believe many of the practical
 

2781
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:55,670
believe many of the practical
implementations of muon for connets do

2782
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:55,680
implementations of muon for connets do
 

2783
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,630
implementations of muon for connets do
exactly this. They will take the weight

2784
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:58,640
exactly this. They will take the weight
 

2785
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,710
exactly this. They will take the weight
the weights for a con layer and

2786
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
the weights for a con layer and
 

2787
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,349
the weights for a con layer and
effectively

2788
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:03,359
effectively
 

2789
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:07,109
effectively
map them into a regular size matrix with

2790
01:08:07,109 --> 01:08:07,119
map them into a regular size matrix with
 

2791
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,270
map them into a regular size matrix with
the input being

2792
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:09,280
the input being
 

2793
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,750
the input being
uh all the different channels at all the

2794
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:11,760
uh all the different channels at all the
 

2795
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,069
uh all the different channels at all the
pixels that are relevant and the output

2796
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:14,079
pixels that are relevant and the output
 

2797
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:16,870
pixels that are relevant and the output
being the all of the channels at this

2798
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
being the all of the channels at this
 

2799
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,390
being the all of the channels at this
particular layer. Okay, so this is the

2800
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:20,400
particular layer. Okay, so this is the
 

2801
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,550
particular layer. Okay, so this is the
correction for how to connect the ideas

2802
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:22,560
correction for how to connect the ideas
 

2803
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,510
correction for how to connect the ideas
together. Any

2804
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:25,520
together. Any
 

2805
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,749
together. Any
questions on the one by one case and how

2806
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:27,759
questions on the one by one case and how
 

2807
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,590
questions on the one by one case and how
to think about now you have to work it

2808
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:29,600
to think about now you have to work it
 

2809
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,510
to think about now you have to work it
out yourself you know on paper and

2810
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:31,520
out yourself you know on paper and
 

2811
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,189
out yourself you know on paper and
there's like we'll give you homework

2812
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:33,199
there's like we'll give you homework
 

2813
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:35,110
there's like we'll give you homework
that has you count things and stuff like

2814
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:35,120
that has you count things and stuff like
 

2815
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,829
that has you count things and stuff like
that you just get used to it

2816
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:37,839
that you just get used to it
 

2817
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,149
that you just get used to it
the actual shape of these objects is

2818
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:40,159
the actual shape of these objects is
 

2819
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:42,550
the actual shape of these objects is
important and the weight matrices aren't

2820
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:42,560
important and the weight matrices aren't
 

2821
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,870
important and the weight matrices aren't
matrices actually in terms of how

2822
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:44,880
matrices actually in terms of how
 

2823
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,110
matrices actually in terms of how
they're stored in con layers they're

2824
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:47,120
they're stored in con layers they're
 

2825
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,189
they're stored in con layers they're
stored as tensors with different sizes

2826
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:49,199
stored as tensors with different sizes
 

2827
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:51,829
stored as tensors with different sizes
associated with them

2828
01:08:51,829 --> 01:08:51,839
associated with them
 

2829
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:56,229
associated with them
but that's for implementation reasons

2830
01:08:56,229 --> 01:08:56,239

 

2831
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:57,829

Okay.

2832
01:08:57,829 --> 01:08:57,839
Okay.
 

2833
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:00,709
Okay.
So, good. Everyone is clear on this. So,

2834
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:00,719
So, good. Everyone is clear on this. So,
 

2835
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:05,430
So, good. Everyone is clear on this. So,
now we can come back up here

2836
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:05,440
now we can come back up here
 

2837
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:09,110
now we can come back up here
to this picture here.

2838
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:09,120
to this picture here.
 

2839
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,829
to this picture here.
So, this picture brings up a a very

2840
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:11,839
So, this picture brings up a a very
 

2841
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,829
So, this picture brings up a a very
interesting question is that this

2842
01:09:13,829 --> 01:09:13,839
interesting question is that this
 

2843
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,950
interesting question is that this
picture started with Z2

2844
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:16,960
picture started with Z2
 

2845
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,950
picture started with Z2
purposefully. It didn't start with Z1.

2846
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:20,960
purposefully. It didn't start with Z1.
 

2847
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,510
purposefully. It didn't start with Z1.
Okay. So can anyone tell me right now

2848
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
Okay. So can anyone tell me right now
 

2849
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,030
Okay. So can anyone tell me right now
why do you think this picture started

2850
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:25,040
why do you think this picture started
 

2851
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,590
why do you think this picture started
with Z2 and not Z1 when you talked about

2852
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:27,600
with Z2 and not Z1 when you talked about
 

2853
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,030
with Z2 and not Z1 when you talked about
the basics of a cond?

2854
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:31,040
the basics of a cond?
 

2855
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,309
the basics of a cond?
>> Um yeah

2856
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:32,319
>> Um yeah
 

2857
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:35,189
>> Um yeah
>> you need to pat it to use Z1.

2858
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:35,199
>> you need to pat it to use Z1.
 

2859
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:36,709
>> you need to pat it to use Z1.
>> So you said you need to pat it which is

2860
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:36,719
>> So you said you need to pat it which is
 

2861
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,630
>> So you said you need to pat it which is
a word right? Um that's true. Um

2862
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:40,640
a word right? Um that's true. Um
 

2863
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,269
a word right? Um that's true. Um
but at a picture level can you just tell

2864
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:43,279
but at a picture level can you just tell
 

2865
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,910
but at a picture level can you just tell
me at a picture level what happens? You

2866
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
me at a picture level what happens? You
 

2867
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,070
me at a picture level what happens? You
need the three input values to get a Z

2868
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,080
need the three input values to get a Z
 

2869
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,030
need the three input values to get a Z
value and there's no corresponding X for

2870
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:51,040
value and there's no corresponding X for
 

2871
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,110
value and there's no corresponding X for
Z1.

2872
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:53,120
Z1.
 

2873
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,270
Z1.
>> Yeah, you kind of float off, right? So

2874
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,280
>> Yeah, you kind of float off, right? So
 

2875
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,790
>> Yeah, you kind of float off, right? So
if you think about it as you just run

2876
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:56,800
if you think about it as you just run
 

2877
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,590
if you think about it as you just run
the code, it tries to index this array

2878
01:09:59,590 --> 01:09:59,600
the code, it tries to index this array
 

2879
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,510
the code, it tries to index this array
at a place the there's nothing valid.

2880
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:01,520
at a place the there's nothing valid.
 

2881
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,790
at a place the there's nothing valid.
You invalid memory access error, right?

2882
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:04,800
You invalid memory access error, right?
 

2883
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,550
You invalid memory access error, right?
Like what are you going to look at? Does

2884
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:06,560
Like what are you going to look at? Does
 

2885
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,590
Like what are you going to look at? Does
everyone see that? There's like a

2886
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:07,600
everyone see that? There's like a
 

2887
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,550
everyone see that? There's like a
question of what do you do on the

2888
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:08,560
question of what do you do on the
 

2889
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,070
question of what do you do on the
boundaries? So this is the question of

2890
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:10,080
boundaries? So this is the question of
 

2891
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,669
boundaries? So this is the question of
padding. So we need to talk about

2892
01:10:11,669 --> 01:10:11,679
padding. So we need to talk about
 

2893
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,390
padding. So we need to talk about
padding.

2894
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:14,400
padding.
 

2895
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:18,470
padding.
So let's move down.

2896
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:18,480

 

2897
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,470

Okay.

2898
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:22,480

 

2899
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,229

So this is a picture again just taking

2900
01:10:24,229 --> 01:10:24,239
So this is a picture again just taking
 

2901
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:25,669
So this is a picture again just taking
it from you can understand the idea of

2902
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:25,679
it from you can understand the idea of
 

2903
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,149
it from you can understand the idea of
padding easier in the case of 1D because

2904
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
padding easier in the case of 1D because
 

2905
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,189
padding easier in the case of 1D because
it's easier to think but the same thing

2906
01:10:29,189 --> 01:10:29,199
it's easier to think but the same thing
 

2907
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,270
it's easier to think but the same thing
applies in 2D.

2908
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:31,280
applies in 2D.
 

2909
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,470
applies in 2D.
There's a problem of what to do at the

2910
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:32,480
There's a problem of what to do at the
 

2911
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,550
There's a problem of what to do at the
boundaries. So if your filter wants

2912
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:34,560
boundaries. So if your filter wants
 

2913
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,189
boundaries. So if your filter wants
three inputs at the very beginning it

2914
01:10:37,189 --> 01:10:37,199
three inputs at the very beginning it
 

2915
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,350
three inputs at the very beginning it
doesn't have three.

2916
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:39,360
doesn't have three.
 

2917
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,830
doesn't have three.
It only has two. What are you going to

2918
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:41,840
It only has two. What are you going to
 

2919
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:48,950
It only has two. What are you going to
do for the third is the question. And

2920
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:48,960

 

2921
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,590

one choice, the choice illustrated in

2922
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:51,600
one choice, the choice illustrated in
 

2923
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,870
one choice, the choice illustrated in
this picture is called zero padding,

2924
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:54,880
this picture is called zero padding,
 

2925
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,229
this picture is called zero padding,
which is that when you don't have an

2926
01:10:56,229 --> 01:10:56,239
which is that when you don't have an
 

2927
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,550
which is that when you don't have an
input, but you want one, you just say

2928
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,560
input, but you want one, you just say
 

2929
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,550
input, but you want one, you just say
it's zero. Everyone see? Okay. So you

2930
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:02,560
it's zero. Everyone see? Okay. So you
 

2931
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,830
it's zero. Everyone see? Okay. So you
can think of it as you literally take

2932
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:03,840
can think of it as you literally take
 

2933
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,669
can think of it as you literally take
the input, you expand it by adding zeros

2934
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:07,679
the input, you expand it by adding zeros
 

2935
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,149
the input, you expand it by adding zeros
to the boundaries and then you only do

2936
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:12,159
to the boundaries and then you only do
 

2937
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:15,830
to the boundaries and then you only do
the filter in the places where it fits.

2938
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:15,840
the filter in the places where it fits.
 

2939
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,030
the filter in the places where it fits.
Okay, that's another way of thinking

2940
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:17,040
Okay, that's another way of thinking
 

2941
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,070
Okay, that's another way of thinking
about it.

2942
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:20,080
about it.
 

2943
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,030
about it.
And if you chose not to pad, then what

2944
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:23,040
And if you chose not to pad, then what
 

2945
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,709
And if you chose not to pad, then what
happens is you simply do not calculate

2946
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:24,719
happens is you simply do not calculate
 

2947
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,229
happens is you simply do not calculate
for any of those inputs that are

2948
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:26,239
for any of those inputs that are
 

2949
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:27,910
for any of those inputs that are
invalid.

2950
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:27,920
invalid.
 

2951
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,070
invalid.
So you start here with no padding.

2952
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:32,080
So you start here with no padding.
 

2953
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,790
So you start here with no padding.
Does everyone see that? So that's also a

2954
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:34,800
Does everyone see that? So that's also a
 

2955
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,470
Does everyone see that? So that's also a
choice. Just only do the ones that fit.

2956
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:38,480
choice. Just only do the ones that fit.
 

2957
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,430
choice. Just only do the ones that fit.
So there's another name for the special

2958
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:41,440
So there's another name for the special
 

2959
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,950
So there's another name for the special
case of when you pad such that the

2960
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:44,960
case of when you pad such that the
 

2961
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,630
case of when you pad such that the
output is the same size as the input.

2962
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:48,640
output is the same size as the input.
 

2963
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,229
output is the same size as the input.
So there's always a choice of padding

2964
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:50,239
So there's always a choice of padding
 

2965
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,030
So there's always a choice of padding
that'll let you do that. That's called

2966
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:53,040
that'll let you do that. That's called
 

2967
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,310
that'll let you do that. That's called
same padding

2968
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,320
same padding
 

2969
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,070
same padding
because this

2970
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:58,080
because this
 

2971
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,510
because this
just you know you want the same size

2972
01:11:59,510 --> 01:11:59,520
just you know you want the same size
 

2973
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,430
just you know you want the same size
output image as the input image.

2974
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:03,440
output image as the input image.
 

2975
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,430
output image as the input image.
Okay.

2976
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:05,440
Okay.
 

2977
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,390
Okay.
So this is the basics of uh padding. But

2978
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:08,400
So this is the basics of uh padding. But
 

2979
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,709
So this is the basics of uh padding. But
I wanted to take this uh moment and

2980
01:12:10,709 --> 01:12:10,719
I wanted to take this uh moment and
 

2981
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:14,950
I wanted to take this uh moment and
maybe give everyone uh

2982
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:14,960
maybe give everyone uh
 

2983
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,950
maybe give everyone uh
this is set the timer if Okay, I'm going

2984
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:18,960
this is set the timer if Okay, I'm going
 

2985
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,149
this is set the timer if Okay, I'm going
to give everyone one minute.

2986
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:22,159
to give everyone one minute.
 

2987
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:24,149
to give everyone one minute.
Talk with your neighbors and see if you

2988
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:24,159
Talk with your neighbors and see if you
 

2989
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:27,270
Talk with your neighbors and see if you
can come up with any other ways to pad

2990
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:27,280
can come up with any other ways to pad
 

2991
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,189
can come up with any other ways to pad
than this.

2992
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:29,199
than this.
 

2993
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,030
than this.
Okay, this way of padding is you put

2994
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:31,040
Okay, this way of padding is you put
 

2995
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:36,709
Okay, this way of padding is you put
zeros. Are there any other choices?

2996
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719

 

2997
01:12:36,719 --> 01:13:01,430

So go ahead and thick talk.

2998
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:01,440

 

2999
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,430

But if it works,

3000
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,440
But if it works,
 

3001
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:35,510
But if it works,
>> I don't know about

3002
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:35,520

 

3003
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,030

Okay.

3004
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:37,040
Okay.
 

3005
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,270
Okay.
>> Timer ran out.

3006
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:39,280
>> Timer ran out.
 

3007
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,910
>> Timer ran out.
>> Um, anyone want to raise your hand and

3008
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
>> Um, anyone want to raise your hand and
 

3009
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,229
>> Um, anyone want to raise your hand and
suggest uh something that you came up

3010
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:44,239
suggest uh something that you came up
 

3011
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,950
suggest uh something that you came up
with that wasn't zero?

3012
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:46,960
with that wasn't zero?
 

3013
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,910
with that wasn't zero?
>> Yeah.

3014
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:47,920
>> Yeah.
 

3015
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,030
>> Yeah.
>> Wrap around. Maybe

3016
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,040
>> Wrap around. Maybe
 

3017
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,950
>> Wrap around. Maybe
>> wrap around. Yeah, you can wrap around

3018
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:50,960
>> wrap around. Yeah, you can wrap around
 

3019
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,270
>> wrap around. Yeah, you can wrap around

01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:13,030

Okay. So uh in the context of images for

3032
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,040
Okay. So uh in the context of images for
 

3033
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,950
Okay. So uh in the context of images for
example uh can anyone say what might be

3034
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:16,960
example uh can anyone say what might be
 

3035
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,390
example uh can anyone say what might be
a problem with doing zero padding or

3036
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,400
a problem with doing zero padding or
 

3037
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,189
a problem with doing zero padding or
wraparound padding from the perspective

3038
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:23,199
wraparound padding from the perspective
 

3039
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:28,390
wraparound padding from the perspective
of what a small filter might experience.

01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:28,400

 

3041
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,149

Yeah.

3042
01:14:30,149 --> 01:14:30,159
Yeah.
 

3043
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,390
Yeah.
Go ahead. Yeah. Back there. Yeah. Yeah.

Go ahead. Yeah. Back there. Yeah. Yeah.
 

3045
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,910
Go ahead. Yeah. Back there. Yeah. Yeah.

I guess I'll detect that as an edge
just like a big shiny.

01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,070
semantically semantically meaningless.
So either way there's an issue with

01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,080
So either way there's an issue with
 

3091
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,510
So either way there's an issue with
sharp discontinuities that may or may

sharp discontinuities that may or may
 

3093
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,070
sharp discontinuities that may or may
not come up. Great. Um, so wraparound

3094
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:28,080
not come up. Great. Um, so wraparound
 

3095
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,510
not come up. Great. Um, so wraparound
padding and zero padding both suffer

3096
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:29,520
padding and zero padding both suffer
 

3097
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,189
padding and zero padding both suffer
from sharp discontinuities. Can anyone

3098
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:31,199
from sharp discontinuities. Can anyone
 

3099
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,270
from sharp discontinuities. Can anyone
give me another padding? Can it come

3100
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
give me another padding? Can it come
 

3101
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,630
give me another padding? Can it come
with that padding that doesn't have the

3102
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:34,640
with that padding that doesn't have the
 

3103
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:42,630
with that padding that doesn't have the

3104
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:42,640

 

3105

01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:50,149

01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,669

But the question is how exactly do you

But the question is how exactly do you
 

3111
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,630
But the question is how exactly do you
copy? So, you have choices. You can copy

3117
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,990

you have 3x3 filter which one do you
 

3119
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,790
you have 3x3 filter which one do you
copy right so but that there's different

kinds of copying um another version of

01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:07,760
kinds of copying um another version of
 

3123
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,350
kinds of copying um another version of
copying for a larger for a 7 by seven

3127
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,310
filter let's say you have to copy out
significantly past the boundary so what

3128
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:16,320
significantly past the boundary so what
 

3129
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,870
significantly past the boundary so what
do you copy there

3130
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:18,880
do you copy there
 

3131
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,709
do you copy there
you can keep copying but again you'll

you can keep copying but again you'll
 

3133
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,709
you can keep copying but again you'll
have the same discontinuity issue so

3134
01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:22,719
have the same discontinuity issue so
 

3135
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:24,310
have the same discontinuity issue so
what's another kind of generic approach

3136

what's another kind of generic approach
 

3137
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,990
what's another kind of generic approach
one could do

3138
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,000
one could do
 

3139
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,510
one could do

3145
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:33,750
>> Yeah, you could put average. You could
put averages there. So that a kind of

3146
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:33,760
put averages there. So that a kind of
 

3147
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,390
put averages there. So that a kind of
Yeah, you could do averages.

3148
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:36,400
Yeah, you could do averages.
 

3149

anyone has seen how JPEG works, you

3153
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:43,830
anyone has seen how JPEG works, you

might have seen this other approach that
 

3155
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,669
might have seen this other approach that
is also possible. Yeah,

3156
01:16:45,669 --> 01:16:45,679
is also possible. Yeah,
 

3157
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:47,189
is also possible. Yeah,
>> you do reflection.

It's called mirror padding.

3162
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:57,040

 

3163
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,110

So if you do a mirror padding then what

3164
01:16:59,110 --> 01:16:59,120
So if you do a mirror padding then what
 

3165
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,270
So if you do a mirror padding then what
happens is you sometimes get less of

3166
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:01,280
happens is you sometimes get less of
 

3167
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,070
happens is you sometimes get less of
this discontinuity effect just just

3168
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
this discontinuity effect just just
 

3169
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,630
this discontinuity effect just just
mirrors over so at least it's smooth

3170
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:06,640
mirrors over so at least it's smooth
 

3171
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:07,590
mirrors over so at least it's smooth
right you still have might have a

3172
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:07,600
right you still have might have a
 

3173
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,669
right you still have might have a
discontinuity at the derivative but not

3174
01:17:09,669 --> 01:17:09,679
discontinuity at the derivative but not
 

3175
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,470
discontinuity at the derivative but not
at the level itself and so these are all

3176
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:12,480
at the level itself and so these are all
 

3177
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,030
at the level itself and so these are all
different choices however practically

3178
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:15,040
different choices however practically
 

3179
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,790
different choices however practically
speaking it's important to recognize

3180
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:16,800
speaking it's important to recognize
 

3181
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,790
speaking it's important to recognize
that the one that most people do because

3182
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:18,800
that the one that most people do because
 

3183
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,630
that the one that most people do because
of the ease of implementation and the

3184
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640
of the ease of implementation and the
 

3185
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,790
of the ease of implementation and the
fact that it tends to just work is just

3186
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:22,800
fact that it tends to just work is just
 

3187
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,669
fact that it tends to just work is just
zero

3188
01:17:23,669 --> 01:17:23,679
zero
 

3189
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,590
zero
But you should know these others exist.

3190
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:27,600
But you should know these others exist.
 

3191
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,669
But you should know these others exist.
Okay.

3192
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:29,679
Okay.
 

3193
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,189
Okay.
So this is padding. Uh this lets you

3194
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:33,199
So this is padding. Uh this lets you
 

3195
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:36,709
So this is padding. Uh this lets you
deal with different uh shapes. So now

3196
01:17:36,709 --> 01:17:36,719
deal with different uh shapes. So now
 

3197
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,870
deal with different uh shapes. So now
there's

3198
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:38,880
there's
 

3199
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,709
there's
that's all I want to say about padding.

3200
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:40,719
that's all I want to say about padding.
 

3201
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:41,990
that's all I want to say about padding.
There's another term that we should

3202
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:42,000
There's another term that we should
 

3203
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,510
There's another term that we should
learn. It's just called receptive

3204
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:43,520
learn. It's just called receptive
 

3205
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,110
learn. It's just called receptive
fields. As we make a network deeper,

3206
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,120
fields. As we make a network deeper,
 

3207
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,110
fields. As we make a network deeper,
what happens? So what is this? This is

3208
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:47,120
what happens? So what is this? This is
 

3209
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,870
what happens? So what is this? This is
again a figure from Prince.

3210
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:50,880
again a figure from Prince.
 

3211
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,830
again a figure from Prince.
So you can always ask the question

3212
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:53,840
So you can always ask the question
 

3213
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,149
So you can always ask the question
depending on which layer you are in the

3214
01:17:56,149 --> 01:17:56,159
depending on which layer you are in the
 

3215
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:57,750
depending on which layer you are in the
network

3216
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:57,760
network
 

3217
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,950
network
how many things does this depend on.

3218
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:00,960
how many things does this depend on.
 

3219
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,470
how many things does this depend on.
Okay so this comes out this is a term

3220
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:02,480
Okay so this comes out this is a term
 

3221
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,830
Okay so this comes out this is a term
that came out of biology originally and

3222
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:05,840
that came out of biology originally and
 

3223
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,510
that came out of biology originally and
so it says at hidden layer 1 if I'm

3224
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:07,520
so it says at hidden layer 1 if I'm
 

3225
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:14,470
so it says at hidden layer 1 if I'm
doing a 3x3 conveime

3226
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480

 

3227
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,030

you have these channels here as the

3228
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:17,040
you have these channels here as the
 

3229
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,790
you have these channels here as the
output of the hidden layer. What do they

3230
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:18,800
output of the hidden layer. What do they
 

3231
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,470
output of the hidden layer. What do they
depend on? Well, they depend on these

3232
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:20,480
depend on? Well, they depend on these
 

3233
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:24,149
depend on? Well, they depend on these
three pixels in the input.

3234
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:24,159
three pixels in the input.
 

3235
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,630
three pixels in the input.
Okay. Now, suppose there was another

3236
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:26,640
Okay. Now, suppose there was another
 

3237
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,510
Okay. Now, suppose there was another
filter afterward that looked at three of

3238
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:29,520
filter afterward that looked at three of
 

3239
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,430
filter afterward that looked at three of
these

3240
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:31,440
these
 

3241
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,350
these
at the at the second hidden layer. Does

3242
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:33,360
at the at the second hidden layer. Does
 

3243
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,030
at the at the second hidden layer. Does
everyone understand the picture? This is

3244
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:35,040
everyone understand the picture? This is
 

3245
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,790
everyone understand the picture? This is
hidden layer one, hidden layer two. Now,

3246
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:38,800
hidden layer one, hidden layer two. Now,
 

3247
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,630
hidden layer one, hidden layer two. Now,
I point to one of these and I say, how

3248
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:40,640
I point to one of these and I say, how
 

3249
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,310
I point to one of these and I say, how
much of the input does this depend on?

3250
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:44,320
much of the input does this depend on?
 

3251
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,510
much of the input does this depend on?
Well, these all depend on these guys and

3252
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:47,520
Well, these all depend on these guys and
 

3253
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,390
Well, these all depend on these guys and
these depend on this. So, it just grows

3254
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:50,400
these depend on this. So, it just grows
 

3255
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,669
these depend on this. So, it just grows
up out by one for threes. Does everyone

3256
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:53,679
up out by one for threes. Does everyone
 

3257
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:56,229
up out by one for threes. Does everyone
see that?

3258
01:18:56,229 --> 01:18:56,239
see that?
 

3259
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:57,830
see that?
Okay.

3260
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:57,840
Okay.
 

3261
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,990
Okay.
So, now

3262
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:00,000
So, now
 

3263
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,510
So, now
the question I want to ask is suppose

3264
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:03,520
the question I want to ask is suppose
 

3265
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,510
the question I want to ask is suppose
all of the filters in your connet are

3266
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,520
all of the filters in your connet are
 

3267
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,189
all of the filters in your connet are
3x3. This is your 3x3 case. So I have

3268
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:11,199
3x3. This is your 3x3 case. So I have
 

3269
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:14,229
3x3. This is your 3x3 case. So I have
layers upon layers of con filters and I

3270
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:14,239
layers upon layers of con filters and I
 

3271
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:16,870
layers upon layers of con filters and I
go to layer L.

3272
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:16,880
go to layer L.
 

3273
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,310
go to layer L.
How big in order sense is the receptive

3274
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:20,320
How big in order sense is the receptive
 

3275
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,950
How big in order sense is the receptive
field going to be?

3276
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:22,960
field going to be?
 

3277
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,950
field going to be?
How many pixels at the input will depend

3278
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
How many pixels at the input will depend
 

3279
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,630
How many pixels at the input will depend
will will this depend on this single

3280
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:26,640
will will this depend on this single
 

3281
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,189
will will this depend on this single
pixel at layer L. Do you understand the

3282
01:19:29,189 --> 01:19:29,199
pixel at layer L. Do you understand the
 

3283
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:36,390
pixel at layer L. Do you understand the
question? question.

3284
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:36,400

 

3285
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,990

Suppose

3286
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:40,000

 

3287
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,189

all cons

3288
01:19:43,189 --> 01:19:43,199
all cons
 

3289
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:47,189
all cons
are 3x3 or just 1D

3290
01:19:47,189 --> 01:19:47,199
are 3x3 or just 1D
 

3291
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:55,350
are 3x3 or just 1D
or in 1D

3292

receptive field?
 

3303
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,110
receptive field?
Okay, does everyone understand the

3304
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:11,120
Okay, does everyone understand the
 

3305
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,189
Okay, does everyone understand the
question first?

3306
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:13,199
question first?
 

3307
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,870
question first?
Okay, we're kind of what this question

3308
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:14,880
Okay, we're kind of what this question
 

3309
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,149
Okay, we're kind of what this question
is getting at is how fast is information

3310
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:18,159
is getting at is how fast is information
 

3311
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,950
is getting at is how fast is information
being collected from the entire image as

3312
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:20,960
being collected from the entire image as
 

3313
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,189
being collected from the entire image as
we're going doing the processing.

3314
01:20:23,189 --> 01:20:23,199
we're going doing the processing.
 

3315
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:24,229
we're going doing the processing.
That's the question we want to

3316
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:24,239
That's the question we want to
 

3317
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:25,830
That's the question we want to
understand.

3318
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:25,840
understand.
 

3319
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:31,590
understand.
So, anyone want to tell me the answer?

3320
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:31,600

 

3321
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,750

Just look at this picture. What if I did

3322
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:33,760
Just look at this picture. What if I did
 

3323
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,709
Just look at this picture. What if I did
this again? One more time. How big would

3324
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:36,719
this again? One more time. How big would
 

3325
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:43,189
this again? One more time. How big would
the thing get?

3326
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:43,199

 

3327
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:48,470

>> Right. Just shout it out someone.

3328
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:48,480

 

3329
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:51,350

>> So you're looking at 2 L + one.

3330
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:51,360
>> So you're looking at 2 L + one.
 

3331
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,510
>> So you're looking at 2 L + one.
>> Yeah.

3332
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:53,520
>> Yeah.
 

3333
01:20:53,520 --> 01:21:03,830
>> Yeah.
Okay.

3334
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:03,840

 

3335
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,990

Right? You're growing by one. The

3336
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:06,000
Right? You're growing by one. The
 

3337
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,669
Right? You're growing by one. The
important thing here is that this is

3338
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:07,679
important thing here is that this is
 

3339
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:10,630
important thing here is that this is
linear growth.

3340
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:10,640
linear growth.
 

3341
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,910
linear growth.
So sometimes what you want to have in a

3342
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:13,920
So sometimes what you want to have in a
 

3343
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,390
So sometimes what you want to have in a
continent is you would like to have

3344
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:16,400
continent is you would like to have
 

3345
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,430
continent is you would like to have
information from further away get here

3346
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:19,440
information from further away get here
 

3347
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,950
information from further away get here
faster.

3348
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:20,960
faster.
 

3349
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,870
faster.
You want to have more information come

3350
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:22,880
You want to have more information come
 

3351
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,709
You want to have more information come
together. Does everyone see why that

3352
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:24,719
together. Does everyone see why that
 

3353
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:27,990
together. Does everyone see why that
might be desirable? Um,

3354
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:28,000
might be desirable? Um,
 

3355
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,270
might be desirable? Um,
it's when you want to have when you

3356
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:29,280
it's when you want to have when you
 

3357
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,830
it's when you want to have when you
think that the you're using a small

3358
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:31,840
think that the you're using a small
 

3359
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,830
think that the you're using a small
conf, but you think the objects you're

3360
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:33,840
conf, but you think the objects you're
 

3361
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:34,870
conf, but you think the objects you're
interested are actually getting bigger

3362
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:34,880
interested are actually getting bigger
 

3363
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,070
interested are actually getting bigger
at this layer. There aren't really

3364
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,080
at this layer. There aren't really
 

3365
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,870
at this layer. There aren't really
objects with very intermediate sizes.

3366
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:38,880
objects with very intermediate sizes.
 

3367
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,189
objects with very intermediate sizes.
So, how can you how can you get uh the

3368
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:43,199
So, how can you how can you get uh the
 

3369
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:47,590
So, how can you how can you get uh the
receptive field to grow faster?

3370
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:47,600
receptive field to grow faster?
 

3371
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,709
receptive field to grow faster?
And this is again a an old idea from

3372
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:50,719
And this is again a an old idea from
 

3373
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,790
And this is again a an old idea from
signal processing which is that if you

3374
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
signal processing which is that if you
 

3375
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,070
signal processing which is that if you
would like to have the receptive field

3376
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:56,080
would like to have the receptive field
 

3377
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,270
would like to have the receptive field
get faster larger you can say is you

3378
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
get faster larger you can say is you
 

3379
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,310
get faster larger you can say is you
could down sample the image.

3380
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:02,320
could down sample the image.
 

3381
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,870
could down sample the image.
So because a 3x3 con on an image that's

3382
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:04,880
So because a 3x3 con on an image that's
 

3383
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,270
So because a 3x3 con on an image that's
half by half size actually goes out much

3384
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:07,280
half by half size actually goes out much
 

3385
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,830
half by half size actually goes out much
further in terms of the actual spatial

3386
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:09,840
further in terms of the actual spatial
 

3387
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,189
further in terms of the actual spatial
extent of the original image. Does

3388
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:11,199
extent of the original image. Does
 

3389
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:13,590
extent of the original image. Does
everyone see the intuition behind that?

3390
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:13,600
everyone see the intuition behind that?
 

3391
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,390
everyone see the intuition behind that?
A small box on a smaller image is a

3392
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:16,400
A small box on a smaller image is a
 

3393
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,510
A small box on a smaller image is a
bigger box when you scale it up.

3394
01:22:19,510 --> 01:22:19,520
bigger box when you scale it up.
 

3395
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,110
bigger box when you scale it up.
So this is the idea of downsampling.

3396
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:21,120
So this is the idea of downsampling.
 

3397
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,790
So this is the idea of downsampling.
It's a very important part of

3398
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:22,800
It's a very important part of
 

3399
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,270
It's a very important part of
continents.

3400
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:25,280
continents.
 

3401
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,350
continents.
And so

3402
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:27,360
And so
 

3403
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,790
And so
one way you can do down sampling is

3404
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:30,800
one way you can do down sampling is
 

3405
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:34,070
one way you can do down sampling is
what's called stride.

3406
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:34,080
what's called stride.
 

3407
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,950
what's called stride.
So you can think of stride as actually

3408
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:36,960
So you can think of stride as actually
 

3409
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,030
So you can think of stride as actually
being the composition of two things

3410
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:39,040
being the composition of two things
 

3411
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,390
being the composition of two things
which is why I really like this figure

3412
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:40,400
which is why I really like this figure
 

3413
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,310
which is why I really like this figure
in Prince

3414
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:42,320
in Prince
 

3415
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,990
in Prince
because it shows you downsampling in

3416
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:44,000
because it shows you downsampling in
 

3417
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,790
because it shows you downsampling in
this way. It says

3418
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:46,800
this way. It says
 

3419
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,470
this way. It says
you could imagine something that

3420
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:48,480
you could imagine something that
 

3421
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:52,149
you could imagine something that
actually had a circle here, a circle

3422
01:22:52,149 --> 01:22:52,159
actually had a circle here, a circle
 

3423
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:54,550
actually had a circle here, a circle
here, a circle here, and a circle here.

3424
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:54,560
here, a circle here, and a circle here.
 

3425
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,189
here, a circle here, and a circle here.
All these other circles, but you throw

3426
01:22:57,189 --> 01:22:57,199
All these other circles, but you throw
 

3427
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,830
All these other circles, but you throw
half the circles away. Easiest way to

3428
01:22:59,830 --> 01:22:59,840
half the circles away. Easiest way to
 

3429
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,189
half the circles away. Easiest way to
down sample is just throw half the

3430
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
down sample is just throw half the
 

3431
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,750
down sample is just throw half the
things away or to subsample at a certain

3432
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:03,760
things away or to subsample at a certain
 

3433
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,310
things away or to subsample at a certain
rate. Everyone see that? Like if you

3434
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:06,320
rate. Everyone see that? Like if you
 

3435
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,149
rate. Everyone see that? Like if you
want to take a high-res picture and make

3436
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:08,159
want to take a high-res picture and make
 

3437
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:09,669
want to take a high-res picture and make
it a low res picture, the simplest thing

3438
01:23:09,669 --> 01:23:09,679
it a low res picture, the simplest thing
 

3439
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:11,590
it a low res picture, the simplest thing
you can do is literally throw away a

3440
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:11,600
you can do is literally throw away a
 

3441
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,270
you can do is literally throw away a
whole bunch of pixels.

3442
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:15,280

 

3443
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,550

So computationally, you might think

3444
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:18,560
So computationally, you might think
 

3445
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,229
So computationally, you might think
computing a bunch of things that you're

3446
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:20,239
computing a bunch of things that you're
 

3447
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:22,870
computing a bunch of things that you're
going to throw away is not a smart idea.

3448
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:22,880
going to throw away is not a smart idea.
 

3449
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,870
going to throw away is not a smart idea.
Everyone with me?

3450
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:24,880
Everyone with me?
 

3451
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,350
Everyone with me?
Okay. So

3452
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:27,360
Okay. So
 

3453
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,030
Okay. So
the combination

3454
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:29,040
the combination
 

3455
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,550
the combination
of the two steps of doing a filter and

3456
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:32,560
of the two steps of doing a filter and
 

3457
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,430
of the two steps of doing a filter and
throwing stuff away in an efficient

3458
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:35,440
throwing stuff away in an efficient
 

3459
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,629
throwing stuff away in an efficient
manner is called stride.

3460
01:23:38,629 --> 01:23:38,639
manner is called stride.
 

3461
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,110
manner is called stride.
It just says take this thing but instead

3462
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:41,120
It just says take this thing but instead
 

3463
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,709
It just says take this thing but instead
of moving it by one, move it by two.

3464
01:23:44,709 --> 01:23:44,719
of moving it by one, move it by two.
 

3465
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,070
of moving it by one, move it by two.
That's stride too. Okay, moving it by

3466
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:48,080
That's stride too. Okay, moving it by
 

3467
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,229
That's stride too. Okay, moving it by
two means throwing every other thing

3468
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:50,239
two means throwing every other thing
 

3469
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:53,830
two means throwing every other thing
away. Moving it by three means throwing

3470
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:53,840
away. Moving it by three means throwing
 

3471
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,830
away. Moving it by three means throwing
every

3472
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:55,840
every
 

3473
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,910
every
two out of three away.

3474
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:57,920
two out of three away.
 

3475
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,110
two out of three away.
Okay, everyone see the picture? Okay,

3476
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:01,120
Okay, everyone see the picture? Okay,
 

3477
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,950
Okay, everyone see the picture? Okay,
that's called uh stride.

3478
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:04,960
that's called uh stride.
 

3479
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,550
that's called uh stride.
Again, basic stuff, but everyone has to

3480
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:06,560
Again, basic stuff, but everyone has to
 

3481
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,030
Again, basic stuff, but everyone has to
know it. And going back to the original

3482
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:09,040
know it. And going back to the original
 

3483
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,550
know it. And going back to the original
picture, this is a fully connected

3484
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:10,560
picture, this is a fully connected
 

3485
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,629
picture, this is a fully connected
network. And here's a con uh with size

3486
01:24:14,629 --> 01:24:14,639
network. And here's a con uh with size
 

3487
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,430
network. And here's a con uh with size
three as a bunch of weights. If I have a

3488
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:17,440
three as a bunch of weights. If I have a
 

3489
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:22,149
three as a bunch of weights. If I have a
con of size three with a stride,

3490
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:22,159
con of size three with a stride,
 

3491
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,790
con of size three with a stride,
it looks like this. So instead of having

3492
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
it looks like this. So instead of having
 

3493
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,110
it looks like this. So instead of having
six outputs, I only have three outputs.

3494
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:27,120
six outputs, I only have three outputs.
 

3495
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:32,550
six outputs, I only have three outputs.
And they look like this.

3496
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:32,560

 

3497
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,790

Okay, good.

3498
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:36,800

 

3499
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,709

So you can see that if you have uh

3500
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:38,719
So you can see that if you have uh
 

3501
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:42,149
So you can see that if you have uh
stride you get this growth faster

3502
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:42,159
stride you get this growth faster
 

3503
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:45,590
stride you get this growth faster
of receptive field. Okay, I think I am

3504
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:45,600
of receptive field. Okay, I think I am
 

3505
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,750
of receptive field. Okay, I think I am
out of time now. I went slower than I

3506
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:47,760
out of time now. I went slower than I
 

3507
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,350
out of time now. I went slower than I
wanted. It's fine. I have another

3508
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:49,360
wanted. It's fine. I have another
 

3509
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,110
wanted. It's fine. I have another
lecture before the discussion. So it's

3510
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:51,120
lecture before the discussion. So it's
 

3511
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,229
lecture before the discussion. So it's
good. Um so I have office hours now. Uh

3512
01:24:54,229 --> 01:24:54,239
good. Um so I have office hours now. Uh
 

3513
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:57,510
good. Um so I have office hours now. Uh
we will we hope to in the next two

3514
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:57,520
we will we hope to in the next two
 

3515
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,910
we will we hope to in the next two
lectures we want to finish up connetss

3516
01:24:59,910 --> 01:24:59,920
lectures we want to finish up connetss
 

3517
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,390
lectures we want to finish up connetss
uh the connet story get the basics then

3518
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:02,400
uh the connet story get the basics then
 

3519
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,629
uh the connet story get the basics then
we'll move on to uh graph neural nets.

3520
01:25:04,629 --> 01:25:04,639
we'll move on to uh graph neural nets.
 

3521
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:07,639
we'll move on to uh graph neural nets.
Okay.
