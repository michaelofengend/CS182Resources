00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:02,720
recovering material more or less in a
 

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,710
recovering material more or less in a
style similar to what's going on in

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:04,720
style similar to what's going on in
 

5
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,790
style similar to what's going on in
prints. And uh another reminder for

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:08,800
prints. And uh another reminder for
 

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,430
prints. And uh another reminder for
people is that we have TA office hours

8
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
people is that we have TA office hours
 

9
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,549
people is that we have TA office hours
today. Uh so the TAs told us that uh

10
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:14,559
today. Uh so the TAs told us that uh
 

11
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,230
today. Uh so the TAs told us that uh
last week the attendance at the office

12
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
last week the attendance at the office
 

13
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,790
last week the attendance at the office
hours was extremely sparse to the point

14
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:18,800
hours was extremely sparse to the point
 

15
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,189
hours was extremely sparse to the point
of some of them having zero. So if we're

16
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:21,199
of some of them having zero. So if we're
 

17
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,189
of some of them having zero. So if we're
not going to you know if people want TA

18
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
not going to you know if people want TA
 

19
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,109
not going to you know if people want TA
office hours, you know, you should go to

20
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
office hours, you know, you should go to
 

21
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,750
office hours, you know, you should go to
TA office hours. If we think see things

22
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
TA office hours. If we think see things
 

23
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,349
TA office hours. If we think see things
being attended at level zero, then we'll

24
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
being attended at level zero, then we'll
 

25
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,509
being attended at level zero, then we'll
like divert those resources elsewhere.

26
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
like divert those resources elsewhere.
 

27
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,790
like divert those resources elsewhere.
Um, so we we've heard people's requests

28
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
Um, so we we've heard people's requests
 

29
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,750
Um, so we we've heard people's requests
of uh possibly trying to have uh an

30
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:37,760
of uh possibly trying to have uh an
 

31
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,430
of uh possibly trying to have uh an
office hour on Friday. We're looking

32
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
office hour on Friday. We're looking
 

33
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,350
office hour on Friday. We're looking
into it. We're seeing if we can possibly

34
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,360
into it. We're seeing if we can possibly
 

35
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,790
into it. We're seeing if we can possibly
do it, but you should come to office

36
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:42,800
do it, but you should come to office
 

37
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,709
do it, but you should come to office
hours today if you have uh questions.

38
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
hours today if you have uh questions.
 

39
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,670
hours today if you have uh questions.
Remember the solutions are in scope from

40
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:47,680
Remember the solutions are in scope from
 

41
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,950
Remember the solutions are in scope from
last week. The homework that is

42
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
last week. The homework that is
 

43
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,229
last week. The homework that is
currently happening this week is in

44
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
currently happening this week is in
 

45
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,510
currently happening this week is in
scope. So you know take advantage of it

46
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
scope. So you know take advantage of it
 

47
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,590
scope. So you know take advantage of it
to understand.

48
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
to understand.
 

49
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,029
to understand.
Also want to remind people about

50
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039
Also want to remind people about
 

51
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,029
Also want to remind people about
discussion. Discussion tomorrow will go

52
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
discussion. Discussion tomorrow will go
 

53
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,790
discussion. Discussion tomorrow will go
through and work you through lots of the

54
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
through and work you through lots of the
 

55
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,430
through and work you through lots of the
basics of uh CNN's. It's good to

56
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
basics of uh CNN's. It's good to
 

57
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,109
basics of uh CNN's. It's good to
solidify your information. There's also

58
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
solidify your information. There's also
 

59
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,469
solidify your information. There's also
be also going to be a component that'll

60
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
be also going to be a component that'll
 

61
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,469
be also going to be a component that'll
be a notebook. So bring your computers.

62
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
be a notebook. So bring your computers.
 

63
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,910
be a notebook. So bring your computers.
Uh that should hopefully also make

64
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:11,920
Uh that should hopefully also make
 

65
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,190
Uh that should hopefully also make
things a lot lot clearer for you. Okay.

66
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
things a lot lot clearer for you. Okay.
 

67
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,310
things a lot lot clearer for you. Okay.
So that's it for announcements. I'm

68
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
So that's it for announcements. I'm
 

69
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,870
So that's it for announcements. I'm
going to start uh into the material. So

70
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
going to start uh into the material. So
 

71
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,590
going to start uh into the material. So
we talked about CNN's, we talked about

72
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
we talked about CNN's, we talked about
 

73
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,590
we talked about CNN's, we talked about
how they apply to vision problems, we

74
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
how they apply to vision problems, we
 

75
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,990
how they apply to vision problems, we
applied how we talked about how we have

76
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
applied how we talked about how we have
 

77
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,749
applied how we talked about how we have
certain key ideas we want to build. So

78
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
certain key ideas we want to build. So
 

79
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,590
certain key ideas we want to build. So
what I want to do now is to talk a

80
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
what I want to do now is to talk a
 

81
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,510
what I want to do now is to talk a
little bit more about conlares in light

82
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
little bit more about conlares in light
 

83
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,789
little bit more about conlares in light
of some of the questions that we were

84
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
of some of the questions that we were
 

85
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,109
of some of the questions that we were
getting. So uh recall the basic picture

86
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119
getting. So uh recall the basic picture
 

87
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,270
getting. So uh recall the basic picture
of what's happening in a con. You saw

88
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
of what's happening in a con. You saw
 

89
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,910
of what's happening in a con. You saw
that before. We think about the input.

90
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
that before. We think about the input.
 

91
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,190
that before. We think about the input.
This is a 1D case. you have a sliding

92
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
This is a 1D case. you have a sliding
 

93
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,950
This is a 1D case. you have a sliding
window across the inputs and very

94
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
window across the inputs and very
 

95
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,630
window across the inputs and very
important in convolutions is that the

96
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
important in convolutions is that the
 

97
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,710
important in convolutions is that the
topology of the input matters. The fact

98
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
topology of the input matters. The fact
 

99
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,350
topology of the input matters. The fact
that you have an image or a line

100
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
that you have an image or a line
 

101
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,830
that you have an image or a line
matters. You have local neighborhoods.

102
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
matters. You have local neighborhoods.
 

103
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,230
matters. You have local neighborhoods.
The local neighborhoods for example are

104
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
The local neighborhoods for example are
 

105
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,030
The local neighborhoods for example are
three things. So that's this guy and

106
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
three things. So that's this guy and
 

107
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,389
three things. So that's this guy and
immediate neighbor on one side and

108
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
immediate neighbor on one side and
 

109
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,990
immediate neighbor on one side and
immediate neighbor on the other. And

110
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
immediate neighbor on the other. And
 

111
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,309
immediate neighbor on the other. And
each of them gets multiplied by a

112
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
each of them gets multiplied by a
 

113
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,309
each of them gets multiplied by a
particular weight added up a bias is

114
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
particular weight added up a bias is
 

115
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,990
particular weight added up a bias is
added and that generates the output. So

116
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
added and that generates the output. So
 

117
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,949
added and that generates the output. So
that's we talked about this before

118
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
that's we talked about this before
 

119
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,470
that's we talked about this before
things again recap of before in 2D the

120
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
things again recap of before in 2D the
 

121
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,750
things again recap of before in 2D the
neighborhoods just become a 2D

122
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
neighborhoods just become a 2D
 

123
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,710
neighborhoods just become a 2D
neighborhoods. So if you ever have any

124
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
neighborhoods. So if you ever have any
 

125
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,270
neighborhoods. So if you ever have any
confusion in uh continents about what's

126
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
confusion in uh continents about what's
 

127
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,550
confusion in uh continents about what's
going on I strongly recommend always go

128
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
going on I strongly recommend always go
 

129
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,030
going on I strongly recommend always go
back to the 1D case because you can draw

130
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
back to the 1D case because you can draw
 

131
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,830
back to the 1D case because you can draw
the 1D case a lot more easily and then

132
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
the 1D case a lot more easily and then
 

133
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,350
the 1D case a lot more easily and then
think about the 2D case because

134
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
think about the 2D case because
 

135
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,750
think about the 2D case because
everything typically just the 1D case

136
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
everything typically just the 1D case
 

137
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,110
everything typically just the 1D case
directly extends the 2D case.

138
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
directly extends the 2D case.
 

139
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,750
directly extends the 2D case.
Uh so this is the case where you just

140
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
Uh so this is the case where you just
 

141
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,309
Uh so this is the case where you just
have a single channel at the input, a

142
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
have a single channel at the input, a
 

143
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,229
have a single channel at the input, a
single channel at the output. And last

144
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
single channel at the output. And last
 

145
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,229
single channel at the output. And last
time we showed this picture which was

146
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
time we showed this picture which was
 

147
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,630
time we showed this picture which was
about if you have many channels at the

148
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
about if you have many channels at the
 

149
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,790
about if you have many channels at the
input,

150
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
input,
 

151
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,229
input,
what happens in a con? So you basically

152
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
what happens in a con? So you basically
 

153
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,309
what happens in a con? So you basically
have weights in your convolutional

154
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
have weights in your convolutional
 

155
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,350
have weights in your convolutional
filter. Um which again want to make a

156
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,360
filter. Um which again want to make a
 

157
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,670
filter. Um which again want to make a
note here. uh they're sometimes called

158
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
note here. uh they're sometimes called
 

159
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,990
note here. uh they're sometimes called
kernels in the context of the

160
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
kernels in the context of the
 

161
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,229
kernels in the context of the
convolutional neural net literature. I

162
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
convolutional neural net literature. I
 

163
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,750
convolutional neural net literature. I
know this can be confusing to many

164
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
know this can be confusing to many
 

165
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,430
know this can be confusing to many
students because this meaning of kernel

166
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
students because this meaning of kernel
 

167
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,910
students because this meaning of kernel
is different from the meaning of kernel

168
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:19,920
is different from the meaning of kernel
 

169
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,710
is different from the meaning of kernel
that you learned in your uh machine

170
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
that you learned in your uh machine
 

171
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,670
that you learned in your uh machine
learning class where you might have

172
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
learning class where you might have
 

173
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,910
learning class where you might have
learned about kernel style methods for

174
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
learned about kernel style methods for
 

175
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,630
learned about kernel style methods for
example doing SVMs and other uh

176
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
example doing SVMs and other uh
 

177
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,350
example doing SVMs and other uh
classifiers. This is different but it's

178
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
classifiers. This is different but it's
 

179
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,910
classifiers. This is different but it's
also the same word kernel. Uh

180
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
also the same word kernel. Uh
 

181
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,910
also the same word kernel. Uh
so in that case the kernel is defined by

182
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
so in that case the kernel is defined by
 

183
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,910
so in that case the kernel is defined by
uh in this case a 3x3 tensor of weights

184
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
uh in this case a 3x3 tensor of weights
 

185
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,070
uh in this case a 3x3 tensor of weights
where these weights over here correspond

186
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
where these weights over here correspond
 

187
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,149
where these weights over here correspond
to the blue channel. These weights

188
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,159
to the blue channel. These weights
 

189
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,910
to the blue channel. These weights
correspond to the green channel and

190
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
correspond to the green channel and
 

191
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,589
correspond to the green channel and
these weights correspond to the red

192
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
these weights correspond to the red
 

193
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,630
these weights correspond to the red
channel and you simply apply the same

194
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
channel and you simply apply the same
 

195
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,070
channel and you simply apply the same
thing you apply in sort of the

196
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
thing you apply in sort of the
 

197
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,350
thing you apply in sort of the
one-dimensional case and you add

198
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
one-dimensional case and you add
 

199
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,509
one-dimensional case and you add
everything up to get a single output.

200
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
everything up to get a single output.
 

201
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,949
everything up to get a single output.
And last time there was a question about

202
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
And last time there was a question about
 

203
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,550
And last time there was a question about
what happens if there's many outputs. So

204
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
what happens if there's many outputs. So
 

205
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,229
what happens if there's many outputs. So
I decided that it's maybe it's really

206
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
I decided that it's maybe it's really
 

207
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,670
I decided that it's maybe it's really
good for everyone to really understand

208
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
good for everyone to really understand
 

209
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,949
good for everyone to really understand
this. So I'm going to spend a little bit

210
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
this. So I'm going to spend a little bit
 

211
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,509
this. So I'm going to spend a little bit
more time on this topic. Okay. So let's

212
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
more time on this topic. Okay. So let's
 

213
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,470
more time on this topic. Okay. So let's
let's do this together.

214
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
let's do this together.
 

215
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,870
let's do this together.
So what are we going to do? We're going

216
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
So what are we going to do? We're going
 

217
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,949
So what are we going to do? We're going
to say

218
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
to say
 

219
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,909
to say
let's look at the most basic case first

220
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
let's look at the most basic case first
 

221
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,189
let's look at the most basic case first
which is there's a one by one conf.

222
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
which is there's a one by one conf.
 

223
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,830
which is there's a one by one conf.
There's one channel at the input and one

224
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
There's one channel at the input and one
 

225
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,870
There's one channel at the input and one
channel at the output. So what does that

226
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
channel at the output. So what does that
 

227
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,710
channel at the output. So what does that
mean? That means for every pixel one by

228
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
mean? That means for every pixel one by
 

229
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,790
mean? That means for every pixel one by
one means you just look at it itself

230
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
one means you just look at it itself
 

231
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,550
one means you just look at it itself
neighborhood the one by one neighborhood

232
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
neighborhood the one by one neighborhood
 

233
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,909
neighborhood the one by one neighborhood
centered on that pixel which is just

234
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
centered on that pixel which is just
 

235
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,510
centered on that pixel which is just
itself

236
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
itself
 

237
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,390
itself
for every pixel a convolutional filter

238
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
for every pixel a convolutional filter
 

239
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,670
for every pixel a convolutional filter
is a linear fine if you have the bias

240
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
is a linear fine if you have the bias
 

241
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,830
is a linear fine if you have the bias
operation. So what can you do to a

242
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
operation. So what can you do to a
 

243
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,830
operation. So what can you do to a
single input you can scale it by a

244
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
single input you can scale it by a
 

245
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,950
single input you can scale it by a
constant and add a bias

246
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
constant and add a bias
 

247
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,749
constant and add a bias
and both the constant you scale by and

248
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
and both the constant you scale by and
 

249
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,790
and both the constant you scale by and
the bias are learnable weights.

250
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
the bias are learnable weights.
 

251
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,150
the bias are learnable weights.
So let's start with the

252
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
So let's start with the
 

253
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,230
So let's start with the
simple case here.

254
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240

 

255
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,909

How many weights are there and how many

256
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
How many weights are there and how many
 

257
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,390
How many weights are there and how many
biases? Okay, one and one. Right,

258
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400

 

259
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,710

everyone should be with me here. Now

260
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
everyone should be with me here. Now
 

261
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,270
everyone should be with me here. Now
let's do the 3x3 case. 3x3 case with one

262
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
let's do the 3x3 case. 3x3 case with one
 

263
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,990
let's do the 3x3 case. 3x3 case with one
channel input and one channel output. So

264
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
channel input and one channel output. So
 

265
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,990
channel input and one channel output. So
again, what does it mean 3x3? 3x3 means

266
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
again, what does it mean 3x3? 3x3 means
 

267
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,510
again, what does it mean 3x3? 3x3 means
look at the 3x3 neighborhood centered on

268
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
look at the 3x3 neighborhood centered on
 

269
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,950
look at the 3x3 neighborhood centered on
this pixel. So 3x3

270
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
this pixel. So 3x3
 

271
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,950
this pixel. So 3x3
neighborhood centered on the pixel. You

272
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
neighborhood centered on the pixel. You
 

273
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,189
neighborhood centered on the pixel. You
can think of it this way. The weight

274
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
can think of it this way. The weight
 

275
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,189
can think of it this way. The weight
associated with me, the weight

276
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
associated with me, the weight
 

277
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,029
associated with me, the weight
associated my north neighbor, the weight

278
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
associated my north neighbor, the weight
 

279
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,870
associated my north neighbor, the weight
associated with my south neighbor, my

280
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
associated with my south neighbor, my
 

281
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,710
associated with my south neighbor, my
east neighbor, my west neighbor, my

282
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
east neighbor, my west neighbor, my
 

283
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,710
east neighbor, my west neighbor, my
northwest neighbor, and so on. Okay,

284
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
northwest neighbor, and so on. Okay,
 

285
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,310
northwest neighbor, and so on. Okay,
that's if you want to think of it as

286
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
that's if you want to think of it as
 

287
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,189
that's if you want to think of it as
what these weights are. This kind of

288
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
what these weights are. This kind of
 

289
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,029
what these weights are. This kind of
local perspective helps many people as

290
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
local perspective helps many people as
 

291
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,950
local perspective helps many people as
opposed to simply having the numbers

292
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
opposed to simply having the numbers
 

293
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,950
opposed to simply having the numbers
because it tells you that it's always

294
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
because it tells you that it's always
 

295
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,590
because it tells you that it's always
ref centered somewhere

296
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
ref centered somewhere
 

297
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,390
ref centered somewhere
and it's local around there.

298
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
and it's local around there.
 

299
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,550
and it's local around there.
So what do you do? You scale the values

300
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
So what do you do? You scale the values
 

301
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,870
So what do you do? You scale the values
at this pixel

302
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
at this pixel
 

303
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,870
at this pixel
and its immediate neighbors by

304
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
and its immediate neighbors by
 

305
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,749
and its immediate neighbors by
individual widths. Meaning every single

306
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
individual widths. Meaning every single
 

307
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,670
individual widths. Meaning every single
neighborhood gets its own individualized

308
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
neighborhood gets its own individualized
 

309
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,749
neighborhood gets its own individualized
width. The northwest neighbor is

310
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
width. The northwest neighbor is
 

311
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,749
width. The northwest neighbor is
different than the northeast neighbor is

312
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
different than the northeast neighbor is
 

313
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,749
different than the northeast neighbor is
different than the south neighbor. and

314
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
different than the south neighbor. and
 

315
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,309
different than the south neighbor. and
you can tell them apart because you also

316
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
you can tell them apart because you also
 

317
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,070
you can tell them apart because you also
you know how to look in different

318
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
you know how to look in different
 

319
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,070
you know how to look in different
directions.

320
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
directions.
 

321
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,590
directions.
You add them up and add a bias. Okay. So

322
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
You add them up and add a bias. Okay. So
 

323
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,270
You add them up and add a bias. Okay. So
now everyone take five seconds or 10

324
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
now everyone take five seconds or 10
 

325
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,309
now everyone take five seconds or 10
seconds to think how many weights are

326
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
seconds to think how many weights are
 

327
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,990
seconds to think how many weights are
there and how many biases are there in

328
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
there and how many biases are there in
 

329
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,670
there and how many biases are there in
this case. Okay. So let's count.

330
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680

 

331
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,629

Okay. So

332
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
Okay. So
 

333
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,790
Okay. So
anyone raise your hand or shout out how

334
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
anyone raise your hand or shout out how
 

335
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,990
anyone raise your hand or shout out how
many weights?

336
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
many weights?
 

337
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,390
many weights?
>> Nine.

338
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
>> Nine.
 

339
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,070
>> Nine.
>> Nine. Okay. How many biases?

340
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
>> Nine. Okay. How many biases?
 

341
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,550
>> Nine. Okay. How many biases?
>> One.

342
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
>> One.
 

343
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,510
>> One.
>> One. Okay. Very good. So the basic story

344
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
>> One. Okay. Very good. So the basic story
 

345
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,469
>> One. Okay. Very good. So the basic story
should be clear. So now let's change it

346
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
should be clear. So now let's change it
 

347
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,029
should be clear. So now let's change it
to the picture we had before.

348
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
to the picture we had before.
 

349
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,189
to the picture we had before.
We have a 3x3 con with C in channels

350
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
We have a 3x3 con with C in channels
 

351
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,870
We have a 3x3 con with C in channels
as the input and one output.

352
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
as the input and one output.
 

353
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,790
as the input and one output.
So what does this mean?

354
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
So what does this mean?
 

355
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,189
So what does this mean?
This means that we repeat the process we

356
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
This means that we repeat the process we
 

357
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,189
This means that we repeat the process we
did here for each channel. So each

358
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
did here for each channel. So each
 

359
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,430
did here for each channel. So each
channel has its own mi weight, northwest

360
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
channel has its own mi weight, northwest
 

361
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,110
channel has its own mi weight, northwest
weight, northwe and so on. And then you

362
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
weight, northwe and so on. And then you
 

363
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,110
weight, northwe and so on. And then you
add them up. You fold all those things

364
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
add them up. You fold all those things
 

365
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,950
add them up. You fold all those things
together by adding them up. And then you

366
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
together by adding them up. And then you
 

367
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,070
together by adding them up. And then you
add a bias.

368
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
add a bias.
 

369
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,110
add a bias.
Okay. So now

370
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
Okay. So now
 

371
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,270
Okay. So now
everyone take 30 seconds to tell me to

372
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
everyone take 30 seconds to tell me to
 

373
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,550
everyone take 30 seconds to tell me to
sit maybe talk to your neighbor, make

374
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
sit maybe talk to your neighbor, make
 

375
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,710
sit maybe talk to your neighbor, make
sure you understand it. How many weights

376
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
sure you understand it. How many weights
 

377
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,110
sure you understand it. How many weights
and how many biases are there?

378
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
and how many biases are there?
 

379
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:26,950
and how many biases are there?
>> Okay, so just watch the time.

380
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960

 

381
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,070

Okay, 30 seconds are done.

382
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
Okay, 30 seconds are done.
 

383
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,149
Okay, 30 seconds are done.
>> Okay, so now

384
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
>> Okay, so now
 

385
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,389
>> Okay, so now
anyone want to tell me how many weights

386
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
anyone want to tell me how many weights
 

387
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,029
anyone want to tell me how many weights
are there? First, I'll ask a question.

388
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
are there? First, I'll ask a question.
 

389
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,110
are there? First, I'll ask a question.
Does anyone How many people have the

390
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
Does anyone How many people have the
 

391
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,550
Does anyone How many people have the
answer? Raise your hand if you have the

392
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
answer? Raise your hand if you have the
 

393
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,709
answer? Raise your hand if you have the
answer. Okay. How many people are

394
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
answer. Okay. How many people are
 

395
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,430
answer. Okay. How many people are
uncertain what the answer is? A couple

396
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440
uncertain what the answer is? A couple
 

397
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,990
uncertain what the answer is? A couple
of people are uncertain. U anyone who's

398
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
of people are uncertain. U anyone who's
 

399
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,070
of people are uncertain. U anyone who's
uncertain feel brave enough to express

400
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
uncertain feel brave enough to express
 

401
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,949
uncertain feel brave enough to express
their uncertainty.

402
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
their uncertainty.
 

403
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,350
their uncertainty.
>> 27.

404
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
>> 27.
 

405
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,269
>> 27.
>> Okay. So, uh here's the thing, right? In

406
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
>> Okay. So, uh here's the thing, right? In
 

407
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,030
>> Okay. So, uh here's the thing, right? In
this particular case, I've changed one

408
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
this particular case, I've changed one
 

409
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,990
this particular case, I've changed one
of the things into a symbolic thing CN

410
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
of the things into a symbolic thing CN
 

411
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,910
of the things into a symbolic thing CN
because in the in the context of a

412
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
because in the in the context of a
 

413
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,070
because in the in the context of a
connet, as you you might start off with

414
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,080
connet, as you you might start off with
 

415
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,750
connet, as you you might start off with
a color image that has three channels,

416
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
a color image that has three channels,
 

417
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,590
a color image that has three channels,
but as you go deeper and deeper into the

418
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
but as you go deeper and deeper into the
 

419
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,430
but as you go deeper and deeper into the
network, you'll change as part of your

420
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
network, you'll change as part of your
 

421
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,990
network, you'll change as part of your
design how many channels there are. Like

422
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
design how many channels there are. Like
 

423
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,190
design how many channels there are. Like
I said before, you know, you think about

424
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
I said before, you know, you think about
 

425
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,949
I said before, you know, you think about
intuitively you have a hand detector, a

426
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
intuitively you have a hand detector, a
 

427
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,870
intuitively you have a hand detector, a
foot detector, a parrot detector, you

428
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
foot detector, a parrot detector, you
 

429
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,070
foot detector, a parrot detector, you
know, and this is going to change at

430
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
know, and this is going to change at
 

431
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,470
know, and this is going to change at
different levels. So, we have to think

432
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
different levels. So, we have to think
 

433
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,910
different levels. So, we have to think
about it in terms of CN. The answer

434
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
about it in terms of CN. The answer
 

435
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,710
about it in terms of CN. The answer
should involve CN. Okay. So now someone

436
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
should involve CN. Okay. So now someone
 

437
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,310
should involve CN. Okay. So now someone
raise your hand to tell me the answer

438
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
raise your hand to tell me the answer
 

439
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,269
raise your hand to tell me the answer
who feels confident the answer. Yeah.

440
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
who feels confident the answer. Yeah.
 

441
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,350
who feels confident the answer. Yeah.
>> 9 * CN weights.

442
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360
>> 9 * CN weights.
 

443
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,910
>> 9 * CN weights.
>> Okay. Great.

444
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
>> Okay. Great.
 

445
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,269
>> Okay. Great.
Nine CN weights. And how many biases?

446
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
Nine CN weights. And how many biases?
 

447
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:41,750
Nine CN weights. And how many biases?
>> One.

448
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
>> One.
 

449
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,470
>> One.
>> One. Excellent. So this nine

450
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
>> One. Excellent. So this nine
 

451
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,110
>> One. Excellent. So this nine
is the same as that nine.

452
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
is the same as that nine.
 

453
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,710
is the same as that nine.
Right. This is the idea that you repeat

454
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
Right. This is the idea that you repeat
 

455
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,230
Right. This is the idea that you repeat
for every input channel.

456
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
for every input channel.
 

457
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,470
for every input channel.
Okay. So now let's generalize it one

458
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
Okay. So now let's generalize it one
 

459
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,710
Okay. So now let's generalize it one
step further.

460
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
step further.
 

461
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,870
step further.
We were talking about 3x3 before. Let's

462
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
We were talking about 3x3 before. Let's
 

463
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,790
We were talking about 3x3 before. Let's
think about K by K. Yeah.

464
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
think about K by K. Yeah.
 

465
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,829
think about K by K. Yeah.
>> Should be CN.

466
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
>> Should be CN.
 

467
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,750
>> Should be CN.
>> Okay, that's an excellent question. Let

468
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
>> Okay, that's an excellent question. Let
 

469
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,670
>> Okay, that's an excellent question. Let
me uh repeat it for the recording and

470
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
me uh repeat it for the recording and
 

471
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,150
me uh repeat it for the recording and
then uh make sure that I answer it. So

472
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
then uh make sure that I answer it. So
 

473
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,470
then uh make sure that I answer it. So
the question was why isn't the number of

474
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
the question was why isn't the number of
 

475
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,190
the question was why isn't the number of
biases C in as opposed to one? Okay, so

476
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
biases C in as opposed to one? Okay, so
 

477
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,190
biases C in as opposed to one? Okay, so
the reason the number of biases we think

478
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
the reason the number of biases we think
 

479
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,550
the reason the number of biases we think
of as being one is that suppose we had C

480
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
of as being one is that suppose we had C
 

481
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,269
of as being one is that suppose we had C
in individual biases, we're going to add

482
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
in individual biases, we're going to add
 

483
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,430
in individual biases, we're going to add
everything up together anyway to get a

484
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
everything up together anyway to get a
 

485
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,069
everything up together anyway to get a
single output. So when you add a bunch

486
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
single output. So when you add a bunch
 

487
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,590
single output. So when you add a bunch
of scalers together, you'll just get

488
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
of scalers together, you'll just get
 

489
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,990
of scalers together, you'll just get
another scaler. So in terms of

490
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
another scaler. So in terms of
 

491
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,829
another scaler. So in terms of
expressive power, we get the same

492
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
expressive power, we get the same
 

493
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,069
expressive power, we get the same
expressive power by having one bias as

494
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
expressive power by having one bias as
 

495
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,590
expressive power by having one bias as
we would by having C in different

496
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
we would by having C in different
 

497
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,230
we would by having C in different
biases. That's the side of expressive

498
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
biases. That's the side of expressive
 

499
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,230
biases. That's the side of expressive
power. The second part of it you could

500
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
power. The second part of it you could
 

501
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,790
power. The second part of it you could
think about in terms of

502
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
think about in terms of
 

503
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,750
think about in terms of
what happens with the gradients that are

504
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
what happens with the gradients that are
 

505
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,670
what happens with the gradients that are
back propped backwards in the neural

506
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:55,680
back propped backwards in the neural
 

507
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,030
back propped backwards in the neural
net. So when the gradients go back, are

508
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
net. So when the gradients go back, are
 

509
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,110
net. So when the gradients go back, are
the gradients going to be different on

510
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
the gradients going to be different on
 

511
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,870
the gradients going to be different on
the different biases that you're hypo

512
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
the different biases that you're hypo
 

513
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,870
the different biases that you're hypo
hypo hypothesizing? And the answer is

514
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
hypo hypothesizing? And the answer is
 

515
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,310
hypo hypothesizing? And the answer is
no, they won't because they're just

516
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
no, they won't because they're just
 

517
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,590
no, they won't because they're just
being added in. Right? So that if you if

518
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
being added in. Right? So that if you if
 

519
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,829
being added in. Right? So that if you if
the forward layer, the layer at the

520
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
the forward layer, the layer at the
 

521
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,269
the forward layer, the layer at the
other side says I would like this input

522
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
other side says I would like this input
 

523
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,430
other side says I would like this input
to be a little bigger

524
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
to be a little bigger
 

525
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,190
to be a little bigger
on all those biases will say make them

526
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
on all those biases will say make them
 

527
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,630
on all those biases will say make them
all a little bit bigger by the same

528
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
all a little bit bigger by the same
 

529
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,750
all a little bit bigger by the same
amount. the weights have different

530
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
amount. the weights have different
 

531
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,430
amount. the weights have different
gradients because they are also

532
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
gradients because they are also
 

533
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,990
gradients because they are also
modulated by the specific inputs at that

534
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
modulated by the specific inputs at that
 

535
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,310
modulated by the specific inputs at that
channel. So that's for both of these

536
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
channel. So that's for both of these
 

537
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,150
channel. So that's for both of these
reasons we go for a single bias as

538
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
reasons we go for a single bias as
 

539
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,750
reasons we go for a single bias as
opposed to having uh CN biases. Yeah,

540
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
opposed to having uh CN biases. Yeah,
 

541
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,430
opposed to having uh CN biases. Yeah,

we'll talk about the multiple outputs

548
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
we'll talk about the multiple outputs
 

549
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,870
we'll talk about the multiple outputs
case.

550
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
case.
 

551
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,550
case.
But before we go to multiple outputs, I

552
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
But before we go to multiple outputs, I
 

553
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,790
But before we go to multiple outputs, I
just want to make sure that everyone

554
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
just want to make sure that everyone
 

555
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,670
just want to make sure that everyone
says now I've talked about a 3x3 con

556
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
says now I've talked about a 3x3 con
 

557
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,190
says now I've talked about a 3x3 con
here where you had this number nine.

558
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
here where you had this number nine.
 

559
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,630
here where you had this number nine.
So now let's think about a k by k con a

560
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:58,640
So now let's think about a k by k con a
 

561
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,389
So now let's think about a k by k con a
5 by five a seven by seven a 9 by 9 any

562
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
5 by five a seven by seven a 9 by 9 any
 

563
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,230
5 by five a seven by seven a 9 by 9 any
such number. So, how many weights are

564
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
such number. So, how many weights are
 

565
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,030
such number. So, how many weights are
there now? Here I think does everyone

566
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
there now? Here I think does everyone
 

567
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,389
there now? Here I think does everyone
can everyone just answer the question

568
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
can everyone just answer the question
 

569
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,750
can everyone just answer the question
right now? Do you have the idea? I don't

570
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
right now? Do you have the idea? I don't
 

571
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,350
right now? Do you have the idea? I don't
want to go too slowly, but uh if you

572
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
want to go too slowly, but uh if you
 

573
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,790
want to go too slowly, but uh if you
need time to think, tell me if you need

574
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
need time to think, tell me if you need
 

575
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,350
need time to think, tell me if you need
time to think. Okay, so what's the

576
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
time to think. Okay, so what's the
 

577
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,790
time to think. Okay, so what's the
answer? Just shout it out everybody.

578
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
answer? Just shout it out everybody.
 

579
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,350
answer? Just shout it out everybody.
>> Okay, excellent. K2 CN,

how many biases?

582
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
how many biases?
 

583
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,190
how many biases?
>> One.

584
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
>> One.
 

585
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,670
>> One.
>> One. Great. So now you understand the

586
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
>> One. Great. So now you understand the
 

587
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,949
>> One. Great. So now you understand the
general pattern. Now if you think about

588
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
general pattern. Now if you think about
 

589
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,790
general pattern. Now if you think about
the weights here and on discussion we'll

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
the weights here and on discussion we'll
 

591
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,350
the weights here and on discussion we'll
have you talk about it a number like k^

592
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
have you talk about it a number like k^

600
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
had before that you can store these
 

601
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,230
had before that you can store these
different weights in an interesting

602
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
different weights in an interesting
 

603
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,110
different weights in an interesting
structure, right? So this structure is

604
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
structure, right? So this structure is
 

605
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,509
structure, right? So this structure is
naturally a CN by K by K tensor, right?

606
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
naturally a CN by K by K tensor, right?
 

607
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,030
naturally a CN by K by K tensor, right?
K by K for the filter to apply at a

608
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
K by K for the filter to apply at a
 

609
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,829
K by K for the filter to apply at a
particular channel and another K another

610
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
particular channel and another K another
 

611
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,430
particular channel and another K another
another another CN sorry for how many of

612
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
another another CN sorry for how many of
 

613
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,470
another another CN sorry for how many of
them there are okay

614
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
them there are okay
 

615
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,550
them there are okay
so now

616
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
so now
 

617
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,990
so now
let's have the case of multiple outputs

618
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
let's have the case of multiple outputs
 

619
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,750
let's have the case of multiple outputs
so we talked about this before so I just

620
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
so we talked about this before so I just
 

621
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,670
so we talked about this before so I just
copied it over exactly from what I wrote

622
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
copied it over exactly from what I wrote
 

623
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,030
copied it over exactly from what I wrote
before if you have a one by one con with

624
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
before if you have a one by one con with
 

625
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,389
before if you have a one by one con with
C in channel inputs and C outputs what

626
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
C in channel inputs and C outputs what
 

627
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,310
C in channel inputs and C outputs what
does that look like so we talked about

628
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
does that look like so we talked about
 

629
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,990
does that look like so we talked about
this before and we said that now that

630
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,000
this before and we said that now that
 

631
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,310
this before and we said that now that
you have all of these different outputs,

632
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
you have all of these different outputs,
 

633
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,870
you have all of these different outputs,
we can take all of these outputs and in

634
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
we can take all of these outputs and in
 

635
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,190
we can take all of these outputs and in
this picture stack them up as a vector.

636
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
this picture stack them up as a vector.
 

637
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,430
this picture stack them up as a vector.
We can take the vector all the CN inputs

638
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
We can take the vector all the CN inputs
 

639
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,509
We can take the vector all the CN inputs
and stack them up as a vector. So at

640
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519
and stack them up as a vector. So at
 

641
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,910
and stack them up as a vector. So at
every pixel now the information that's

642
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
every pixel now the information that's
 

643
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,230
every pixel now the information that's
carried is a vector of size CN and at

644
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
carried is a vector of size CN and at
 

645
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,470
carried is a vector of size CN and at
the output at every pixel you're going

646
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
the output at every pixel you're going
 

647
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,110
the output at every pixel you're going
to have a vector that's y and it's going

648
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
to have a vector that's y and it's going
 

649
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,310
to have a vector that's y and it's going
to be of size c out.

650
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
to be of size c out.
 

651
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,190
to be of size c out.
So a linear operation an aphine

652
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,200
So a linear operation an aphine
 

653
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,430
So a linear operation an aphine
operation that acts on a vector and

654
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
operation that acts on a vector and
 

655
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,670
operation that acts on a vector and
returns a vector looks like this.

656
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680

 

657
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,389

So now we can ask the question how many

658
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
So now we can ask the question how many
 

659
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,949
So now we can ask the question how many
weights and how many biases

660
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959

 

661
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,030

>> is it? So first how many people know the

662
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
>> is it? So first how many people know the
 

663
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,509
>> is it? So first how many people know the
answer?

664
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
answer?
 

665
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,189
answer?
How many people are unsure?

666
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199

 

667
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,629

Okay. Um some of you are not answering

668
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
Okay. Um some of you are not answering
 

669
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,230
Okay. Um some of you are not answering
the question of whether you know the

670
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
the question of whether you know the
 

671
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,670
the question of whether you know the
answer or unsure. Uh so let's uh

672
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
answer or unsure. Uh so let's uh
 

673
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,910
answer or unsure. Uh so let's uh
everyone take uh 20 seconds and talk

674
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:29,920
everyone take uh 20 seconds and talk
 

675
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,230
everyone take uh 20 seconds and talk
amongst yourselves to make sure you can

676
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
amongst yourselves to make sure you can
 

677
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,829
amongst yourselves to make sure you can
answer this question or at least express

678
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
answer this question or at least express
 

679
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,829
answer this question or at least express
your confusion to your neighbor. It's

680
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
your confusion to your neighbor. It's
 

681
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,269
your confusion to your neighbor. It's
important everyone gets this. So that's

682
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:37,279
important everyone gets this. So that's
 

683
00:14:37,279 --> 00:15:03,110
important everyone gets this. So that's
why I'm doing this. So start.

684
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120

 

685
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,389

>> Okay. So again, interest of time, I'm

686
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
>> Okay. So again, interest of time, I'm
 

687
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,310
>> Okay. So again, interest of time, I'm
going to keep uh

688
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
going to keep uh
 

689
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,310
going to keep uh
So who can answer the question? How many

690
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
So who can answer the question? How many
 

691
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,230
So who can answer the question? How many
weights are there? The weights are the

692
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
weights are there? The weights are the
 

693
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,189
weights are there? The weights are the
entries inside this matrix. The biases

694
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:15,199
entries inside this matrix. The biases
 

695
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,110
entries inside this matrix. The biases
are the entries inside this matrix. So

696
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
are the entries inside this matrix. So
 

697
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,750
are the entries inside this matrix. So
how many weights are there?

698
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
how many weights are there?
 

699
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,350
how many weights are there?
>> C in time C out.

700
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360

 

701
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,670

And how many biases?

702
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
And how many biases?
 

703
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,590
And how many biases?
>> C out.

704
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600

 

705
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,430

Okay. So everyone hopefully this is

706
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
Okay. So everyone hopefully this is
 

707
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,430
Okay. So everyone hopefully this is
making it clear what's going on here for

708
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:35,440
making it clear what's going on here for
 

709
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,990
making it clear what's going on here for
the one by one case. So now

710
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
the one by one case. So now
 

711
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,509
the one by one case. So now
let's everyone take a minute and do this

712
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
let's everyone take a minute and do this
 

713
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,110
let's everyone take a minute and do this
case a K by K con with C in channel

714
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
case a K by K con with C in channel
 

715
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,870
case a K by K con with C in channel
inputs and C outputs.

716
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
inputs and C outputs.
 

717
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,389
inputs and C outputs.
Just putting the pieces together of all

718
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
Just putting the pieces together of all
 

719
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,189
Just putting the pieces together of all
the pieces we've built.

720
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199

 

721
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,269

So start talk to each other. Make sure

722
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
So start talk to each other. Make sure
 

723
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:08,069
So start talk to each other. Make sure
you can

724
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079

 

725
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,509

If you feel like you're done at some

726
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
If you feel like you're done at some
 

727
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,350
If you feel like you're done at some
point, you can like raise your hand and

728
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
point, you can like raise your hand and
 

729
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,110
point, you can like raise your hand and
say that. Okay, we can move on. But it's

730
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
say that. Okay, we can move on. But it's
 

731
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,670
say that. Okay, we can move on. But it's
fine if people I'll give everyone a

732
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
fine if people I'll give everyone a
 

733
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:47,670
fine if people I'll give everyone a
minute.

734
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680

 

735
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,949

Okay, that's a minute. So, uh, someone

736
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
Okay, that's a minute. So, uh, someone
 

737
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,470
Okay, that's a minute. So, uh, someone
want to raise your hand to give the

738
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
want to raise your hand to give the
 

739
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,749
want to raise your hand to give the
answer

740
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
answer
 

741
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,590
answer
>> or does everyone shout it out? What's

742
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
>> or does everyone shout it out? What's
 

743
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,110
>> or does everyone shout it out? What's
the answer?

744
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120

 

745
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,150

Yep. K^ squ C in

746
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
Yep. K^ squ C in
 

747
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,150
Yep. K^ squ C in
C out. How many biases?

748
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
C out. How many biases?
 

749
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,870
C out. How many biases?
>> C.

750
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
>> C.
 

751
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,110
>> C.
>> C out.

752
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120

 

753
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,990

Okay. So again when you see a number

754
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
Okay. So again when you see a number
 

755
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,069
Okay. So again when you see a number
like K^ squ C and C out you should think

756
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
like K^ squ C and C out you should think
 

757
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,990
like K^ squ C and C out you should think
of this as a fourdimension as how you

758
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,000
of this as a fourdimension as how you
 

759
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,949
of this as a fourdimension as how you
represent it on disk or in memory as a

760
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
represent it on disk or in memory as a
 

761
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,029
represent it on disk or in memory as a
separate issue right than how many

762
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,039
separate issue right than how many
 

763
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,470
separate issue right than how many
parameters there are. But how would you

764
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
parameters there are. But how would you
 

765
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,909
parameters there are. But how would you
represent it? Well the natural structure

766
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
represent it? Well the natural structure
 

767
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,510
represent it? Well the natural structure
is there's a k by k matrix. There's one

768
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,520
is there's a k by k matrix. There's one
 

769
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,110
is there's a k by k matrix. There's one
of them for every channel that's at the

770
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,120
of them for every channel that's at the
 

771
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,510
of them for every channel that's at the
input and one of those for every channel

772
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,520
input and one of those for every channel
 

773
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,549
input and one of those for every channel
at the output. So see out C in K K is a

774
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
at the output. So see out C in K K is a
 

775
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,590
at the output. So see out C in K K is a
way to think about it.

776
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600
way to think about it.
 

777
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,710
way to think about it.
Okay. So now we've talked about the uh

778
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
Okay. So now we've talked about the uh
 

779
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,230
Okay. So now we've talked about the uh
filters and the next question is we have

780
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
filters and the next question is we have
 

781
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,430
filters and the next question is we have
back prop. How does backrop work? So on

782
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
back prop. How does backrop work? So on
 

783
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,350
back prop. How does backrop work? So on
the homework we have you grind it out

784
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
the homework we have you grind it out
 

785
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,029
the homework we have you grind it out
because you have to at some one time in

786
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
because you have to at some one time in
 

787
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,710
because you have to at some one time in
your life you have to just grind out

788
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:54,720
your life you have to just grind out
 

789
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,190
your life you have to just grind out
what the equations are on the homework

790
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,200
what the equations are on the homework
 

791
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,150
what the equations are on the homework
uh to make sure you understand it. We'll

792
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
uh to make sure you understand it. We'll
 

793
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,909
uh to make sure you understand it. We'll
but I want to talk about it conceptually

794
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
but I want to talk about it conceptually
 

795
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,909
but I want to talk about it conceptually
here and then you can work out the

796
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
here and then you can work out the
 

797
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,950
here and then you can work out the
details. So what's the question? So if

798
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
details. So what's the question? So if
 

799
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,270
details. So what's the question? So if
you go back to the first uh picture I

800
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
you go back to the first uh picture I
 

801
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,789
you go back to the first uh picture I
showed you

802
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799

 

803
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,270

know how backrop works for these things.

804
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
know how backrop works for these things.
 

805
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,909
know how backrop works for these things.
So now if you have back prop for

806
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
So now if you have back prop for
 

807
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,630
So now if you have back prop for
something that looks like this,

808
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
something that looks like this,
 

809
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,190
something that looks like this,
you can think of it intuitively as

810
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,200
you can think of it intuitively as
 

811
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,110
you can think of it intuitively as
there's two different conceptual

812
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,120
there's two different conceptual
 

813
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,150
there's two different conceptual
questions you have to answer.

814
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,160
questions you have to answer.
 

815
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,710
questions you have to answer.
First conceptual question. So here you

816
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
First conceptual question. So here you
 

817
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,470
First conceptual question. So here you
know how to compute gradients for every

818
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
know how to compute gradients for every
 

819
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,710
know how to compute gradients for every
single one of these entries. Is that

820
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:38,720
single one of these entries. Is that
 

821
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,190
single one of these entries. Is that
everyone with me on that? So you look

822
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,200
everyone with me on that? So you look
 

823
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,350
everyone with me on that? So you look
over here. What's different between here

824
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
over here. What's different between here
 

825
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,350
over here. What's different between here
and here?

826
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
and here?
 

827
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,230
and here?
So there's two qualitative differences.

828
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
So there's two qualitative differences.
 

829
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,909
So there's two qualitative differences.
One qualitative differences is that

830
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
One qualitative differences is that
 

831
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,990
One qualitative differences is that
there are a bunch of zeros here.

832
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
there are a bunch of zeros here.
 

833
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,710
there are a bunch of zeros here.
Everyone with me

834
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
Everyone with me
 

835
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,029
Everyone with me
and the other qualitative difference is

836
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
and the other qualitative difference is
 

837
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,029
and the other qualitative difference is
that you have the same thing in

838
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
that you have the same thing in
 

839
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,150
that you have the same thing in
different places.

840
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
different places.
 

841
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,230
different places.
Got it? Okay. So let's tackle these one

842
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
Got it? Okay. So let's tackle these one
 

843
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,990
Got it? Okay. So let's tackle these one
at a time.

844
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
at a time.
 

845
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,909
at a time.
So

846
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
So
 

847
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,150
So
first question is what do you do with

848
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
first question is what do you do with
 

849
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,230
first question is what do you do with
back prop on the zeros.

850
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,240
back prop on the zeros.
 

851
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,029
back prop on the zeros.
These are places where there's a a

852
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,039
These are places where there's a a
 

853
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,750
These are places where there's a a
structural constraint. We've induced we

854
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760
structural constraint. We've induced we
 

855
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,909
structural constraint. We've induced we
said that you will always have a zero

856
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:23,919
said that you will always have a zero
 

857
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,470
said that you will always have a zero
there. So if you just think about it as

858
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
there. So if you just think about it as
 

859
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,990
there. So if you just think about it as
though it were a a layer like this and

860
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000
though it were a a layer like this and
 

861
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,630
though it were a a layer like this and
you would execute back prop if you

862
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
you would execute back prop if you
 

863
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,909
you would execute back prop if you
pretend it's this you would get a

864
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
pretend it's this you would get a
 

865
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,310
pretend it's this you would get a
gradient that would show up here that

866
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
gradient that would show up here that
 

867
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,630
gradient that would show up here that
would say I really wish this zero were

868
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:38,640
would say I really wish this zero were
 

869
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,070
would say I really wish this zero were
something different. Does everyone see

870
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,080
something different. Does everyone see
 

871
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,870
something different. Does everyone see
that part in conceptually not in terms

872
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
that part in conceptually not in terms
 

873
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,270
that part in conceptually not in terms
of the implementation but conceptually?

874
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
of the implementation but conceptually?
 

875
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,350
of the implementation but conceptually?
Okay but what do we do with that?

876
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
Okay but what do we do with that?
 

877
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,350
Okay but what do we do with that?
Everyone have a anyone want to volunteer

878
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
Everyone have a anyone want to volunteer
 

879
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,110
Everyone have a anyone want to volunteer
a guess?

880
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,120

 

881
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,590

>> Yeah.

882
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
>> Yeah.
 

883
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,110
>> Yeah.
>> Do you just ignore the gradient there

884
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
>> Do you just ignore the gradient there
 

885
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,190
>> Do you just ignore the gradient there
and don't do any updates with it?

886
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
and don't do any updates with it?
 

887
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,430
and don't do any updates with it?
>> Excellent. The comment was we want the

888
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440
>> Excellent. The comment was we want the
 

889
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,789
>> Excellent. The comment was we want the
structural constraint that this is

890
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
structural constraint that this is
 

891
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,789
structural constraint that this is
always zero. So we're not interested in

892
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
always zero. So we're not interested in
 

893
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,549
always zero. So we're not interested in
knowing whether it wants to move up or

894
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
knowing whether it wants to move up or
 

895
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,150
knowing whether it wants to move up or
down because we've already decided it's

896
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:08,160
down because we've already decided it's
 

897
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,950
down because we've already decided it's
always going to be zero. So we basically

898
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
always going to be zero. So we basically
 

899
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,430
always going to be zero. So we basically
ignore that gradient. This is a

900
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
ignore that gradient. This is a
 

901
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,350
ignore that gradient. This is a
conceptual point of view. If you think

902
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
conceptual point of view. If you think
 

903
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,150
conceptual point of view. If you think
about this as the your reference point,

904
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,160
about this as the your reference point,
 

905
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,470
about this as the your reference point,
practically speaking, we never compute

906
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
practically speaking, we never compute
 

907
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,990
practically speaking, we never compute
it.

908
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,000
it.
 

909
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,990
it.
Okay, you could compute it, but we just

910
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay, you could compute it, but we just
 

911
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,470
Okay, you could compute it, but we just
don't compute it ever.

912
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,480
don't compute it ever.
 

913
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,070
don't compute it ever.
Okay, so that's the easy one. The next

914
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
Okay, so that's the easy one. The next
 

915
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,270
Okay, so that's the easy one. The next
one is what do you do with the things

916
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
one is what do you do with the things
 

917
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,110
one is what do you do with the things
that are shared? The weights that are

918
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
that are shared? The weights that are
 

919
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,390
that are shared? The weights that are
shared. So that's what I want to talk

920
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
shared. So that's what I want to talk
 

921
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,750
shared. So that's what I want to talk
about.

922
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760

 

923
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,750

Okay,

924
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:41,760
Okay,
 

925
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,149
Okay,
so the question is we want to comput a

926
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:44,159
so the question is we want to comput a
 

927
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,510
so the question is we want to comput a
gradient. So if there's a particular

928
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
gradient. So if there's a particular
 

929
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,070
gradient. So if there's a particular
weight, some weight,

930
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
weight, some weight,
 

931
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,710
weight, some weight,
how can we compute the derivative of the

932
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
how can we compute the derivative of the
 

933
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,870
how can we compute the derivative of the
loss with respect to that weight when

934
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
loss with respect to that weight when
 

935
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,750
loss with respect to that weight when
the same parameter w appears in

936
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:55,760
the same parameter w appears in
 

937
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,430
the same parameter w appears in
different places in the computational

938
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
different places in the computational
 

939
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,909
different places in the computational
graph.

940
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
graph.
 

941
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,350
graph.
Okay, so what does that mean in the

942
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
Okay, so what does that mean in the
 

943
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,830
Okay, so what does that mean in the
context of a connet? It's that the

944
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
context of a connet? It's that the
 

945
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,270
context of a connet? It's that the
reason this is happening is the same

946
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
reason this is happening is the same
 

947
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,870
reason this is happening is the same
filter is being applied at different

948
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
filter is being applied at different
 

949
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,590
filter is being applied at different
places. So the computation graph

950
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
places. So the computation graph
 

951
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,350
places. So the computation graph
involves some computations that are

952
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,360
involves some computations that are
 

953
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,909
involves some computations that are
happening at this part of the image. It

954
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:15,919
happening at this part of the image. It
 

955
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,190
happening at this part of the image. It
also involves some computations

956
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
also involves some computations
 

957
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,630
also involves some computations
happening at this part of the image.

958
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640
happening at this part of the image.
 

959
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,070
happening at this part of the image.
Both of those involve that same

960
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
Both of those involve that same
 

961
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,390
Both of those involve that same
parameter.

962
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
parameter.
 

963
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,870
parameter.
So in the computation graph the same

964
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:24,880
So in the computation graph the same
 

965
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,110
So in the computation graph the same
parameter appears multiple places. So

966
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
parameter appears multiple places. So
 

967
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,350
parameter appears multiple places. So
what do you do?

968
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
what do you do?
 

969
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,710
what do you do?
Now you can think about it in terms of

970
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
Now you can think about it in terms of
 

971
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,789
Now you can think about it in terms of
the chain rule which is what you know

972
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
the chain rule which is what you know
 

973
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,510
the chain rule which is what you know
this is uh but it's also nice to

974
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,520
this is uh but it's also nice to
 

975
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,350
this is uh but it's also nice to
understand at a very basic level and so

976
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
understand at a very basic level and so
 

977
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,950
understand at a very basic level and so
you have to always also keep in mind the

978
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
you have to always also keep in mind the
 

979
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,029
you have to always also keep in mind the
easy answer which is don't worry

980
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
easy answer which is don't worry
 

981
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,909
easy answer which is don't worry
pietorch will handle it which is true

982
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
pietorch will handle it which is true
 

983
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,110
pietorch will handle it which is true
which is why these um these packages

984
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
which is why these um these packages
 

985
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,750
which is why these um these packages
like jacks and pietorch and tensorflow

986
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
like jacks and pietorch and tensorflow
 

987
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,510
like jacks and pietorch and tensorflow
are so popular and so important is that

988
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
are so popular and so important is that
 

989
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,710
are so popular and so important is that
they will go through and do the

990
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,720
they will go through and do the
 

991
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,230
they will go through and do the
automatic differentiation on the graph

992
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,240
automatic differentiation on the graph
 

993
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,190
automatic differentiation on the graph
for

994
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,200
for
 

995
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,029
for
But it is good to know what's going on

996
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
But it is good to know what's going on
 

997
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,510
But it is good to know what's going on
behind the scenes because sometimes um

998
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
behind the scenes because sometimes um
 

999
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,029
behind the scenes because sometimes um
later in the class we'll talk about when

1000
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
later in the class we'll talk about when
 

1001
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,630
later in the class we'll talk about when
you want to stop it from doing things.

1002
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:08,640
you want to stop it from doing things.
 

1003
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,590
you want to stop it from doing things.
So what's the underlying answer? Okay,

1004
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:11,600
So what's the underlying answer? Okay,
 

1005
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,830
So what's the underlying answer? Okay,
so there's two parts to them

1006
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840

 

1007
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,510

conceptually.

1008
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
conceptually.
 

1009
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,750
conceptually.
You can pretend that single weight w

1010
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:19,760
You can pretend that single weight w
 

1011
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,270
You can pretend that single weight w
that is shared across different places

1012
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
that is shared across different places
 

1013
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,590
that is shared across different places
in the computational graph was actually

1014
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:23,600
in the computational graph was actually
 

1015
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,590
in the computational graph was actually
different weights. You can think of them

1016
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
different weights. You can think of them
 

1017
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,230
different weights. You can think of them
as weld 1, weld 2 and so on. lots of

1018
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
as weld 1, weld 2 and so on. lots of
 

1019
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,430
as weld 1, weld 2 and so on. lots of
different everywhere it appeared it's a

1020
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:29,440
different everywhere it appeared it's a
 

1021
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,669
different everywhere it appeared it's a
different weight they just happen to be

1022
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:31,679
different weight they just happen to be
 

1023
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,909
different weight they just happen to be
the same value.

1024
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
the same value.
 

1025
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,590
the same value.
So you will compute a bunch of gradients

1026
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
So you will compute a bunch of gradients
 

1027
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,909
So you will compute a bunch of gradients
of the loss with respect to all of those

1028
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
of the loss with respect to all of those
 

1029
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,510
of the loss with respect to all of those
different positions in the computational

1030
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
different positions in the computational
 

1031
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,070
different positions in the computational
graph

1032
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
graph
 

1033
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,830
graph
and then you have to combine them in

1034
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
and then you have to combine them in
 

1035
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,230
and then you have to combine them in
some way and the way you combine them is

1036
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
some way and the way you combine them is
 

1037
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,549
some way and the way you combine them is
you add them up.

1038
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
you add them up.
 

1039
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,149
you add them up.
Okay, this is you can think of this

1040
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
Okay, this is you can think of this
 

1041
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,549
Okay, this is you can think of this
either from the chain rule or uh this

1042
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:54,559
either from the chain rule or uh this
 

1043
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,669
either from the chain rule or uh this
way get the same answer.

1044
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:57,679
way get the same answer.
 

1045
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,510
way get the same answer.
Okay. So

1046
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:01,520

 

1047
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,909

between now on the homework we'll ask

1048
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:03,919
between now on the homework we'll ask
 

1049
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,510
between now on the homework we'll ask
you to like work this out uh and to see

1050
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
you to like work this out uh and to see
 

1051
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,430
you to like work this out uh and to see
you know how it connects the inputs and

1052
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
you know how it connects the inputs and
 

1053
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,430
you know how it connects the inputs and
so on uh in the case of a conair.

1054
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
so on uh in the case of a conair.
 

1055
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,870
so on uh in the case of a conair.
Okay I'll pause here. Any questions on

1056
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:16,880
Okay I'll pause here. Any questions on
 

1057
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,149
Okay I'll pause here. Any questions on
the on how back prop works conceptually

1058
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
the on how back prop works conceptually
 

1059
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,669
the on how back prop works conceptually
when you have shared weights?

1060
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679

 

1061
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,470

Yeah.

1062
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
Yeah.
 

1063
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,830
Yeah.
>> Why are you adding as opposed to

1064
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
>> Why are you adding as opposed to
 

1065
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,590
>> Why are you adding as opposed to
averaging?

1066
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
averaging?
 

1067
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,750
averaging?
>> Great question. Why are we adding as

1068
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:31,760
>> Great question. Why are we adding as
 

1069
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,470
>> Great question. Why are we adding as
opposed to averaging?

1070
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:34,480
opposed to averaging?
 

1071
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,430
opposed to averaging?
So, uh

1072
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
So, uh
 

1073
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,870
So, uh
how can I explain why are we adding

1074
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
how can I explain why are we adding
 

1075
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,950
how can I explain why are we adding
instead of averaging? So, first answer

1076
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:40,960
instead of averaging? So, first answer
 

1077
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,270
instead of averaging? So, first answer
is that's how the math works out just

1078
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,280
is that's how the math works out just
 

1079
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,710
is that's how the math works out just
directly. If you do the chain rule math,

1080
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
directly. If you do the chain rule math,
 

1081
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,789
directly. If you do the chain rule math,
it it works out to adding. Um you might

1082
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:46,799
it it works out to adding. Um you might
 

1083
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,190
it it works out to adding. Um you might
ask so I will come back to your

1084
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
ask so I will come back to your
 

1085
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,870
ask so I will come back to your
intuition about this averaging. It's a

1086
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:50,880
intuition about this averaging. It's a
 

1087
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,470
intuition about this averaging. It's a
very good intuition of like why am I not

1088
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
very good intuition of like why am I not
 

1089
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,950
very good intuition of like why am I not
averaging? But the reason is that

1090
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
averaging? But the reason is that
 

1091
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,990
averaging? But the reason is that
actually in your computational graph if

1092
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
actually in your computational graph if
 

1093
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,549
actually in your computational graph if
you were to change hypothetically

1094
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:00,559
you were to change hypothetically
 

1095
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,909
you were to change hypothetically
one of those positions by a little bit,

1096
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:03,919
one of those positions by a little bit,
 

1097
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,750
one of those positions by a little bit,
right? It would change the loss by

1098
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
right? It would change the loss by
 

1099
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,470
right? It would change the loss by
this t term times that little bit of

1100
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,480
this t term times that little bit of
 

1101
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,390
this t term times that little bit of
change. You with me? If you were to

1102
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
change. You with me? If you were to
 

1103
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,029
change. You with me? If you were to
change another position by the same

1104
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
change another position by the same
 

1105
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,710
change another position by the same
amount,

1106
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:18,720
amount,
 

1107
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,950
amount,
how much would it change the loss?

1108
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:22,960

 

1109
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,110

the same amount. So if you change both

1110
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,120
the same amount. So if you change both
 

1111
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,269
the same amount. So if you change both
of them, how much would it change the

1112
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
of them, how much would it change the
 

1113
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,470
of them, how much would it change the

>> The two quantities combined.

1116
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:29,840
>> The two quantities combined.
 

1117
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,830
>> The two quantities combined.
>> Two quantities added. That tells you why

1118
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:31,840
>> Two quantities added. That tells you why
 

1119
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,230
>> Two quantities added. That tells you why
you added. Okay? Because the actual

1120
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,240
you added. Okay? Because the actual
 

1121
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,950
you added. Okay? Because the actual
gradient is the sum.

1122
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
gradient is the sum.
 

1123
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,269
gradient is the sum.
>> Okay. Now,

1124
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:39,279
>> Okay. Now,
 

1125
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,549
>> Okay. Now,
so go ahead. I'll take another question.

1126
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
so go ahead. I'll take another question.
 

1127
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,190
so go ahead. I'll take another question.
I'll come back to your

1128
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,200
I'll come back to your
 

1129
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,390
I'll come back to your
>> average.

1130
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,400

 

1131
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,430

It's almost like in physics you're

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,110
the the net I guess movement.
>> Excellent. So you brought up the word of

1142
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
>> Excellent. So you brought up the word of
 

1143
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,269
>> Excellent. So you brought up the word of
superposition which is the way that we

1144
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279
superposition which is the way that we
 

1145
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,110
superposition which is the way that we
talk about the physics intuition of

1146
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,120
talk about the physics intuition of
 

1147
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,190
talk about the physics intuition of
linearity right the most basic thing

1148
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200
linearity right the most basic thing
 

1149
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,870
linearity right the most basic thing
about linearity is that linearity allows

1150
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
about linearity is that linearity allows
 

1151
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,269
about linearity is that linearity allows
for superposition and the most basic

1152
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
for superposition and the most basic
 

1153
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,710
for superposition and the most basic
conceptual thing that happens with the

1154
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:14,720
conceptual thing that happens with the
 

1155
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,909
conceptual thing that happens with the
chain rule is that the derivatives

1156
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:17,919
chain rule is that the derivatives
 

1157
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,669
chain rule is that the derivatives
kind of are linear local linear

1158
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:19,679
kind of are linear local linear
 

1159
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,830
kind of are linear local linear
operators because they're local linear

1160
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
operators because they're local linear
 

1161
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,710
operators because they're local linear
operators they obey superposition so yes

1162
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
operators they obey superposition so yes
 

1163
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,630
operators they obey superposition so yes
this is indeed a direct consequence of

1164
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
this is indeed a direct consequence of
 

1165
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,510
this is indeed a direct consequence of
the idea of superposition

1166
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
the idea of superposition
 

1167
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,789
the idea of superposition
okay so Any more questions before I come

1168
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
okay so Any more questions before I come
 

1169
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,430
okay so Any more questions before I come
back to the another deeper level

1170
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
back to the another deeper level
 

1171
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,789
back to the another deeper level
question on the averaging?

1172
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:40,799

 

1173
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,190

Okay. So now let's just think about this

1174
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
Okay. So now let's just think about this
 

1175
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,950
Okay. So now let's just think about this
uh averaging

1176
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
uh averaging
 

1177
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,750
uh averaging
question. So

1178
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:47,760
question. So
 

1179
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,669
question. So
do you want to comment about why you

1180
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:49,679
do you want to comment about why you
 

1181
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,549
do you want to comment about why you
thought why your intuition was saying

1182
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
thought why your intuition was saying
 

1183
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,789
thought why your intuition was saying
that averaging might be something useful

1184
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:54,799
that averaging might be something useful
 

1185
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,950
that averaging might be something useful
or important or or do you just simply

1186
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
or important or or do you just simply
 

1187
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,549
or important or or do you just simply
think why there's summing there's

1188
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559
think why there's summing there's
 

1189
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,350
think why there's summing there's
averaging why is it one or the other? W

1190
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
averaging why is it one or the other? W
 

1191
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,470
averaging why is it one or the other? W
told those are all equal to each other.

1192
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
told those are all equal to each other.
 

1193
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,990
told those are all equal to each other.
>> Okay. So that because they're equal to

1194
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
>> Okay. So that because they're equal to
 

1195
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,669
>> Okay. So that because they're equal to
each other, you're thinking ah so you're

1196
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
each other, you're thinking ah so you're
 

1197
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,990
each other, you're thinking ah so you're
thinking of averaging in the sense of uh

1198
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
thinking of averaging in the sense of uh
 

1199
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,350
thinking of averaging in the sense of uh
I have many things that are equal to

1200
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,360
I have many things that are equal to
 

1201
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,029
I have many things that are equal to
each other. Uh they should be equal to

1202
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039
each other. Uh they should be equal to
 

1203
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,470
each other. Uh they should be equal to
each other. I'm getting something which

1204
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
each other. I'm getting something which
 

1205
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,310
each other. I'm getting something which
is different. The way I combine

1206
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,320
is different. The way I combine
 

1207
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,070
is different. The way I combine
different estimates for something that

1208
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,080
different estimates for something that
 

1209
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,710
different estimates for something that
should be the same is averaging. Okay,

1210
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:20,720
should be the same is averaging. Okay,
 

1211
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,909
should be the same is averaging. Okay,
that's a a good intuition. Um turns out

1212
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:23,919
that's a a good intuition. Um turns out
 

1213
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,430
that's a a good intuition. Um turns out
not to be the right mathematical one in

1214
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,440
not to be the right mathematical one in
 

1215
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,750
not to be the right mathematical one in
this case as we talked about. But

1216
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
this case as we talked about. But
 

1217
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,430
this case as we talked about. But
there's another reason why you might be

1218
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:29,440
there's another reason why you might be
 

1219
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,549
there's another reason why you might be
thinking about averaging. Um, and this

1220
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
thinking about averaging. Um, and this
 

1221
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,549
thinking about averaging. Um, and this
is relevant. So in the context of

1222
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
is relevant. So in the context of
 

1223
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,710
is relevant. So in the context of
a neural net implemented on

1224
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:40,720
a neural net implemented on
 

1225
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,590
a neural net implemented on
finite precision arithmetic,

1226
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
finite precision arithmetic,
 

1227
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,909
finite precision arithmetic,
there's a question when you start

1228
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
there's a question when you start
 

1229
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,590
there's a question when you start
averaging when you start adding things

1230
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
averaging when you start adding things
 

1231
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,990
averaging when you start adding things
up, right? Even if these are all

1232
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,000
up, right? Even if these are all
 

1233
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,990
up, right? Even if these are all
different from each other. So suppose

1234
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
different from each other. So suppose
 

1235
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,430
different from each other. So suppose
all of these were actually behaving in

1236
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,440
all of these were actually behaving in
 

1237
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,909
all of these were actually behaving in
an uncorrelated manner, right? They're

1238
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:55,919
an uncorrelated manner, right? They're
 

1239
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,590
an uncorrelated manner, right? They're
just happen to be as though they're

1240
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
just happen to be as though they're
 

1241
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,669
just happen to be as though they're
random.

1242
00:26:59,669 --> 00:26:59,679
random.
 

1243
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,430
random.
What is this? How does the scale of this

1244
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440
What is this? How does the scale of this
 

1245
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,870
What is this? How does the scale of this
grow with the number of terms in this

1246
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:02,880
grow with the number of terms in this
 

1247
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,110
grow with the number of terms in this
sum?

1248
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
sum?
 

1249
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,190
sum?
Do you understand the question? Maybe

1250
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
Do you understand the question? Maybe
 

1251
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,470
Do you understand the question? Maybe
take a minute to talk to your neighbors

1252
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
take a minute to talk to your neighbors
 

1253
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,750
take a minute to talk to your neighbors
about if if these were uncorrelated or

1254
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:13,760
about if if these were uncorrelated or
 

1255
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,190
about if if these were uncorrelated or
pointing in the same direction, both

1256
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200
pointing in the same direction, both
 

1257
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,669
pointing in the same direction, both
separate cases, how does the scale of

1258
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
separate cases, how does the scale of
 

1259
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,590
separate cases, how does the scale of
this change with the number of terms in

1260
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:19,600
this change with the number of terms in
 

1261
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,310
this change with the number of terms in
this sum?

1262
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
this sum?
 

1263
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,909
this sum?
So,

1264
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:23,919
So,
 

1265
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:53,669
So,
take a little time to think.

1266
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679

 

1267
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:24,710

Hi.

1268
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:24,720

 

1269
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,110

Okay.

1270
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
Okay.
 

1271
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,470
Okay.
So, spent a minute. So, does anyone want

1272
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,480
So, spent a minute. So, does anyone want
 

1273
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,310
So, spent a minute. So, does anyone want
to volunteer an answer? If I'm if I'm

1274
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
to volunteer an answer? If I'm if I'm
 

1275
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,470
to volunteer an answer? If I'm if I'm
averaging things like this, I'm sort of

1276
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:34,480
averaging things like this, I'm sort of
 

1277
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,789
averaging things like this, I'm sort of
adding up things like this. How does the

1278
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:36,799
adding up things like this. How does the
 

1279
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,669
adding up things like this. How does the
scale typically if it was random, how

1280
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:39,679
scale typically if it was random, how
 

1281
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,549
scale typically if it was random, how
would the scale change?

1282
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:42,559
would the scale change?
 

1283
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,230
would the scale change?
Suppose there's 100 things in this sum.

1284
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
Suppose there's 100 things in this sum.
 

1285
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,789
Suppose there's 100 things in this sum.
>> Yeah.

1286
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:46,799
>> Yeah.
 

1287
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,750
>> Yeah.
>> Well, we're assuming that they're

1288
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:47,760
>> Well, we're assuming that they're
 

1289
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,269
>> Well, we're assuming that they're
roughly uncorrelated, then you could

1290
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,279
roughly uncorrelated, then you could
 

1291
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,950
roughly uncorrelated, then you could
describe them as having a variance that

1292
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
describe them as having a variance that
 

1293
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,710
describe them as having a variance that
grows at an order of like I guess and it

1294
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:56,720
grows at an order of like I guess and it
 

1295
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,149
grows at an order of like I guess and it
grows linearly with the number of

1296
00:28:58,149 --> 00:28:58,159
grows linearly with the number of
 

1297
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,830
grows linearly with the number of
samples at least the standard deviation

1298
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:01,840
samples at least the standard deviation
 

1299
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,269
samples at least the standard deviation
so variance grow

1300
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:03,279
so variance grow
 

1301
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,630
so variance grow
>> yeah so variance will grow if they were

1302
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:04,640
>> yeah so variance will grow if they were
 

1303
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,149
>> yeah so variance will grow if they were
uncorrelated the variance would grow

1304
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
uncorrelated the variance would grow
 

1305
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,430
uncorrelated the variance would grow
with the number of terms of sum which

1306
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,440
with the number of terms of sum which
 

1307
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,549
with the number of terms of sum which
means the standard deviation which is

1308
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
means the standard deviation which is
 

1309
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,950
means the standard deviation which is
the scale that you expect to see grows

1310
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:10,960
the scale that you expect to see grows
 

1311
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,269
the scale that you expect to see grows
like square root so if there's a 100

1312
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:13,279
like square root so if there's a 100
 

1313
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,269
like square root so if there's a 100
things in this sum you expect the scale

1314
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:15,279
things in this sum you expect the scale
 

1315
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,750
things in this sum you expect the scale
of things to grow by 10

1316
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
of things to grow by 10
 

1317
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,389
of things to grow by 10
as an example if they were all pointing

1318
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:20,399
as an example if they were all pointing
 

1319
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,789
as an example if they were all pointing
in the same direction correlated then

1320
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799
in the same direction correlated then
 

1321
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,350
in the same direction correlated then
you would expect the scale to grow as by

1322
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
you would expect the scale to grow as by
 

1323
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,830
you would expect the scale to grow as by
a factor of 100

1324
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,840
a factor of 100
 

1325
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,269
a factor of 100
the real life will be something in

1326
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
the real life will be something in
 

1327
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,590
the real life will be something in
between uh these cases. So what does

1328
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:33,600
between uh these cases. So what does
 

1329
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,149
between uh these cases. So what does
that mean practically? It means that in

1330
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:36,159
that mean practically? It means that in
 

1331
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,470
that mean practically? It means that in
connets because what does the sum look

1332
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:38,480
connets because what does the sum look
 

1333
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,549
connets because what does the sum look
like in connets? This is sharing over

1334
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:40,559
like in connets? This is sharing over
 

1335
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,590
like in connets? This is sharing over
all the places that filter is applying

1336
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
all the places that filter is applying
 

1337
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,470
all the places that filter is applying
which for an image is roughly if it's a

1338
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,480
which for an image is roughly if it's a
 

1339
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,789
which for an image is roughly if it's a
250 x 250 image that's basically 250*

1340
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:50,799
250 x 250 image that's basically 250*
 

1341
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,149
250 x 250 image that's basically 250*
250

1342
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:52,159
250
 

1343
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,789
250
So the scale can grow by a factor of

1344
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
So the scale can grow by a factor of
 

1345
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,950
So the scale can grow by a factor of
250.

1346
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:56,960
250.
 

1347
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,230
250.
Does everyone see that? Okay. This is an

1348
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,240
Does everyone see that? Okay. This is an
 

1349
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,149
Does everyone see that? Okay. This is an
important thing when it comes to

1350
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
important thing when it comes to
 

1351
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,870
important thing when it comes to
thinking about the gradients in a

1352
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:04,880
thinking about the gradients in a
 

1353
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,510
thinking about the gradients in a
convent. And from this point of view,

1354
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:07,520
convent. And from this point of view,
 

1355
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,990
convent. And from this point of view,
your averaging question can also be

1356
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,000
your averaging question can also be
 

1357
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,909
your averaging question can also be
interpreted as coming from an intuition

1358
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:11,919
interpreted as coming from an intuition
 

1359
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,950
interpreted as coming from an intuition
of being wary of sums that might make

1360
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
of being wary of sums that might make
 

1361
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,750
of being wary of sums that might make
things grow and thinking maybe an

1362
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,760
things grow and thinking maybe an
 

1363
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,590
things grow and thinking maybe an
average would be better because then it

1364
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,600
average would be better because then it
 

1365
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,669
average would be better because then it
would keep the scale uh at the same

1366
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:21,679
would keep the scale uh at the same
 

1367
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,590
would keep the scale uh at the same
scale.

1368
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:23,600
scale.
 

1369
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,070
scale.
So typically when we're working with uh

1370
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,080
So typically when we're working with uh
 

1371
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,510
So typically when we're working with uh
floatingoint numbers and we're doing

1372
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:29,520
floatingoint numbers and we're doing
 

1373
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,389
floatingoint numbers and we're doing
FP32 computations in floatingoint

1374
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:32,399
FP32 computations in floatingoint
 

1375
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,470
FP32 computations in floatingoint
standard float, this turns out not to be

1376
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,480
standard float, this turns out not to be
 

1377
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,549
standard float, this turns out not to be
that big of a deal. You have enough

1378
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:36,559
that big of a deal. You have enough
 

1379
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,830
that big of a deal. You have enough
dynamic range uh to worry about this.

1380
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:39,840
dynamic range uh to worry about this.
 

1381
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,909
dynamic range uh to worry about this.
But when one starts doing computations

1382
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:41,919
But when one starts doing computations
 

1383
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,470
But when one starts doing computations
in increasingly smaller precisions. So

1384
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
in increasingly smaller precisions. So
 

1385
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,389
in increasingly smaller precisions. So
the homework this time you see there's a

1386
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399
the homework this time you see there's a
 

1387
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,830
the homework this time you see there's a
homework problem that asks you to engage

1388
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:47,840
homework problem that asks you to engage
 

1389
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,230
homework problem that asks you to engage
with how MUP scaling works when you

1390
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,240
with how MUP scaling works when you
 

1391
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,909
with how MUP scaling works when you
might be thinking about MUP scaling with

1392
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:51,919
might be thinking about MUP scaling with
 

1393
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,750
might be thinking about MUP scaling with
FP8

1394
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:53,760
FP8
 

1395
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,389
FP8
right which is eight 8bit uh floats. So

1396
00:30:58,389 --> 00:30:58,399
right which is eight 8bit uh floats. So
 

1397
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,149
right which is eight 8bit uh floats. So
in once you're getting 8 bit floats

1398
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
in once you're getting 8 bit floats
 

1399
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,230
in once you're getting 8 bit floats
especially and a little bit in 16 too

1400
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,240
especially and a little bit in 16 too
 

1401
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,149
especially and a little bit in 16 too
then you do have to worry about this and

1402
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:04,159
then you do have to worry about this and
 

1403
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,110
then you do have to worry about this and
think about how to structure this

1404
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
think about how to structure this
 

1405
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,789
think about how to structure this
computation in such a way that you don't

1406
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:08,799
computation in such a way that you don't
 

1407
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,870
computation in such a way that you don't
get uh things to happen. One of the

1408
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
get uh things to happen. One of the
 

1409
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,149
get uh things to happen. One of the
approaches that people do is something

1410
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:12,159
approaches that people do is something
 

1411
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,470
approaches that people do is something
called mixed precision training which

1412
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:14,480
called mixed precision training which
 

1413
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,389
called mixed precision training which
they will keep the middle intermediate

1414
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:16,399
they will keep the middle intermediate
 

1415
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,029
they will keep the middle intermediate
results in a another precision a higher

1416
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:19,039
results in a another precision a higher
 

1417
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,190
results in a another precision a higher
precision to keep track of the results.

1418
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,200
precision to keep track of the results.
 

1419
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,310
precision to keep track of the results.
Okay. So just wanted to acknowledge this

1420
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,320
Okay. So just wanted to acknowledge this
 

1421
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,230
Okay. So just wanted to acknowledge this
uh because certainly in modern

if you run them in FP16 or FP8 as

1430
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,200
if you run them in FP16 or FP8 as
 

1431
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,789
if you run them in FP16 or FP8 as
opposed to running them in FP32. almost

1432
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:36,799
opposed to running them in FP32. almost
 

1433
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,909
opposed to running them in FP32. almost
like four times faster in FP8 than if

1434
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
like four times faster in FP8 than if
 

1435
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,830
like four times faster in FP8 than if
you run it in FP32. You will want it's

1436
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
you run it in FP32. You will want it's
 

1437
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,909
you run it in FP32. You will want it's
worth keeping track of these things uh

1438
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:45,919
worth keeping track of these things uh
 

1439
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,750
worth keeping track of these things uh
sometimes.

1440
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
sometimes.
 

1441
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,350
sometimes.
Okay, so any other comments on backrop

1442
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,360
Okay, so any other comments on backrop
 

1443
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,470
Okay, so any other comments on backrop
here? Questions people have? Okay, so

1444
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,480
here? Questions people have? Okay, so
 

1445
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,389
here? Questions people have? Okay, so
now we're going to move on and talk

1446
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399
now we're going to move on and talk
 

1447
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,990
now we're going to move on and talk
about pooling.

1448
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,000

 

1449
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,509

So we talked about uh

1450
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
So we talked about uh
 

1451
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,070
So we talked about uh
so far we talked about downsampling

1452
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,080
so far we talked about downsampling
 

1453
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,310
so far we talked about downsampling
using stride. So stride is pretty

1454
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
using stride. So stride is pretty
 

1455
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,789
using stride. So stride is pretty
simple. Remember stride said we're going

1456
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:10,799
simple. Remember stride said we're going
 

1457
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,389
simple. Remember stride said we're going
to down sample to move to a lower

1458
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:12,399
to down sample to move to a lower
 

1459
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,909
to down sample to move to a lower
resolution by keeping only one out of

1460
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:15,919
resolution by keeping only one out of
 

1461
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,230
resolution by keeping only one out of
four and we'll keep one out of four by

1462
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,240
four and we'll keep one out of four by
 

1463
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,990
four and we'll keep one out of four by
always keeping this one.

1464
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,000
always keeping this one.
 

1465
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,149
always keeping this one.
Okay. So you could conceptually you

1466
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:24,159
Okay. So you could conceptually you
 

1467
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,590
Okay. So you could conceptually you
could compute the whole thing and then

1468
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,600
could compute the whole thing and then
 

1469
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,870
could compute the whole thing and then
just keep one out of four or you could

1470
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:28,880
just keep one out of four or you could
 

1471
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,789
just keep one out of four or you could
say I'm not even going to bother

1472
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:30,799
say I'm not even going to bother
 

1473
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,310
say I'm not even going to bother
computing the things that I'm never

1474
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:32,320
computing the things that I'm never
 

1475
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,149
computing the things that I'm never
going to keep and use the idea of

1476
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:34,159
going to keep and use the idea of
 

1477
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,909
going to keep and use the idea of
stride. Move your filter by two in this

1478
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:37,919
stride. Move your filter by two in this
 

1479
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,750
stride. Move your filter by two in this
case. So this should be clear everyone

1480
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
case. So this should be clear everyone
 

1481
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,909
case. So this should be clear everyone
and for this case again there's no real

1482
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:43,919
and for this case again there's no real
 

1483
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,990
and for this case again there's no real
issue with thinking about back prop.

1484
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,000
issue with thinking about back prop.
 

1485
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,389
issue with thinking about back prop.
It's pretty straightforward.

1486
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:48,399
It's pretty straightforward.
 

1487
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,509
It's pretty straightforward.
But there's other ways of downsampling.

1488
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:51,519
But there's other ways of downsampling.
 

1489
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,750
But there's other ways of downsampling.
Two of them are max pooling and mean

1490
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:55,760
Two of them are max pooling and mean
 

1491
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,630
Two of them are max pooling and mean
pooling. So mean pooling means just take

1492
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:58,640
pooling. So mean pooling means just take
 

1493
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,110
pooling. So mean pooling means just take
the local averages. So take whatever is

1494
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,120
the local averages. So take whatever is
 

1495
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,950
the local averages. So take whatever is
in here and average them together to get

1496
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:02,960
in here and average them together to get
 

1497
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,509
in here and average them together to get
a single number. Whatever is here,

1498
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
a single number. Whatever is here,
 

1499
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,430
a single number. Whatever is here,
average together, get a single number

1500
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,440
average together, get a single number
 

1501
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,509
average together, get a single number
and so on. Again, should be pretty

1502
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
and so on. Again, should be pretty
 

1503
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,430
and so on. Again, should be pretty
conceptually straightforward what's

1504
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:11,440
conceptually straightforward what's
 

1505
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,909
conceptually straightforward what's
happening here.

1506
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:13,919
happening here.
 

1507
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,190
happening here.
Uh terms of equations, you take the

1508
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,200
Uh terms of equations, you take the
 

1509
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,590
Uh terms of equations, you take the
output, it's whatever your pooling

1510
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,600
output, it's whatever your pooling
 

1511
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,470
output, it's whatever your pooling
domain is. So in this case it's a 2x two

1512
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
domain is. So in this case it's a 2x two
 

1513
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,950
domain is. So in this case it's a 2x two
little pooling domain

1514
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:24,960
little pooling domain
 

1515
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,870
little pooling domain
average over it. Everyone clear with

1516
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
average over it. Everyone clear with
 

1517
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,149
average over it. Everyone clear with
mean pooling?

1518
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:28,159
mean pooling?
 

1519
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:28,710
mean pooling?
>> Yeah.

1520
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:28,720
>> Yeah.
 

1521
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,190
>> Yeah.
>> Is just equivalent to having your

1522
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,200
>> Is just equivalent to having your
 

1523
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,549
>> Is just equivalent to having your
convolution be a flat one size?

1524
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:34,559
convolution be a flat one size?
 

1525
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,870
convolution be a flat one size?
>> Excellent question. Is mean pooling the

1526
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
>> Excellent question. Is mean pooling the
 

1527
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,029
>> Excellent question. Is mean pooling the
same as having a convolution that's a

1528
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
same as having a convolution that's a
 

1529
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,909
same as having a convolution that's a
flat one over size with a stride that

1530
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:41,919
flat one over size with a stride that
 

1531
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,870
flat one over size with a stride that
matches here?

1532
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:42,880
matches here?
 

1533
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,430
matches here?
>> Yeah.

1534
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:43,440
>> Yeah.
 

1535
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,950
>> Yeah.
>> Right. Adding another convolutional

1536
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:44,960
>> Right. Adding another convolutional
 

1537
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,070
>> Right. Adding another convolutional
layer that does that. And the answer is

1538
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,080
layer that does that. And the answer is
 

1539
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,110
layer that does that. And the answer is
yes. It's exactly the same.

1540
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,120

 

1541
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,909

So you can think about this as being

1542
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919
So you can think about this as being
 

1543
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,950
So you can think about this as being
this plus another conler with with

1544
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:56,960
this plus another conler with with
 

1545
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,669
this plus another conler with with
non-learnable parameters.

1546
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
non-learnable parameters.
 

1547
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,950
non-learnable parameters.
So everyone's good. So again back prop

1548
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:02,960
So everyone's good. So again back prop
 

1549
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,110
So everyone's good. So again back prop
for this pretty straightforward.

1550
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
for this pretty straightforward.
 

1551
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,630
for this pretty straightforward.
Effectively what happens is whatever

1552
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:06,640
Effectively what happens is whatever
 

1553
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,950
Effectively what happens is whatever
gradient was hitting this

1554
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:08,960
gradient was hitting this
 

1555
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,790
gradient was hitting this
one quarter of that will hit each of

1556
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:10,800
one quarter of that will hit each of
 

1557
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,550
one quarter of that will hit each of
these positions because of this

1558
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:14,560
these positions because of this
 

1559
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,470
these positions because of this
one quarter.

1560
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:16,480
one quarter.
 

1561
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,629
one quarter.
Okay. Now that leaves the

1562
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
Okay. Now that leaves the
 

1563
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,149
Okay. Now that leaves the
other case is called max pooling.

1564
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:24,159
other case is called max pooling.
 

1565
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,629
other case is called max pooling.
So max pooling says that

1566
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:28,639
So max pooling says that
 

1567
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,869
So max pooling says that
I'm going to combine these four numbers

1568
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879
I'm going to combine these four numbers
 

1569
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,349
I'm going to combine these four numbers
not by averaging but by taking a max

1570
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:35,359
not by averaging but by taking a max
 

1571
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,109
not by averaging but by taking a max
whichever is the biggest one I'll pass

1572
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:37,119
whichever is the biggest one I'll pass
 

1573
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,230
whichever is the biggest one I'll pass
that forward. So intuition behind max

1574
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,240
that forward. So intuition behind max
 

1575
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,470
that forward. So intuition behind max
pooling is again thinking about the idea

1576
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:42,480
pooling is again thinking about the idea
 

1577
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,710
pooling is again thinking about the idea
of a dog detector, a cat detector or a

1578
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:44,720
of a dog detector, a cat detector or a
 

1579
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,710
of a dog detector, a cat detector or a
hand detector or a you know finger

1580
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:46,720
hand detector or a you know finger
 

1581
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,669
hand detector or a you know finger
detector. And the idea is that I want to

1582
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:49,679
detector. And the idea is that I want to
 

1583
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,230
detector. And the idea is that I want to
know if there was a finger in this

1584
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,240
know if there was a finger in this
 

1585
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,950
know if there was a finger in this
place. So when I move my filter at

1586
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:54,960
place. So when I move my filter at
 

1587
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,390
place. So when I move my filter at
different places, this one said okay

1588
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:58,400
different places, this one said okay
 

1589
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,470
different places, this one said okay
yeah there was really a lot of finger

1590
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480
yeah there was really a lot of finger
 

1591
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,630
yeah there was really a lot of finger
here. Not very much finger maybe a

1592
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
here. Not very much finger maybe a
 

1593
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,790
here. Not very much finger maybe a
little bit something. So the idea is

1594
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
little bit something. So the idea is
 

1595
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,349
little bit something. So the idea is
that how should you represent the entire

1596
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:07,359
that how should you represent the entire
 

1597
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,750
that how should you represent the entire
domain from a finger detector point of

1598
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:09,760
domain from a finger detector point of
 

1599
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,109
domain from a finger detector point of
view and Max says well if there's a

1600
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,119
view and Max says well if there's a
 

1601
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,910
view and Max says well if there's a
finger anywhere in there's a finger here

1602
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:13,920
finger anywhere in there's a finger here
 

1603
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,069
finger anywhere in there's a finger here
everyone see that kind of intuition

1604
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:16,079
everyone see that kind of intuition
 

1605
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,950
everyone see that kind of intuition
that's the intuition behind max pooling

1606
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:18,960
that's the intuition behind max pooling
 

1607
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,230
that's the intuition behind max pooling
you just take the max

1608
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,240
you just take the max
 

1609
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,710
you just take the max
okay again operation is very clear

1610
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
okay again operation is very clear
 

1611
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,550
okay again operation is very clear
output is max over the pooling domain of

1612
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:26,560
output is max over the pooling domain of
 

1613
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,349
output is max over the pooling domain of
hi

1614
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:29,359
hi
 

1615
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,230
hi
now the question is just back prop for

1616
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,240
now the question is just back prop for
 

1617
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,910
now the question is just back prop for
that

1618
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:35,920

 

1619
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,470

Back up here was straightforward. Back

1620
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,480
Back up here was straightforward. Back
 

1621
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,470
Back up here was straightforward. Back
up here is straightforward. Back prop

1622
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
up here is straightforward. Back prop
 

1623
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,670
up here is straightforward. Back prop
here has a couple worth a little

1624
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:43,680
here has a couple worth a little
 

1625
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,310
here has a couple worth a little
comment. So what's the comment? The

1626
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,320
comment. So what's the comment? The
 

1627
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,069
comment. So what's the comment? The
comment is you have a max operation

1628
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:50,079
comment is you have a max operation
 

1629
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,710
comment is you have a max operation
and the max operation behaves an

1630
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:52,720
and the max operation behaves an
 

1631
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,030
and the max operation behaves an
interesting way which is that

1632
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040

 

1633
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,950

this six is the same as this six. Does

1634
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:02,960
this six is the same as this six. Does
 

1635
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,270
this six is the same as this six. Does
everyone see that? So here's the

1636
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,280
everyone see that? So here's the
 

1637
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,550
everyone see that? So here's the
question. If this one were to change a

1638
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:08,560
question. If this one were to change a
 

1639
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,630
question. If this one were to change a
little bit,

1640
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:10,640
little bit,
 

1641
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,910
little bit,
what would happen here?

1642
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:13,920
what would happen here?
 

1643
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,950
what would happen here?
Everyone understand the question? That's

1644
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:14,960
Everyone understand the question? That's
 

1645
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,230
Everyone understand the question? That's
what gradients are doing, right? If this

1646
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,240
what gradients are doing, right? If this
 

1647
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,589
what gradients are doing, right? If this
were to change a little bit, what

1648
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:17,599
were to change a little bit, what
 

1649
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,910
were to change a little bit, what
happens? So, if this one were to change

1650
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:19,920
happens? So, if this one were to change
 

1651
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,790
happens? So, if this one were to change
a little bit, what happens here?

1652
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:22,800
a little bit, what happens here?
 

1653
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,510
a little bit, what happens here?
>> Nothing.

1654
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
>> Nothing.
 

1655
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,870
>> Nothing.
>> Nothing. Because it wasn't the max. If

1656
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:26,880
>> Nothing. Because it wasn't the max. If
 

1657
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,870
>> Nothing. Because it wasn't the max. If
the six changed a little bit, then

1658
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:28,880
the six changed a little bit, then
 

1659
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,030
the six changed a little bit, then
something would happen. But if anything

1660
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,040
something would happen. But if anything
 

1661
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,790
something would happen. But if anything
else changed, nothing happens.

1662
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:34,800
else changed, nothing happens.
 

1663
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,589
else changed, nothing happens.
Everyone with me? The only case that's

1664
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:37,599
Everyone with me? The only case that's
 

1665
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,430
Everyone with me? The only case that's
different is a tie. And basically,

1666
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:39,440
different is a tie. And basically,
 

1667
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,550
different is a tie. And basically,
there'll never be ties.

1668
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:44,560

 

1669
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,150

So

1670
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,160
So
 

1671
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,870
So
you can think of it this way that the

1672
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:48,880
you can think of it this way that the
 

1673
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,550
you can think of it this way that the
max pool operation when viewed forward

1674
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:52,560
max pool operation when viewed forward
 

1675
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,630
max pool operation when viewed forward
is taking maxes

1676
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:54,640
is taking maxes
 

1677
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,630
is taking maxes
on the back prop side. When things are

1678
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:56,640
on the back prop side. When things are
 

1679
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,109
on the back prop side. When things are
coming back, it's routing the gradients.

1680
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:01,119
coming back, it's routing the gradients.
 

1681
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,710
coming back, it's routing the gradients.
So it's taking whatever gradient was

1682
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:02,720
So it's taking whatever gradient was
 

1683
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,030
So it's taking whatever gradient was
here and it's sending all of it to this

1684
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,040
here and it's sending all of it to this
 

1685
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,270
here and it's sending all of it to this
position. It's sending none of it to

1686
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,280
position. It's sending none of it to
 

1687
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:28,630
position. It's sending none of it to
these other positions.

1688
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:28,640

 

1689
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,270

So it follows the arg max,

1690
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,280
So it follows the arg max,
 

1691
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,109
So it follows the arg max,
right? The index that the arg max is,

1692
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
right? The index that the arg max is,
 

1693
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:45,109
right? The index that the arg max is,
that's where the gradient goes.

1694
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:45,119

 

1695
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,230

So this is max pool.

1696
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:50,240

 

1697
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,750

>> Okay

1698
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:51,760
>> Okay
 

1699
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,069
>> Okay
everyone question there any questions on

1700
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:54,079
everyone question there any questions on
 

1701
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,109
everyone question there any questions on
this? Yes.

1702
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119
this? Yes.
 

1703
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,430
this? Yes.
>> What if like the one has changed so

1704
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
>> What if like the one has changed so
 

1705
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,589
>> What if like the one has changed so
much?

1706
00:37:59,589 --> 00:37:59,599
much?
 

1707
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,750
much?
>> Excellent question. Question was what if

1708
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:01,760
>> Excellent question. Question was what if
 

1709
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,349
>> Excellent question. Question was what if
the one changes so much that it's bigger

1710
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
the one changes so much that it's bigger
 

1711
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,589
the one changes so much that it's bigger
than six. So this is the whole idea of

1712
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:05,599
than six. So this is the whole idea of
 

1713
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,030
than six. So this is the whole idea of
derivatives. They take a local

1714
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,040
derivatives. They take a local
 

1715
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,109
derivatives. They take a local
perspective. They assume that things are

1716
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:09,119
perspective. They assume that things are
 

1717
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,109
perspective. They assume that things are
only going to change a little bit. Why

1718
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:11,119
only going to change a little bit. Why
 

1719
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,230
only going to change a little bit. Why
would they only change a little bit?

1720
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:12,240
would they only change a little bit?
 

1721
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,829
would they only change a little bit?
Because after I do a gradient update,

1722
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:13,839
Because after I do a gradient update,
 

1723
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,430
Because after I do a gradient update,
I'm just going to update the weights a

1724
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:15,440
I'm just going to update the weights a
 

1725
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,910
I'm just going to update the weights a
little bit. And so the one won't change

1726
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:17,920
little bit. And so the one won't change
 

1727
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,109
little bit. And so the one won't change
by a lot. So I'll just route the

1728
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:21,119
by a lot. So I'll just route the
 

1729
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,670
by a lot. So I'll just route the
gradient only here.

1730
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:27,680

 

1731
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,470

So this is max pooling.

1732
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:30,480
So this is max pooling.
 

1733
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,190
So this is max pooling.
Okay. Now what I want to do before I

1734
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,200
Okay. Now what I want to do before I
 

1735
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,349
Okay. Now what I want to do before I
move on to other topics just talk a

1736
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:35,359
move on to other topics just talk a
 

1737
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,589
move on to other topics just talk a
little bit about like the historical

1738
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:37,599
little bit about like the historical
 

1739
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,950
little bit about like the historical
like how this stuff was put together

1740
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:38,960
like how this stuff was put together
 

1741
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,069
like how this stuff was put together
because now you have all the ingredients

1742
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:40,079
because now you have all the ingredients
 

1743
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,710
because now you have all the ingredients
of a basic old school connet.

1744
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:44,720
of a basic old school connet.
 

1745
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,109
of a basic old school connet.
And so this is Alex a picture of Alexet

1746
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:49,119
And so this is Alex a picture of Alexet
 

1747
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,310
And so this is Alex a picture of Alexet
which is from 2012 really kicked off the

1748
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,320
which is from 2012 really kicked off the
 

1749
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,990
which is from 2012 really kicked off the
modern golden age of neural nets.

1750
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,000
modern golden age of neural nets.
 

1751
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,710
modern golden age of neural nets.
you have an image and you see that the

1752
00:38:58,710 --> 00:38:58,720
you have an image and you see that the
 

1753
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,950
you have an image and you see that the
first thing you do is you have filters

1754
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:00,960
first thing you do is you have filters
 

1755
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,349
first thing you do is you have filters
that make it smaller,

1756
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:05,359
that make it smaller,
 

1757
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,470
that make it smaller,
you know. So in this case, uh it's a big

1758
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:08,480
you know. So in this case, uh it's a big
 

1759
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,589
you know. So in this case, uh it's a big
filter 55 uh by 55 and you have 96

1760
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:13,599
filter 55 uh by 55 and you have 96
 

1761
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,950
filter 55 uh by 55 and you have 96
channels of outputs. So you go from

1762
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:16,960
channels of outputs. So you go from
 

1763
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,790
channels of outputs. So you go from
original three channels to 96.

1764
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:20,800
original three channels to 96.
 

1765
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,270
original three channels to 96.
Then you move you do a max pool

1766
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,280
Then you move you do a max pool
 

1767
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,550
Then you move you do a max pool
and the max pool turns these uh 55 x 55s

1768
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:30,560
and the max pool turns these uh 55 x 55s
 

1769
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,069
and the max pool turns these uh 55 x 55s
into 27 by 27. Then you do 5x5 cons and

1770
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:34,079
into 27 by 27. Then you do 5x5 cons and
 

1771
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,550
into 27 by 27. Then you do 5x5 cons and
the 5x5 cons gets you to 256 channels

1772
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:40,560

 

1773
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,630

then another pooling and then 384

1774
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:44,640
then another pooling and then 384
 

1775
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,109
then another pooling and then 384
channels a couple of convolutional

1776
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:47,119
channels a couple of convolutional
 

1777
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,030
channels a couple of convolutional
layers. So now there's a comment I want

1778
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,040
layers. So now there's a comment I want
 

1779
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,150
layers. So now there's a comment I want
to make here is in this implementation.

1780
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,160
to make here is in this implementation.
 

1781
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,670
to make here is in this implementation.
So we've talked about convolution just

1782
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:53,680
So we've talked about convolution just
 

1783
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,870
So we've talked about convolution just
focusing on the linear part in the early

1784
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:56,880
focusing on the linear part in the early
 

1785
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,990
focusing on the linear part in the early
neural nets what you would do is after

1786
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,000
neural nets what you would do is after
 

1787
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,630
neural nets what you would do is after
you do the con and the bias you treat it

1788
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:02,640
you do the con and the bias you treat it
 

1789
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,190
you do the con and the bias you treat it
like you treat an MLP. So in the MLP

1790
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,200
like you treat an MLP. So in the MLP
 

1791
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,190
like you treat an MLP. So in the MLP
what do you do? You do a linear a bias

1792
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,200
what do you do? You do a linear a bias
 

1793
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,630
what do you do? You do a linear a bias
and then a nonlinearity component-wise.

1794
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:10,640
and then a nonlinearity component-wise.
 

1795
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,589
and then a nonlinearity component-wise.
So early connets follow the same recipe.

1796
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:13,599
So early connets follow the same recipe.
 

1797
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,950
So early connets follow the same recipe.
So every time you see uh a conve that

1798
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:16,960
So every time you see uh a conve that
 

1799
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,630
So every time you see uh a conve that
means a conve

1800
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:20,640

 

1801
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,710

nonlinearity.

1802
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:22,720
nonlinearity.
 

1803
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,790
nonlinearity.
So a nonlinearity happened here, nine

1804
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:24,800
So a nonlinearity happened here, nine
 

1805
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,790
So a nonlinearity happened here, nine
happened here, a nonlinearity here, nine

1806
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:26,800
happened here, a nonlinearity here, nine
 

1807
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,750
happened here, a nonlinearity here, nine
linearity here. And so what happens

1808
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:29,760
linearity here. And so what happens
 

1809
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,349
linearity here. And so what happens
after all of this is that

1810
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:33,359
after all of this is that
 

1811
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,710
after all of this is that
move this up a bit so you can see it

1812
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:34,720
move this up a bit so you can see it
 

1813
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,430
move this up a bit so you can see it
better.

1814
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:37,440
better.
 

1815
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,030
better.
Here you get a 13 by13

1816
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,040
Here you get a 13 by13
 

1817
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,510
Here you get a 13 by13
image from the original 224 x 224 and

1818
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:45,520
image from the original 224 x 224 and
 

1819
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,790
image from the original 224 x 224 and
this 13 by13 image has 256 channels in

1820
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:48,800
this 13 by13 image has 256 channels in
 

1821
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,790
this 13 by13 image has 256 channels in
it.

1822
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:52,800

 

1823
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,430

What you do is a little bit of max

1824
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
What you do is a little bit of max
 

1825
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,510
What you do is a little bit of max
pooling and then you turn this into two

1826
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
pooling and then you turn this into two
 

1827
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,950
pooling and then you turn this into two
4,96 numbers. At this point you no

1828
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960
4,96 numbers. At this point you no
 

1829
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,710
4,96 numbers. At this point you no
longer using con layers. You're going to

1830
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:04,720
longer using con layers. You're going to
 

1831
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,030
longer using con layers. You're going to
use fully connected layers. So this is

1832
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,040
use fully connected layers. So this is
 

1833
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,589
use fully connected layers. So this is
the style of old school um condents.

1834
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:09,599
the style of old school um condents.
 

1835
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,670
the style of old school um condents.
They would do some computation on the

1836
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:11,680
They would do some computation on the
 

1837
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,349
They would do some computation on the
image, make it smaller and smaller, make

1838
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:13,359
image, make it smaller and smaller, make
 

1839
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,829
image, make it smaller and smaller, make
a bunch of uh channels, then they'd

1840
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:15,839
a bunch of uh channels, then they'd
 

1841
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,950
a bunch of uh channels, then they'd
unroll the entire thing and do a little

1842
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:18,960
unroll the entire thing and do a little
 

1843
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,069
unroll the entire thing and do a little
uh MLP at the end with a soft max that

1844
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:22,079
uh MLP at the end with a soft max that
 

1845
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,390
uh MLP at the end with a soft max that
had a thousand categories that you're

1846
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
had a thousand categories that you're
 

1847
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,309
had a thousand categories that you're
classifying into.

1848
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:28,319

 

1849
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,150

Okay.

1850
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,160
Okay.
 

1851
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,109
Okay.
And yeah,

1852
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:35,119

 

1853
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,190

it

1854
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:37,200
it
 

1855
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,069
it
just filters together and apply that one

1856
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:40,079
just filters together and apply that one
 

1857
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,190
just filters together and apply that one
filter.

1858
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,200
filter.
 

1859
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,990
filter.
>> Excellent question. So the question was,

1860
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,000
>> Excellent question. So the question was,
 

1861
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,349
>> Excellent question. So the question was,
why would I ever do cons of the same

1862
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:47,359
why would I ever do cons of the same
 

1863
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,670
why would I ever do cons of the same
size over and over again? There's no

1864
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:49,680
size over and over again? There's no
 

1865
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,910
size over and over again? There's no
downsampling happening um one after the

1866
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:51,920
downsampling happening um one after the
 

1867
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,270
downsampling happening um one after the
other instead of just using a slightly

1868
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,280
other instead of just using a slightly
 

1869
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,430
other instead of just using a slightly
larger filter and doing it once. The

1870
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,440
larger filter and doing it once. The
 

1871
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,589
larger filter and doing it once. The
reason is that uh remember there's the

1872
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:57,599
reason is that uh remember there's the
 

1873
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,990
reason is that uh remember there's the
nonlinearity here. So it's for the

1874
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,000
nonlinearity here. So it's for the
 

1875
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,829
nonlinearity here. So it's for the
nonlinearity because you want to have

1876
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:01,839
nonlinearity because you want to have
 

1877
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,910
nonlinearity because you want to have
the expressive power of doing a linear

1878
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:03,920
the expressive power of doing a linear
 

1879
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,750
the expressive power of doing a linear
operation followed by a nonlinearity

1880
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:05,760
operation followed by a nonlinearity
 

1881
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,109
operation followed by a nonlinearity
followed by a linear operation followed

1882
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:07,119
followed by a linear operation followed
 

1883
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,710
followed by a linear operation followed
by nonlinearity and so on. That's why

1884
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:08,720
by nonlinearity and so on. That's why
 

1885
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,030
by nonlinearity and so on. That's why
it's happening.

1886
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,040

 

1887
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,270

And so what people did was they said

1888
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:15,280
And so what people did was they said
 

1889
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,390
And so what people did was they said
okay great um

1890
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:20,400

 

1891
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,510

this uh we can keep going. So a very

1892
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:23,520
this uh we can keep going. So a very
 

1893
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,109
this uh we can keep going. So a very
famous another very famous network from

1894
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:25,119
famous another very famous network from
 

1895
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,510
famous another very famous network from
2014 is VGG

1896
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:27,520
2014 is VGG
 

1897
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,950
2014 is VGG
and VGG has a structure that looks like

1898
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:30,960
and VGG has a structure that looks like
 

1899
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,510
and VGG has a structure that looks like
this

1900
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:33,520
this
 

1901
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,750
this
you know uh the details you can look in

1902
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:35,760
you know uh the details you can look in
 

1903
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,349
you know uh the details you can look in
prints for what's happening here but

1904
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:37,359
prints for what's happening here but
 

1905
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,030
prints for what's happening here but
it's the same kind of objects in the

1906
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,040
it's the same kind of objects in the
 

1907
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,069
it's the same kind of objects in the
same style just bigger

1908
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:42,079
same style just bigger
 

1909
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,589
same style just bigger
right there's more more layers

1910
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:45,599
right there's more more layers
 

1911
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,510
right there's more more layers
uh there's now this here you saw the

1912
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:49,520
uh there's now this here you saw the
 

1913
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,510
uh there's now this here you saw the
3x3s were like a few times Here you see

1914
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:53,520
3x3s were like a few times Here you see
 

1915
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,589
3x3s were like a few times Here you see
larger things are also a couple times

1916
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:55,599
larger things are also a couple times
 

1917
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,510
larger things are also a couple times
and then a few times repeated

1918
00:42:59,510 --> 00:42:59,520
and then a few times repeated
 

1919
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,069
and then a few times repeated
and so this had better performance and

1920
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:02,079
and so this had better performance and
 

1921
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,150
and so this had better performance and
actually very interestingly there's even

1922
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,160
actually very interestingly there's even
 

1923
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,390
actually very interestingly there's even
some modern applications today where

1924
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:06,400
some modern applications today where
 

1925
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,230
some modern applications today where
this this is archaic network from the

1926
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
this this is archaic network from the
 

1927
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,309
this this is archaic network from the
perspective of use for most

1928
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:10,319
perspective of use for most
 

1929
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,390
perspective of use for most
classification type applications but

1930
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:12,400
classification type applications but
 

1931
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,309
classification type applications but
there's certain applications which these

1932
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:14,319
there's certain applications which these
 

1933
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,829
there's certain applications which these
things are still um used

1934
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:17,839
things are still um used
 

1935
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,270
things are still um used
but we'll talk about those later

1936
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:21,280
but we'll talk about those later
 

1937
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,109
but we'll talk about those later
Okay, so this is this is the way these

1938
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:23,119
Okay, so this is this is the way these
 

1939
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,550
Okay, so this is this is the way these
networks are put together. Any questions

1940
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:24,560
networks are put together. Any questions
 

1941
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,750
networks are put together. Any questions
on this kind of putting it together? I

1942
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:25,760
on this kind of putting it together? I
 

1943
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,190
on this kind of putting it together? I
want to make sure we actually put things

1944
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:27,200
want to make sure we actually put things
 

1945
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,710
want to make sure we actually put things
together for a bit before moving on to

1946
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
together for a bit before moving on to
 

1947
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,510
together for a bit before moving on to
another topic.

1948
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:33,520

 

1949
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,550

Okay. And the homework will make you uh

1950
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:36,560
Okay. And the homework will make you uh
 

1951
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,270
Okay. And the homework will make you uh
do this.

1952
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:39,280
do this.
 

1953
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,829
do this.
So now I want to talk about data

1954
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:41,839
So now I want to talk about data
 

1955
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,190
So now I want to talk about data
augmentations. So changing topics.

1956
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,200
augmentations. So changing topics.
 

1957
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,069
augmentations. So changing topics.
So we talked about how the convolutional

1958
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:50,079
So we talked about how the convolutional
 

1959
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,710
So we talked about how the convolutional
architecture built in the idea of

1960
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:52,720
architecture built in the idea of
 

1961
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,829
architecture built in the idea of
translational invariance.

1962
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:55,839
translational invariance.
 

1963
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,910
translational invariance.
But there's also the question of how to

1964
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:57,920
But there's also the question of how to
 

1965
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,750
But there's also the question of how to
get other symmetries that you care

1966
00:43:59,750 --> 00:43:59,760
get other symmetries that you care
 

1967
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,349
get other symmetries that you care
about.

1968
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:01,359
about.
 

1969
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,069
about.
And the most natural one to think about

1970
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:04,079
And the most natural one to think about
 

1971
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,950
And the most natural one to think about
uh in the context of vision is little

1972
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:06,960
uh in the context of vision is little
 

1973
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,630
uh in the context of vision is little
rotations.

1974
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,640
rotations.
 

1975
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,390
rotations.
Did everyone see little rotations? You

1976
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,400
Did everyone see little rotations? You
 

1977
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,069
Did everyone see little rotations? You
want to make sure things are invariant

1978
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:12,079
want to make sure things are invariant
 

1979
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,990
want to make sure things are invariant
to little rotations.

1980
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
to little rotations.
 

1981
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,710
to little rotations.
So there's a problem. We don't have any

1982
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:16,720
So there's a problem. We don't have any
 

1983
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,430
So there's a problem. We don't have any
natural architecture by which weight

1984
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,440
natural architecture by which weight
 

1985
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,470
natural architecture by which weight
sharing alone will give us any kind of

1986
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:22,480
sharing alone will give us any kind of
 

1987
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,430
sharing alone will give us any kind of
invariance or type behavior to little

1988
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,440
invariance or type behavior to little
 

1989
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,670
invariance or type behavior to little
rotations. We just don't know how to do

1990
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:27,680
rotations. We just don't know how to do
 

1991
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,390
rotations. We just don't know how to do
that. So what do we do? One is you

1992
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,400
that. So what do we do? One is you
 

1993
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,790
that. So what do we do? One is you
expect that given enough data you expect

1994
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:34,800
expect that given enough data you expect
 

1995
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,990
expect that given enough data you expect
the data it should learn it itself.

1996
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,000
the data it should learn it itself.
 

1997
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,670
the data it should learn it itself.
But the other is the idea of data

1998
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:39,680
But the other is the idea of data
 

1999
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,349
But the other is the idea of data
augmentations.

2000
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:41,359
augmentations.
 

2001
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,230
augmentations.
The data augmentations say that when I'm

2002
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:44,240
The data augmentations say that when I'm
 

2003
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,190
The data augmentations say that when I'm
training on data, I don't train just on

2004
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,200
training on data, I don't train just on
 

2005
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,670
training on data, I don't train just on
the data I'm given. I train on

2006
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:49,680
the data I'm given. I train on
 

2007
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,829
the data I'm given. I train on
modifications of the data I'm given that

2008
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:51,839
modifications of the data I'm given that
 

2009
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,309
modifications of the data I'm given that
I believe should behave similarly. So I

2010
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
I believe should behave similarly. So I
 

2011
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,670
I believe should behave similarly. So I
add more diversity to my data by

2012
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:57,680
add more diversity to my data by
 

2013
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,150
add more diversity to my data by
injecting it myself.

2014
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,160
injecting it myself.
 

2015
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,710
injecting it myself.
And current best practice in vision

2016
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:02,720
And current best practice in vision
 

2017
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,670
And current best practice in vision
context especially is that for every

2018
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:05,680
context especially is that for every
 

2019
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,470
context especially is that for every
batch that you're using for training you

2020
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:08,480
batch that you're using for training you
 

2021
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,309
batch that you're using for training you
will actually apply an augmentation with

2022
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
will actually apply an augmentation with
 

2023
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,309
will actually apply an augmentation with
some probability.

2024
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:12,319
some probability.
 

2025
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,950
some probability.
And typically that means that during

2026
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:14,960
And typically that means that during
 

2027
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,630
And typically that means that during
training even if you're doing many epics

2028
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,640
training even if you're doing many epics
 

2029
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,710
training even if you're doing many epics
of training

2030
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:18,720
of training
 

2031
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,550
of training
you will never the network will never

2032
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,560
you will never the network will never
 

2033
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,349
you will never the network will never
actually see the same input twice. It'll

2034
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:23,359
actually see the same input twice. It'll
 

2035
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,710
actually see the same input twice. It'll
always see a different augmentation of

2036
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:24,720
always see a different augmentation of
 

2037
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,990
always see a different augmentation of
it.

2038
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,000
it.
 

2039
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,990
it.
So

2040
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,000
So
 

2041
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,870
So
this is uh code I've p pulled out of the

2042
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:30,880
this is uh code I've p pulled out of the
 

2043
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,829
this is uh code I've p pulled out of the
git repo for uh a particular very nice

2044
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
git repo for uh a particular very nice
 

2045
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,309
git repo for uh a particular very nice
paper called pixm mix.

2046
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:36,319
paper called pixm mix.
 

2047
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,030
paper called pixm mix.
Um HRIS the first author of this was

2048
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:39,040
Um HRIS the first author of this was
 

2049
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,470
Um HRIS the first author of this was
actually a grad student here. Um he now

2050
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:42,480
actually a grad student here. Um he now
 

2051
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,510
actually a grad student here. Um he now
uh leads major efforts on AI safety u

2052
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:45,520
uh leads major efforts on AI safety u
 

2053
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,550
uh leads major efforts on AI safety u
and the like and again the time is not

2054
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:48,560
and the like and again the time is not
 

2055
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,309
and the like and again the time is not
that long ago for this paper.

2056
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:52,319
that long ago for this paper.
 

2057
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,550
that long ago for this paper.
So there's uh a set of augmentations.

2058
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:56,560
So there's uh a set of augmentations.
 

2059
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,069
So there's uh a set of augmentations.
Can everyone see what's written here in

2060
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,079
Can everyone see what's written here in
 

2061
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,150
Can everyone see what's written here in
the back? Can you read the text? If not,

2062
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:00,160
the back? Can you read the text? If not,
 

2063
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,109
the back? Can you read the text? If not,
I'll zoom it up a bit. Okay. You can

2064
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:03,119
I'll zoom it up a bit. Okay. You can
 

2065
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,470
I'll zoom it up a bit. Okay. You can
kind of see what these are by their

2066
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:04,480
kind of see what these are by their
 

2067
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,069
kind of see what these are by their
names.

2068
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:06,079
names.
 

2069
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,230
names.
There's like changing the contrast and

2070
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:08,240
There's like changing the contrast and
 

2071
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,910
There's like changing the contrast and
brightness of things. There's making

2072
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:09,920
brightness of things. There's making
 

2073
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,630
brightness of things. There's making
things look like a poster. Uh there's

2074
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,640
things look like a poster. Uh there's
 

2075
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,390
things look like a poster. Uh there's
little translations in X and Y. You

2076
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
little translations in X and Y. You
 

2077
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,430
little translations in X and Y. You
might think, wait, doesn't the con

2078
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:15,440
might think, wait, doesn't the con
 

2079
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,349
might think, wait, doesn't the con
already give us that? But the philosophy

2080
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:17,359
already give us that? But the philosophy
 

2081
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,030
already give us that? But the philosophy
here is like add them in, see if they

2082
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:19,040
here is like add them in, see if they
 

2083
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,510
here is like add them in, see if they
help. They help. Okay, keep them.

2084
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:21,520
help. They help. Okay, keep them.
 

2085
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,270
help. They help. Okay, keep them.
um rotate, solarize, another kind of

2086
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:25,280
um rotate, solarize, another kind of
 

2087
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,390
um rotate, solarize, another kind of
contrast thing, shear like you know push

2088
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,400
contrast thing, shear like you know push
 

2089
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,430
contrast thing, shear like you know push
things over a little bit. Um

2090
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
things over a little bit. Um
 

2091
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,910
things over a little bit. Um
so these kind of uh augmentations one

2092
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:33,920
so these kind of uh augmentations one
 

2093
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,710
so these kind of uh augmentations one
can uh uh can use and there's like a

2094
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:36,720
can uh uh can use and there's like a
 

2095
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,790
can uh uh can use and there's like a
larger list of uh other other

2096
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:38,800
larger list of uh other other
 

2097
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,870
larger list of uh other other
augmentations. And so this list is the

2098
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:40,880
augmentations. And so this list is the
 

2099
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,510
augmentations. And so this list is the
one that this paper thought worked

2100
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:43,520
one that this paper thought worked
 

2101
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,829
one that this paper thought worked
better than having to use all of these.

2102
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
better than having to use all of these.
 

2103
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,349
better than having to use all of these.
Like the additional gain wasn't that

2104
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:47,359
Like the additional gain wasn't that
 

2105
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,710
Like the additional gain wasn't that
much. It was better to use more of these

2106
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:48,720
much. It was better to use more of these
 

2107
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,790
much. It was better to use more of these
more often.

2108
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:50,800
more often.
 

2109
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,349
more often.
So these kind of augmentations are the

2110
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:53,359
So these kind of augmentations are the
 

2111
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,349
So these kind of augmentations are the
augmentations that are you can think of

2112
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:55,359
augmentations that are you can think of
 

2113
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,990
augmentations that are you can think of
as building in

2114
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:58,000
as building in
 

2115
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,230
as building in
the invariances that you think should

2116
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:00,240
the invariances that you think should
 

2117
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,510
the invariances that you think should
should exist in the patterns you're

2118
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:01,520
should exist in the patterns you're
 

2119
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,470
should exist in the patterns you're
trying to learn. Does everyone

2120
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:02,480
trying to learn. Does everyone
 

2121
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,870
trying to learn. Does everyone
understand this? So basically have two

2122
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:04,880
understand this? So basically have two
 

2123
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,790
understand this? So basically have two
ideas two two things you can do. Augment

2124
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:06,800
ideas two two things you can do. Augment
 

2125
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,470
ideas two two things you can do. Augment
your data or build it into weight

2126
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:08,480
your data or build it into weight
 

2127
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,470
your data or build it into weight
sharing in the architecture to get the

2128
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:10,480
sharing in the architecture to get the
 

2129
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,630
sharing in the architecture to get the
inductive bias of your entire training.

2130
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:12,640
inductive bias of your entire training.
 

2131
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,430
inductive bias of your entire training.
So inductive bias is the word we use to

2132
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:15,440
So inductive bias is the word we use to
 

2133
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,550
So inductive bias is the word we use to
mean what is it the kinds of patterns

2134
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:18,560
mean what is it the kinds of patterns
 

2135
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,870
mean what is it the kinds of patterns
that the neural net likes to learn given

2136
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:20,880
that the neural net likes to learn given
 

2137
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,390
that the neural net likes to learn given
the way that it's built and the way

2138
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,400
the way that it's built and the way
 

2139
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,990
the way that it's built and the way
you're training it. That is called

2140
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,000
you're training it. That is called
 

2141
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,390
you're training it. That is called
inductive bias. So you want to shape the

2142
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,400
inductive bias. So you want to shape the
 

2143
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,230
inductive bias. So you want to shape the
inductive bias towards the patterns you

2144
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
inductive bias towards the patterns you
 

2145
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,829
inductive bias towards the patterns you
want. You do some of it with

2146
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:29,839
want. You do some of it with
 

2147
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,750
want. You do some of it with
architecture, some with optimizers and

2148
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:31,760
architecture, some with optimizers and
 

2149
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,910
architecture, some with optimizers and
some of it with augmentations.

2150
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:35,920

 

2151
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,550

Okay. So these are easy to understand

2152
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:38,560
Okay. So these are easy to understand
 

2153
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,190
Okay. So these are easy to understand
but I could stop here but you should

2154
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,200
but I could stop here but you should
 

2155
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,430
but I could stop here but you should
acknowledge reality which is reality is

2156
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:43,440
acknowledge reality which is reality is
 

2157
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,349
acknowledge reality which is reality is
more complicated than just this basic

2158
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:45,359
more complicated than just this basic
 

2159
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:49,270
more complicated than just this basic
story. And so you have more aggressive

2160
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:49,280
story. And so you have more aggressive
 

2161
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,069
story. And so you have more aggressive
augmentations that are applied that

2162
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:52,079
augmentations that are applied that
 

2163
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,349
augmentations that are applied that
people find practically give robustness.

2164
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:55,359
people find practically give robustness.
 

2165
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,589
people find practically give robustness.
So here are

2166
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:57,599
So here are
 

2167
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,190
So here are
uh some of these u more

2168
00:47:59,190 --> 00:47:59,200
uh some of these u more
 

2169
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,390
uh some of these u more
robustnessoriented augmentations. So

2170
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:02,400
robustnessoriented augmentations. So
 

2171
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,829
robustnessoriented augmentations. So
I'll just show them to you visually.

2172
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:03,839
I'll just show them to you visually.
 

2173
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,710
I'll just show them to you visually.
Here's the baseline a picture this bird.

2174
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,720
Here's the baseline a picture this bird.
 

2175
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,910
Here's the baseline a picture this bird.
So there's the cutout augmentation which

2176
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:09,920
So there's the cutout augmentation which
 

2177
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,670
So there's the cutout augmentation which
just takes a block of the image and just

2178
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:13,680
just takes a block of the image and just
 

2179
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,109
just takes a block of the image and just
cuts it out.

2180
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:17,119

 

2181
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,030

Did everyone see that? So this is

2182
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,040
Did everyone see that? So this is
 

2183
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,069
Did everyone see that? So this is
another augmentation uh that is uh find

2184
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:24,079
another augmentation uh that is uh find
 

2185
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,630
another augmentation uh that is uh find
found useful to make your learn

2186
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:26,640
found useful to make your learn
 

2187
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,910
found useful to make your learn
classifiers more robust.

2188
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:29,920
classifiers more robust.
 

2189
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,710
classifiers more robust.
There's mixup. So I don't know if people

2190
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:32,720
There's mixup. So I don't know if people
 

2191
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,549
There's mixup. So I don't know if people
can see there's a picture of a bird and

2192
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:34,559
can see there's a picture of a bird and
 

2193
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,030
can see there's a picture of a bird and
a picture of a sea turtle. They've been

2194
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,040
a picture of a sea turtle. They've been
 

2195
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,069
a picture of a sea turtle. They've been
alpha channel blended together and the

2196
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:40,079
alpha channel blended together and the
 

2197
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,589
alpha channel blended together and the
class for this is no longer so if you go

2198
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:43,599
class for this is no longer so if you go
 

2199
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,030
class for this is no longer so if you go
back to what you saw in your machine

2200
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:45,040
back to what you saw in your machine
 

2201
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,030
back to what you saw in your machine
learning class for training classifiers

2202
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:47,040
learning class for training classifiers
 

2203
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,430
learning class for training classifiers
you can think about the label as being a

2204
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
you can think about the label as being a
 

2205
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,910
you can think about the label as being a
one hot encoding that says it's this

2206
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:51,920
one hot encoding that says it's this
 

2207
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,349
one hot encoding that says it's this
class and not any of the other classes.

2208
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:53,359
class and not any of the other classes.
 

2209
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:54,150
class and not any of the other classes.
Everyone remember this from your

2210
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:54,160
Everyone remember this from your
 

2211
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,549
Everyone remember this from your
multiclass classification from your

2212
00:48:56,549 --> 00:48:56,559
multiclass classification from your
 

2213
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,030
multiclass classification from your
machine learning class. So when you do

2214
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,040
machine learning class. So when you do
 

2215
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,430
machine learning class. So when you do
mix up what you do is you say this thing

2216
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:01,440
mix up what you do is you say this thing
 

2217
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,390
mix up what you do is you say this thing
isn't just that bird it's a bird and

2218
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:04,400
isn't just that bird it's a bird and
 

2219
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,349
isn't just that bird it's a bird and
it's a sea turtle little bit little bit

2220
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:07,359
it's a sea turtle little bit little bit
 

2221
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,430
it's a sea turtle little bit little bit
sea turtle lot bit bird

2222
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:11,440
sea turtle lot bit bird
 

2223
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,910
sea turtle lot bit bird
okay so this is kind of alpha channel

2224
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:13,920
okay so this is kind of alpha channel
 

2225
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,030
okay so this is kind of alpha channel
blending then you have cut mix

2226
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:17,040
blending then you have cut mix
 

2227
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,549
blending then you have cut mix
which is like cutout plus mixup

2228
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:20,559
which is like cutout plus mixup
 

2229
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,430
which is like cutout plus mixup
in which you take a cutout and you put

2230
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:23,440
in which you take a cutout and you put
 

2231
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,630
in which you take a cutout and you put
the other image inside the cutout.

2232
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:26,640
the other image inside the cutout.
 

2233
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,150
the other image inside the cutout.
So this is a little bit of a sea turtle

2234
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:28,160
So this is a little bit of a sea turtle
 

2235
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,109
So this is a little bit of a sea turtle
and a bird but mixed together this way.

2236
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:33,119
and a bird but mixed together this way.
 

2237
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,069
and a bird but mixed together this way.
And then there's this pix which is the

2238
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:36,079
And then there's this pix which is the
 

2239
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,349
And then there's this pix which is the
one this paper is doing which I'll

2240
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:37,359
one this paper is doing which I'll
 

2241
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,190
one this paper is doing which I'll
explain more which is a much weirder

2242
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:39,200
explain more which is a much weirder
 

2243
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,349
explain more which is a much weirder
one. Um so the first thing that I want

2244
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:43,359
one. Um so the first thing that I want
 

2245
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,030
one. Um so the first thing that I want
to point out here again is a little bit

2246
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,040
to point out here again is a little bit
 

2247
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,190
to point out here again is a little bit
of deep learning philosophy and also

2248
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:47,200
of deep learning philosophy and also
 

2249
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,069
of deep learning philosophy and also
what's happening

2250
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:50,079
what's happening
 

2251
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,950
what's happening
all of these simple augmentations can be

2252
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:52,960
all of these simple augmentations can be
 

2253
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,870
all of these simple augmentations can be
thought of as trying to make sure that

2254
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:54,880
thought of as trying to make sure that
 

2255
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,549
thought of as trying to make sure that
your training data with the

2256
00:49:56,549 --> 00:49:56,559
your training data with the
 

2257
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,109
your training data with the
augmentations looks more like the

2258
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
augmentations looks more like the
 

2259
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,030
augmentations looks more like the
natural distribution that you expect to

2260
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:01,040
natural distribution that you expect to
 

2261
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,030
natural distribution that you expect to
see. You expect to see rotations in

2262
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:03,040
see. You expect to see rotations in
 

2263
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,790
see. You expect to see rotations in
nature. You happen to have this

2264
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:04,800
nature. You happen to have this
 

2265
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,950
nature. You happen to have this
particular picture. So to make yourself

2266
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:06,960
particular picture. So to make yourself
 

2267
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,710
particular picture. So to make yourself
cover the distribution better, you add

2268
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:08,720
cover the distribution better, you add
 

2269
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,790
cover the distribution better, you add
little local rotations. Everyone see

2270
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:10,800
little local rotations. Everyone see
 

2271
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,349
little local rotations. Everyone see
that? So this kind of stuff can be

2272
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:13,359
that? So this kind of stuff can be
 

2273
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,670
that? So this kind of stuff can be
understood with the philosophy of I want

2274
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:15,680
understood with the philosophy of I want
 

2275
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,589
understood with the philosophy of I want
to make my training distribution look

2276
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:17,599
to make my training distribution look
 

2277
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,150
to make my training distribution look
like my test distribution.

2278
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:20,160
like my test distribution.
 

2279
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,309
like my test distribution.
This is different.

2280
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:22,319
This is different.
 

2281
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,630
This is different.
Does everyone see that? You don't expect

2282
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:24,640
Does everyone see that? You don't expect
 

2283
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,630
Does everyone see that? You don't expect
to see this during testing.

2284
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:28,640
to see this during testing.
 

2285
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,150
to see this during testing.
You don't expect to see this during

2286
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:30,160
You don't expect to see this during
 

2287
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,750
You don't expect to see this during
testing.

2288
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760
testing.
 

2289
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,510
testing.
But these are more aggressive

2290
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:33,520
But these are more aggressive
 

2291
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,190
But these are more aggressive
augmentations that are done during

2292
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:35,200
augmentations that are done during
 

2293
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,349
augmentations that are done during
training that make your training

2294
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:37,359
training that make your training
 

2295
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,109
training that make your training
distribution in a sense sense harder

2296
00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:41,119
distribution in a sense sense harder
 

2297
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,109
distribution in a sense sense harder
than what you expect to see at testing

2298
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:43,119
than what you expect to see at testing
 

2299
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,309
than what you expect to see at testing
to get better performance at testing.

2300
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:46,319
to get better performance at testing.
 

2301
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,829
to get better performance at testing.
So this doesn't fit in the make the

2302
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:47,839
So this doesn't fit in the make the
 

2303
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,230
So this doesn't fit in the make the
distributions match

2304
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:50,240
distributions match
 

2305
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,750
distributions match
point of view.

2306
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:53,760

 

2307
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,190

Okay. So just as an example, I'll show

2308
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:57,200
Okay. So just as an example, I'll show
 

2309
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,030
Okay. So just as an example, I'll show
you this psychedelic um pixm mix uh

2310
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:01,040
you this psychedelic um pixm mix uh
 

2311
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,309
you this psychedelic um pixm mix uh
augmentation what that looks like.

2312
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:04,319
augmentation what that looks like.
 

2313
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,270
augmentation what that looks like.
So this particular just as an example of

2314
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:07,280
So this particular just as an example of
 

2315
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,309
So this particular just as an example of
how people creep people get creative.

2316
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:10,319
how people creep people get creative.
 

2317
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,950
how people creep people get creative.
Take an image they pick from a

2318
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:12,960
Take an image they pick from a
 

2319
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,190
Take an image they pick from a
particular set of what can only be

2320
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:15,200
particular set of what can only be
 

2321
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,990
particular set of what can only be
described as psychedelic images like

2322
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:18,000
described as psychedelic images like
 

2323
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,349
described as psychedelic images like
fractals and like weird curvy shapes and

2324
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:21,359
fractals and like weird curvy shapes and
 

2325
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,069
fractals and like weird curvy shapes and
stuff like that. They take one of those

2326
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:24,079
stuff like that. They take one of those
 

2327
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,710
stuff like that. They take one of those
and they add it in. Then they do an

2328
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:26,720
and they add it in. Then they do an
 

2329
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,069
and they add it in. Then they do an
augmentation of the original image and

2330
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
augmentation of the original image and
 

2331
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,470
augmentation of the original image and
multiply that in. And then they take

2332
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:32,480
multiply that in. And then they take
 

2333
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,390
multiply that in. And then they take
that same mixing image and they multiply

2334
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:34,400
that same mixing image and they multiply
 

2335
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,190
that same mixing image and they multiply
that in. And what you get is kind of a

2336
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:37,200
that in. And what you get is kind of a
 

2337
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,349
that in. And what you get is kind of a
somewhat dreamlike

2338
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:39,359
somewhat dreamlike
 

2339
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,790
somewhat dreamlike
weird image of,

2340
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:42,800
weird image of,
 

2341
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,190
weird image of,
you know, the original image with this

2342
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200
you know, the original image with this
 

2343
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,430
you know, the original image with this
kind of strange

2344
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:47,440
kind of strange
 

2345
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,109
kind of strange
hallucinatory

2346
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:49,119
hallucinatory
 

2347
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,230
hallucinatory
like backdrop mixed in.

2348
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:52,240
like backdrop mixed in.
 

2349
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,589
like backdrop mixed in.
And this was found to increase the

2350
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:53,599
And this was found to increase the
 

2351
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,270
And this was found to increase the
robustness of the resulting classifier.

2352
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:57,280
robustness of the resulting classifier.
 

2353
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,950
robustness of the resulting classifier.
Okay. So people do things like this.

2354
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:58,960
Okay. So people do things like this.
 

2355
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,589
Okay. So people do things like this.
Yeah.

2356
00:51:59,589 --> 00:51:59,599
Yeah.
 

2357
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,309
Yeah.
>> Is this so that like edge detectors

2358
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:02,319
>> Is this so that like edge detectors
 

2359
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,950
>> Is this so that like edge detectors
aren't as good of an indicator of what

2360
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:04,960
aren't as good of an indicator of what
 

2361
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,109
aren't as good of an indicator of what
the image is. So is it like reducing the

2362
00:52:07,109 --> 00:52:07,119
the image is. So is it like reducing the
 

2363
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,630
the image is. So is it like reducing the
impact of the individual edge detectors

2364
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,640
impact of the individual edge detectors
 

2365
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,589
impact of the individual edge detectors
on the final result?

2366
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:09,599
on the final result?
 

2367
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,270
on the final result?
>> Yeah, it's a great great question. So I

2368
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:11,280
>> Yeah, it's a great great question. So I
 

2369
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,430

I'll repeat it. The intuition behind

2370
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:13,440
I'll repeat it. The intuition behind
 

2371
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,470
I'll repeat it. The intuition behind
this is indeed that you want to make it

2372
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:16,480
this is indeed that you want to make it
 

2373
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,390
this is indeed that you want to make it
so that you really have to look at the

2374
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
so that you really have to look at the
 

2375
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,390
so that you really have to look at the
picture as a whole and not get caught by

2376
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:22,400
picture as a whole and not get caught by
 

2377
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,230
picture as a whole and not get caught by
little edge detectors and things like

2378
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,240
little edge detectors and things like
 

2379
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,109
little edge detectors and things like
this. So the fact that these are

2380
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:25,119
this. So the fact that these are
 

2381
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,109
this. So the fact that these are
hallucin what makes people think of

2382
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:27,119
hallucin what makes people think of
 

2383
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,549
hallucin what makes people think of
these as psychedelic images that they're

2384
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:28,559
these as psychedelic images that they're
 

2385
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,190
these as psychedelic images that they're
pleasing to the eye. You know your eye

2386
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,200
pleasing to the eye. You know your eye
 

2387
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,589
pleasing to the eye. You know your eye
is drawn to them. And so the idea is

2388
00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:33,599
is drawn to them. And so the idea is
 

2389
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,390
is drawn to them. And so the idea is
that you want to add these distractors

2390
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:36,400
that you want to add these distractors
 

2391
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,349
that you want to add these distractors
into the image and these distractors are

2392
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
into the image and these distractors are
 

2393
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,630
into the image and these distractors are
used uh to help with the training. So

2394
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:42,640
used uh to help with the training. So
 

2395
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,510
used uh to help with the training. So
this philosophy of training in a way

2396
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:45,520
this philosophy of training in a way
 

2397
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,069
this philosophy of training in a way
that is not necessarily what you're

2398
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:48,079
that is not necessarily what you're
 

2399
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,589
that is not necessarily what you're
going to see at test time to increase

2400
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:49,599
going to see at test time to increase
 

2401
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,630
going to see at test time to increase
the robustness is something which occurs

2402
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:52,640
the robustness is something which occurs
 

2403
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,390
the robustness is something which occurs
definitely in images but also in other

2404
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:54,400
definitely in images but also in other
 

2405
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,630
definitely in images but also in other
domains. You might have heard the recent

2406
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:56,640
domains. You might have heard the recent
 

2407
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,549
domains. You might have heard the recent
um anthropic uh you might have heard

2408
00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:58,559
um anthropic uh you might have heard
 

2409
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,030
um anthropic uh you might have heard
this anthropic was doing this. they

2410
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:01,040
this anthropic was doing this. they
 

2411
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,510
this anthropic was doing this. they
talked about in a a public post where

2412
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,520
talked about in a a public post where
 

2413
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,829
talked about in a a public post where
they would take

2414
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:05,839
they would take
 

2415
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,430
they would take
their

2416
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:07,440
their
 

2417
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,390
their
large language model and they'd like

2418
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:10,400
large language model and they'd like
 

2419
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,630
large language model and they'd like
tune up some directions associated with

2420
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:12,640
tune up some directions associated with
 

2421
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,470
tune up some directions associated with
being bad um during its training

2422
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:16,480
being bad um during its training
 

2423
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,030
being bad um during its training
to sort of try to tempt it into being

2424
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:19,040
to sort of try to tempt it into being
 

2425
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,069
to sort of try to tempt it into being
bad but then force it to be good with

2426
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:22,079
bad but then force it to be good with
 

2427
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,910
bad but then force it to be good with
the idea that this is meant to help

2428
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:23,920
the idea that this is meant to help
 

2429
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,030
the idea that this is meant to help
defend against uh it breaking its

2430
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,040
defend against uh it breaking its
 

2431
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,910
defend against uh it breaking its
behavior in real life uh when people

2432
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:29,920
behavior in real life uh when people
 

2433
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,910
behavior in real life uh when people
might you know engaging be engaging with

2434
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:31,920
might you know engaging be engaging with
 

2435
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,470
might you know engaging be engaging with
it. So this you can think of as in the

2436
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:34,480
it. So this you can think of as in the
 

2437
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,390
it. So this you can think of as in the
spirit of augmentations.

2438
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
spirit of augmentations.
 

2439
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,549
spirit of augmentations.
Okay. So this is like a larger spirit

2440
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:38,559
Okay. So this is like a larger spirit
 

2441
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,230
Okay. So this is like a larger spirit
that goes beyond the specifics of the

2442
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:40,240
that goes beyond the specifics of the
 

2443
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,270
that goes beyond the specifics of the
details here.

2444
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:43,280
details here.
 

2445
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,549
details here.
Okay. Any questions on augmentation?

2446
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
Okay. Any questions on augmentation?
 

2447
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:47,750
Okay. Any questions on augmentation?
I don't want to spend too long on it. I

2448
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:47,760
I don't want to spend too long on it. I
 

2449
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,549
I don't want to spend too long on it. I
just want to make sure everyone

2450
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
just want to make sure everyone
 

2451
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,630
just want to make sure everyone
understands the idea.

2452
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:50,640
understands the idea.
 

2453
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,589
understands the idea.
>> Yeah.

2454
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:55,599

 

2455
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,549

are someies of this kind of practical

2456
00:53:58,549 --> 00:53:58,559
are someies of this kind of practical
 

2457
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,549
are someies of this kind of practical
stream.

2458
00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:02,559

 

2459
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,230

>> Yeah. So they they in the paper which I

2460
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:04,240
>> Yeah. So they they in the paper which I
 

2461
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,430
>> Yeah. So they they in the paper which I
encourage you to look at it's well

2462
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
encourage you to look at it's well
 

2463
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,870
encourage you to look at it's well
written um they talk about how this

2464
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:08,880
written um they talk about how this
 

2465
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,270
written um they talk about how this
particular augmentation gains in

2466
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:11,280
particular augmentation gains in
 

2467
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,069
particular augmentation gains in
robustness against people trying to

2468
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079
robustness against people trying to
 

2469
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,910
robustness against people trying to
especially adversarial attacks a little

2470
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:15,920
especially adversarial attacks a little
 

2471
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,510
especially adversarial attacks a little
few adversarial attacks but also just

2472
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:17,520
few adversarial attacks but also just
 

2473
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,990
few adversarial attacks but also just
generalization generally.

2474
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,000
generalization generally.
 

2475
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,630
generalization generally.
Um yeah, especially generalization when

2476
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:22,640
Um yeah, especially generalization when
 

2477
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,510
Um yeah, especially generalization when
the distributions shift more. So when

2478
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:25,520
the distributions shift more. So when
 

2479
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,630
the distributions shift more. So when
people talk about robustness, that's

2480
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:26,640
people talk about robustness, that's
 

2481
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,470
people talk about robustness, that's
usually what they mean that you are

2482
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:28,480
usually what they mean that you are
 

2483
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,069
usually what they mean that you are
looking at either people trying to

2484
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:30,079
looking at either people trying to
 

2485
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,670
looking at either people trying to
attack the model, which we'll talk about

2486
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:31,680
attack the model, which we'll talk about
 

2487
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,549
attack the model, which we'll talk about
later, but uh just working in more

2488
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:34,559
later, but uh just working in more
 

2489
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,710
later, but uh just working in more
general settings to learn the right

2490
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:36,720
general settings to learn the right
 

2491
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,430
general settings to learn the right
patterns and not overfit to a particular

2492
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:39,440
patterns and not overfit to a particular
 

2493
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,470
patterns and not overfit to a particular
domain.

2494
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:44,480

 

2495
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,390

Okay.

2496
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:46,400
Okay.
 

2497
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,230
Okay.
So now I want to uh come back to

2498
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:50,240
So now I want to uh come back to
 

2499
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,910
So now I want to uh come back to
training.

2500
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:51,920
training.
 

2501
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,150
training.
So remember at the beginning of this uh

2502
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:54,160
So remember at the beginning of this uh
 

2503
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,950
So remember at the beginning of this uh
module I started talking about you know

2504
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:56,960
module I started talking about you know
 

2505
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,710
module I started talking about you know
there's what you need for expressiveness

2506
00:54:58,710 --> 00:54:58,720
there's what you need for expressiveness
 

2507
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,309
there's what you need for expressiveness
and there's what you need for training

2508
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:00,319
and there's what you need for training
 

2509
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,390
and there's what you need for training
and these are different. So I want to

2510
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
and these are different. So I want to
 

2511
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,910
and these are different. So I want to
shift into the training side now.

2512
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:05,920
shift into the training side now.
 

2513
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,710
shift into the training side now.
So for training what you want is it

2514
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
So for training what you want is it
 

2515
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,910
So for training what you want is it
should be effective which means you

2516
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:09,920
should be effective which means you
 

2517
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,270
should be effective which means you
should learn something that generalizes

2518
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,280
should learn something that generalizes
 

2519
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,510
should learn something that generalizes
well and one of the prerequisite the

2520
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:13,520
well and one of the prerequisite the
 

2521
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,190
well and one of the prerequisite the
most basic prerequisite for

2522
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,200
most basic prerequisite for
 

2523
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,910
most basic prerequisite for
effectiveness is stability. The training

2524
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:17,920
effectiveness is stability. The training
 

2525
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,910
effectiveness is stability. The training
has to actually work. So what do we mean

2526
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:19,920
has to actually work. So what do we mean
 

2527
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,549
has to actually work. So what do we mean
by instability in training? The most

2528
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:22,559
by instability in training? The most
 

2529
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,549
by instability in training? The most
dramatic kind of instability in training

2530
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:24,559
dramatic kind of instability in training
 

2531
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:25,910
dramatic kind of instability in training
is you sit there, you start running the

2532
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:25,920
is you sit there, you start running the
 

2533
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,910
is you sit there, you start running the
training loop and then you look later,

2534
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:27,920
training loop and then you look later,
 

2535
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,750
training loop and then you look later,
it's not training at all. And you look

2536
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:29,760
it's not training at all. And you look
 

2537
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,589
it's not training at all. And you look
at what's going on and you see nan

2538
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:33,599
at what's going on and you see nan
 

2539
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,069
at what's going on and you see nan
nan, right? You're like, okay, something

2540
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:36,079
nan, right? You're like, okay, something
 

2541
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,790
nan, right? You're like, okay, something
bad happened. This is, you know, bad

2542
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:38,800
bad happened. This is, you know, bad
 

2543
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,390
bad happened. This is, you know, bad
things have happened. This is training

2544
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:40,400
things have happened. This is training
 

2545
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,549
things have happened. This is training
instability. Usually what happens is

2546
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:42,559
instability. Usually what happens is
 

2547
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,470
instability. Usually what happens is
some gradients become too large. They

2548
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:44,480
some gradients become too large. They
 

2549
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,349
some gradients become too large. They
then overflow. You get nans.

2550
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:47,359
then overflow. You get nans.
 

2551
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:49,030
then overflow. You get nans.
So

2552
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:49,040
So
 

2553
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,270
So
how do you make this not happen? Okay,

2554
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:51,280
how do you make this not happen? Okay,
 

2555
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,990
how do you make this not happen? Okay,
this is the the topic that we're moving

2556
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:54,000
this is the the topic that we're moving
 

2557
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,390
this is the the topic that we're moving
to now.

2558
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:56,400
to now.
 

2559
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,510
to now.
Okay, so

2560
00:55:59,510 --> 00:55:59,520
Okay, so
 

2561
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,069
Okay, so
if you look at these pictures here of

2562
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:02,079
if you look at these pictures here of
 

2563
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,630
if you look at these pictures here of
these networks,

2564
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:04,640
these networks,
 

2565
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,390
these networks,
they're very straightforward. Everything

2566
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:06,400
they're very straightforward. Everything
 

2567
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,109
they're very straightforward. Everything
is here is expressive.

2568
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:09,119
is here is expressive.
 

2569
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,470
is here is expressive.
But what people found is that, and I'm

2570
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:12,480
But what people found is that, and I'm
 

2571
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,750
But what people found is that, and I'm
lying a little, even when they were

2572
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:13,760
lying a little, even when they were
 

2573
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,150
lying a little, even when they were
training these, there were other

2574
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:16,160
training these, there were other
 

2575
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,230
training these, there were other
normalizations they were doing to make

2576
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:18,240
normalizations they were doing to make
 

2577
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,470
normalizations they were doing to make
even these train. um I think they're

2578
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:20,480
even these train. um I think they're
 

2579
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,230
even these train. um I think they're
called like local response normalization

2580
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,240
called like local response normalization
 

2581
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,349
called like local response normalization
and things like that. We're not even

2582
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:23,359
and things like that. We're not even
 

2583
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:24,710
and things like that. We're not even
going to talk about them because they're

2584
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:24,720
going to talk about them because they're
 

2585
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,069
going to talk about them because they're
they're outdated. U

2586
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
they're outdated. U
 

2587
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,710
they're outdated. U
but the big problem is you have many

2588
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:32,720
but the big problem is you have many
 

2589
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,950
but the big problem is you have many
things stacked on top of each other and

2590
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:34,960
things stacked on top of each other and
 

2591
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,069
things stacked on top of each other and
kind of a deep network. And so the

2592
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:38,079
kind of a deep network. And so the
 

2593
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,549
kind of a deep network. And so the
problem is we already told you that

2594
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
problem is we already told you that
 

2595
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,190
problem is we already told you that
there is this issue with conf is that

2596
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,200
there is this issue with conf is that
 

2597
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,390
there is this issue with conf is that
the gradients can get big.

2598
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,400
the gradients can get big.
 

2599
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,589
the gradients can get big.
Okay. And so just because you're adding

2600
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:49,599
Okay. And so just because you're adding
 

2601
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,430
Okay. And so just because you're adding
a bunch of numbers up together, but now

2602
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:51,440
a bunch of numbers up together, but now
 

2603
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,030
a bunch of numbers up together, but now
you think about what happens as you go

2604
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:53,040
you think about what happens as you go
 

2605
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,069
you think about what happens as you go
back through a network.

2606
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:56,079
back through a network.
 

2607
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,990
back through a network.
One time things getting a little big is

2608
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,000
One time things getting a little big is
 

2609
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,470
One time things getting a little big is
one thing. But if it happens over and

2610
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:00,480
one thing. But if it happens over and
 

2611
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,549
one thing. But if it happens over and
over again and it happens in a way that

2612
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:02,559
over again and it happens in a way that
 

2613
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:07,430
over again and it happens in a way that
is uh blowing up that can be bad. So

2614
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:07,440
is uh blowing up that can be bad. So
 

2615
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,750
is uh blowing up that can be bad. So
even with FB32

2616
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:09,760
even with FB32
 

2617
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,349
even with FB32
you can tolerate arithmetic growth

2618
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:13,359
you can tolerate arithmetic growth
 

2619
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:16,150
you can tolerate arithmetic growth
but you can't tolerate geometric growth

2620
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:16,160
but you can't tolerate geometric growth
 

2621
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,789
but you can't tolerate geometric growth
because geometric growth you know making

2622
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:18,799
because geometric growth you know making
 

2623
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,150
because geometric growth you know making
something doubling every time you can

2624
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:20,160
something doubling every time you can
 

2625
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,589
something doubling every time you can
think of as consuming one bit of

2626
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:23,599
think of as consuming one bit of
 

2627
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,069
think of as consuming one bit of
exponent every single time you'll run

2628
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:26,079
exponent every single time you'll run
 

2629
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,030
exponent every single time you'll run
out. Did everyone see that? So you're

2630
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:29,040
out. Did everyone see that? So you're
 

2631
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,230
out. Did everyone see that? So you're
really worried about when things

2632
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
really worried about when things
 

2633
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,309
really worried about when things
multiply together of bad things

2634
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:32,319
multiply together of bad things
 

2635
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:36,630
multiply together of bad things
happening.

2636
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:36,640

 

2637
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:44,069

So

2638
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:44,079

 

2639
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,750

this is the problem that is solved by

2640
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:47,760
this is the problem that is solved by
 

2641
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,710
this is the problem that is solved by
normalization layers.

2642
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:50,720
normalization layers.
 

2643
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,270
normalization layers.
Okay. So

2644
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:53,280
Okay. So
 

2645
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,510
Okay. So
one way intuitively to think about what

2646
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:55,520
one way intuitively to think about what
 

2647
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,349
one way intuitively to think about what
a normalization layer is doing from the

2648
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:57,359
a normalization layer is doing from the
 

2649
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:02,150
a normalization layer is doing from the
perspective of training is you want to

2650
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:02,160
perspective of training is you want to
 

2651
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,789
perspective of training is you want to
think of it as saying I want to insert

2652
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:06,799
think of it as saying I want to insert
 

2653
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,670
think of it as saying I want to insert
use this here. I want to insert in

2654
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:09,680
use this here. I want to insert in
 

2655
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,670
use this here. I want to insert in
between things

2656
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:11,680
between things
 

2657
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,750
between things
between layers of my network

2658
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:15,760
between layers of my network
 

2659
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,390
between layers of my network
additional layers whose function is to

2660
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:18,400
additional layers whose function is to
 

2661
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,109
additional layers whose function is to
act as speed bumps for the gradients

2662
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,119
act as speed bumps for the gradients
 

2663
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,549
act as speed bumps for the gradients
going backward so they don't blow up and

2664
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:24,559
going backward so they don't blow up and
 

2665
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,270
going backward so they don't blow up and
also by the same token

2666
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,280
also by the same token
 

2667
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,270
also by the same token
speed bumps for the activations going

2668
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:29,280
speed bumps for the activations going
 

2669
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,670
speed bumps for the activations going
forward so those don't blow up. Does

2670
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:31,680
forward so those don't blow up. Does
 

2671
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,190
forward so those don't blow up. Does
everyone see this? This is like the

2672
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,200
everyone see this? This is like the
 

2673
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,150
everyone see this? This is like the
idea. It's like just a high level

2674
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:36,160
idea. It's like just a high level
 

2675
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,589
idea. It's like just a high level
picture of what the normalization layers

2676
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:37,599
picture of what the normalization layers
 

2677
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,470
picture of what the normalization layers
are trying to do.

2678
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:40,480
are trying to do.
 

2679
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,270
are trying to do.
So now the question becomes you know how

2680
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:43,280
So now the question becomes you know how
 

2681
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,230
So now the question becomes you know how
do you do it? So here I want to call out

2682
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:46,240
do you do it? So here I want to call out
 

2683
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,470
do you do it? So here I want to call out
something that you've seen before input

2684
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:48,480
something that you've seen before input
 

2685
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,230
something that you've seen before input
standardization. So you see in your

2686
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:50,240
standardization. So you see in your
 

2687
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,430
standardization. So you see in your
machine learning class has already been

2688
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:51,440
machine learning class has already been
 

2689
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,710
machine learning class has already been
talked about that you have sometimes you

2690
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:54,720
talked about that you have sometimes you
 

2691
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,630
talked about that you have sometimes you
have inputs and you would like to

2692
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:56,640
have inputs and you would like to
 

2693
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,950
have inputs and you would like to
standardize them. So you would like to

2694
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:58,960
standardize them. So you would like to
 

2695
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,510
standardize them. So you would like to
say whatever your inputs were natively

2696
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:01,520
say whatever your inputs were natively
 

2697
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,910
say whatever your inputs were natively
whatever their native units were convert

2698
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:03,920
whatever their native units were convert
 

2699
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,630
whatever their native units were convert
them in such a way that they either live

2700
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:06,640
them in such a way that they either live
 

2701
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,190
them in such a way that they either live
within a finite

2702
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:09,200
within a finite
 

2703
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,710
within a finite
box

2704
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:10,720
box
 

2705
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,230
box
minus one one or alternatively they have

2706
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:14,240
minus one one or alternatively they have
 

2707
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,190
minus one one or alternatively they have
mean zero and variance one of these two

2708
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:17,200
mean zero and variance one of these two
 

2709
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,950
mean zero and variance one of these two
things. Okay this is input

2710
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:18,960
things. Okay this is input
 

2711
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,670
things. Okay this is input
standardization.

2712
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:21,680
standardization.
 

2713
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,549
standardization.
So another perspective of thinking about

2714
00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:24,559
So another perspective of thinking about
 

2715
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,109
So another perspective of thinking about
what normalization layers are doing is

2716
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:27,119
what normalization layers are doing is
 

2717
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,390
what normalization layers are doing is
the following. It says look

2718
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:30,400
the following. It says look
 

2719
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,990
the following. It says look
you can take your inputs whatever they

2720
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:32,000
you can take your inputs whatever they
 

2721
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,630
you can take your inputs whatever they
are and you can standardize them. Okay

2722
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:34,640
are and you can standardize them. Okay
 

2723
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,030
are and you can standardize them. Okay
that's now done. So now you have a a

2724
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,040
that's now done. So now you have a a
 

2725
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,270
that's now done. So now you have a a
standardized set of inputs that come in.

2726
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:39,280
standardized set of inputs that come in.
 

2727
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,230
standardized set of inputs that come in.
But remember in your network the output

2728
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:42,240
But remember in your network the output
 

2729
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,589
But remember in your network the output
of this layer is the input to this

2730
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:45,599
of this layer is the input to this
 

2731
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,510
of this layer is the input to this
layer.

2732
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
layer.
 

2733
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,510
layer.
And so input standardization was a good

2734
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:49,520
And so input standardization was a good
 

2735
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,510
And so input standardization was a good
idea at the beginning.

2736
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:51,520
idea at the beginning.
 

2737
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:57,190
idea at the beginning.
Maybe it's also a good idea here.

2738
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:57,200

 

2739
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,789

So does everyone see that at a high

2740
00:59:58,789 --> 00:59:58,799
So does everyone see that at a high
 

2741
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,950
So does everyone see that at a high
level as a how you would approach it?

2742
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:00,960
level as a how you would approach it?
 

2743
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,950
level as a how you would approach it?
Practical problem you're trying to solve

2744
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:02,960
Practical problem you're trying to solve
 

2745
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,670
Practical problem you're trying to solve
is you would like to have your network

2746
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:05,680
is you would like to have your network
 

2747
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,109
is you would like to have your network
not result in nans and to make sure that

2748
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:09,119
not result in nans and to make sure that
 

2749
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,150
not result in nans and to make sure that
it can train effectively. That's your

2750
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:12,160
it can train effectively. That's your
 

2751
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,309
it can train effectively. That's your
practical problem. Now your question is

2752
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:14,319
practical problem. Now your question is
 

2753
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,150
practical problem. Now your question is
what do you do? You think, okay,

2754
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,160
what do you do? You think, okay,
 

2755
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,630
what do you do? You think, okay,
maybe I can do some kind of thing

2756
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:20,640
maybe I can do some kind of thing
 

2757
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,870
maybe I can do some kind of thing
counterpart to input standardization to

2758
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:22,880
counterpart to input standardization to
 

2759
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,150
counterpart to input standardization to
sort of make sure that everything gets

2760
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:24,160
sort of make sure that everything gets
 

2761
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,750
sort of make sure that everything gets
recentered and brought into a right in

2762
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:25,760
recentered and brought into a right in
 

2763
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,750
recentered and brought into a right in
the right place

2764
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:27,760
the right place
 

2765
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,510
the right place
at least recentered rescaled things like

2766
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:29,520
at least recentered rescaled things like
 

2767
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,270
at least recentered rescaled things like
this.

2768
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,280

 

2769
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,589

Okay. So

2770
01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:35,599
Okay. So
 

2771
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,270
Okay. So
now

2772
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:37,280
now
 

2773
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,630
now
uh fortunately from the perspective of

2774
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:40,640
uh fortunately from the perspective of
 

2775
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,789
uh fortunately from the perspective of
things that you've um already seen in

2776
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:42,799
things that you've um already seen in
 

2777
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:47,030
things that you've um already seen in
this class we already have one idea that

2778
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:47,040
this class we already have one idea that
 

2779
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,510
this class we already have one idea that
we can suggest

2780
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:49,520
we can suggest
 

2781
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:54,950
we can suggest
right so

2782
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:54,960

 

2783
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,829

okay so just keep this in the background

2784
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:57,839
okay so just keep this in the background
 

2785
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:01,670
okay so just keep this in the background
one idea is we saw in the discussions of

2786
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:01,680
one idea is we saw in the discussions of
 

2787
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,230
one idea is we saw in the discussions of
uh maximal update parameterization

2788
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:04,240
uh maximal update parameterization
 

2789
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,870
uh maximal update parameterization
that we made these assumptions about RMS

2790
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:06,880
that we made these assumptions about RMS
 

2791
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,990
that we made these assumptions about RMS
norms. Remember everyone, we said that

2792
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:10,000
norms. Remember everyone, we said that
 

2793
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,870
norms. Remember everyone, we said that
we're talking about maximum update

2794
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:10,880
we're talking about maximum update
 

2795
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,069
we're talking about maximum update
parameterizations. We're making

2796
01:01:12,069 --> 01:01:12,079
parameterizations. We're making
 

2797
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:14,549
parameterizations. We're making
assumptions. We said the input has RMS

2798
01:01:14,549 --> 01:01:14,559
assumptions. We said the input has RMS
 

2799
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:19,190
assumptions. We said the input has RMS
norm one on average. And so we want the

2800
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:19,200
norm one on average. And so we want the
 

2801
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,230
norm one on average. And so we want the
update to the matrix to be such that the

2802
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:22,240
update to the matrix to be such that the
 

2803
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,789
update to the matrix to be such that the
induced norm is correct in RMS to RMS

2804
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:24,799
induced norm is correct in RMS to RMS
 

2805
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:27,270
induced norm is correct in RMS to RMS
norm. Remember that. And then we argued

2806
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:27,280
norm. Remember that. And then we argued
 

2807
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,270
norm. Remember that. And then we argued
that initialization if we did the Xavier

2808
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,280
that initialization if we did the Xavier
 

2809
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,950
that initialization if we did the Xavier
or HU initialization depending on the

2810
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:30,960
or HU initialization depending on the
 

2811
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,589
or HU initialization depending on the
situation that initialization the RMS

2812
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:33,599
situation that initialization the RMS
 

2813
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,910
situation that initialization the RMS
norms would be good and then we said the

2814
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:35,920
norms would be good and then we said the
 

2815
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,589
norms would be good and then we said the
updates would be at the right scale but

2816
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:39,599
updates would be at the right scale but
 

2817
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,349
updates would be at the right scale but
we couldn't make a guarantee at what

2818
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:41,359
we couldn't make a guarantee at what
 

2819
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,190
we couldn't make a guarantee at what
happens after you do update after update

2820
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:43,200
happens after you do update after update
 

2821
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,109
happens after you do update after update
after update after update. So you start

2822
01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:45,119
after update after update. So you start
 

2823
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,270
after update after update. So you start
out okay you do some updates and now

2824
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:47,280
out okay you do some updates and now
 

2825
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,750
out okay you do some updates and now
after the first set of updates the RMS

2826
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:49,760
after the first set of updates the RMS
 

2827
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,910
after the first set of updates the RMS
norm somewhere might start getting big.

2828
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:51,920
norm somewhere might start getting big.
 

2829
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,510
norm somewhere might start getting big.
Everyone see this as a challenge and

2830
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:53,520
Everyone see this as a challenge and
 

2831
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,670
Everyone see this as a challenge and
just because you're allowed to move it

2832
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:55,680
just because you're allowed to move it
 

2833
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,710
just because you're allowed to move it
right a little bit and keeps moving now

2834
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:58,720
right a little bit and keeps moving now
 

2835
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,030
right a little bit and keeps moving now
it's big.

2836
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:01,040
it's big.
 

2837
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,789
it's big.
So

2838
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:02,799
So
 

2839
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:06,870
So
one idea is to simply force the RMS norm

2840
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:06,880
one idea is to simply force the RMS norm
 

2841
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,349
one idea is to simply force the RMS norm
to be one.

2842
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,359
to be one.
 

2843
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:10,789
to be one.
Does everyone see that as a kind of

2844
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:10,799
Does everyone see that as a kind of
 

2845
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:13,030
Does everyone see that as a kind of
idea? It's like I would like I made all

2846
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:13,040
idea? It's like I would like I made all
 

2847
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,870
idea? It's like I would like I made all
my training assumptions assuming the RMS

2848
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:14,880
my training assumptions assuming the RMS
 

2849
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,109
my training assumptions assuming the RMS
norm would be around one but I couldn't

2850
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:17,119
norm would be around one but I couldn't
 

2851
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:19,349
norm would be around one but I couldn't
guarantee it except that initialization.

2852
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:19,359
guarantee it except that initialization.
 

2853
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:32,710
guarantee it except that initialization.
So I'll force it.

2854
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:32,720

 

2855
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,950

So what would an RMS norm layer look

2856
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
So what would an RMS norm layer look
 

2857
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,230
So what would an RMS norm layer look
like? Does everyone understand what

2858
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
like? Does everyone understand what
 

2859
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,589
like? Does everyone understand what
we're trying to do? I would like to say

2860
01:02:37,589 --> 01:02:37,599
we're trying to do? I would like to say
 

2861
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,270
we're trying to do? I would like to say
that I have a network.

2862
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:41,280

 

2863
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,309

I have some hidden activations. H L

2864
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:46,319
I have some hidden activations. H L
 

2865
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:55,030
I have some hidden activations. H L
I would like to add something here.

2866
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:55,040

 

2867
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:59,589

an RMS normalizing layer such that

2868
01:02:59,589 --> 01:02:59,599
an RMS normalizing layer such that
 

2869
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:04,870
an RMS normalizing layer such that
what comes out let's call it H

Yeah.

2880
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
Yeah.
 

2881
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,950
Yeah.
>> Yeah. I thought you were talking about

>> Yeah. I thought you were talking about
 

2883
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,630

initialization is right that the updates

2886
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:27,440
initialization is right that the updates
 

2887
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,870
initialization is right that the updates
and stuff will stay order. So

2888
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:30,880
and stuff will stay order. So
 

2889
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,950
and stuff will stay order. So
>> excellent question. So the question was

2890
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:32,960
>> excellent question. So the question was
 

2891
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,190
>> excellent question. So the question was
we in Mup we argued that our updates

2892
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:35,200
we in Mup we argued that our updates
 

2893
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,190
we in Mup we argued that our updates
would be order one in the context of uh

2894
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
would be order one in the context of uh
 

2895
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,990
would be order one in the context of uh
the MUP initialization. By order one we

2896
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:42,000
the MUP initialization. By order one we
 

2897
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,069
the MUP initialization. By order one we
meant that if we may change the scale in

2898
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:44,079
meant that if we may change the scale in
 

2899
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:45,670
meant that if we may change the scale in
the sense we change this right we change

2900
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:45,680
the sense we change this right we change
 

2901
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,430
the sense we change this right we change
the appropriate thing we're scaling here

2902
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:47,440
the appropriate thing we're scaling here
 

2903
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,950
the appropriate thing we're scaling here
is dimension we made the dimensions much

2904
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:48,960
is dimension we made the dimensions much
 

2905
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,470
is dimension we made the dimensions much
larger it would continue to be order one

2906
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:52,480
larger it would continue to be order one
 

2907
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,150
larger it would continue to be order one
not changing with the dimensions we're

2908
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:54,160
not changing with the dimensions we're
 

2909
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,270
not changing with the dimensions we're
compensating for the effect of the

2910
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:55,280
compensating for the effect of the
 

2911
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,230
compensating for the effect of the
dimensions so order one you saw in the

2912
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:58,240
dimensions so order one you saw in the
 

2913
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,390
dimensions so order one you saw in the
homework is like tied to a learning rate

2914
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,400
homework is like tied to a learning rate
 

2915
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,029
homework is like tied to a learning rate
say 01

2916
01:04:03,029 --> 01:04:03,039
say 01
 

2917
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,910
say 01
is the scale of the update what is 01

2918
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:07,920
is the scale of the update what is 01
 

2919
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,750
is the scale of the update what is 01
0001 is one in a thousand

2920
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:11,760
0001 is one in a thousand
 

2921
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,390
0001 is one in a thousand
Okay. How many iterations are we going

2922
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:14,400
Okay. How many iterations are we going
 

2923
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,470
Okay. How many iterations are we going
to run?

2924
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:18,480

 

2925
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,109

So if you're allowed to move things by

2926
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:21,119
So if you're allowed to move things by
 

2927
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,990
So if you're allowed to move things by
1,000th, but you do it a million times,

2928
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:26,000
1,000th, but you do it a million times,
 

2929
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,829
1,000th, but you do it a million times,
you could find yourself out much bigger.

2930
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:29,839
you could find yourself out much bigger.
 

2931
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:31,430
you could find yourself out much bigger.
But the problem hits you much before

2932
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:31,440
But the problem hits you much before
 

2933
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,150
But the problem hits you much before
that, right? So as soon as you're out to

2934
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:34,160
that, right? So as soon as you're out to
 

2935
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,390
that, right? So as soon as you're out to
you started off at order one, and now

2936
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:36,400
you started off at order one, and now
 

2937
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,829
you started off at order one, and now
you've moved little by little by little

2938
01:04:37,829 --> 01:04:37,839
you've moved little by little by little
 

2939
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:41,029
you've moved little by little by little
during training. Okay? And now my RMS

2940
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:41,039
during training. Okay? And now my RMS
 

2941
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,630
during training. Okay? And now my RMS
norm is typically seven.

2942
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:44,640
norm is typically seven.
 

2943
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,750
norm is typically seven.
Okay, it's gotten bigger.

2944
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:47,760
Okay, it's gotten bigger.
 

2945
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,710
Okay, it's gotten bigger.
I'm like in potential trouble because my

2946
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
I'm like in potential trouble because my
 

2947
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,630
I'm like in potential trouble because my
assumption for the MUP update was I'm

2948
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:52,640
assumption for the MUP update was I'm
 

2949
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,470
assumption for the MUP update was I'm
making the weight matrix update so that

2950
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
making the weight matrix update so that
 

2951
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,950
making the weight matrix update so that
scale the next thing is order one if the

2952
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:58,960
scale the next thing is order one if the
 

2953
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,309
scale the next thing is order one if the
input was order one in RMS norm. Does

2954
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
input was order one in RMS norm. Does
 

2955
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:05,430
input was order one in RMS norm. Does
everyone see that? But now it's seven.

2956
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:05,440
everyone see that? But now it's seven.
 

2957
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,270
everyone see that? But now it's seven.
So this st size of update is actually

2958
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:07,280
So this st size of update is actually
 

2959
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,270
So this st size of update is actually
moving the up the next thing up by more.

2960
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:11,280
moving the up the next thing up by more.
 

2961
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,950
moving the up the next thing up by more.
So this can be bad. Does everyone see

2962
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:12,960
So this can be bad. Does everyone see
 

2963
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:13,589
So this can be bad. Does everyone see
that?

2964
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:13,599
that?
 

2965
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,430
that?
>> I thought we said that our updates are

2966
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:15,440
>> I thought we said that our updates are
 

2967
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,990
>> I thought we said that our updates are
also ordering order to order one.

2968
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,000
also ordering order to order one.
 

2969
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,230
also ordering order to order one.
>> So the problem is order one to order one

2970
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:22,240
>> So the problem is order one to order one
 

2971
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,990
>> So the problem is order one to order one
is order one. Not the order is not how

2972
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,000
is order one. Not the order is not how
 

2973
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,750
is order one. Not the order is not how
many times we're doing this. So there's

2974
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:27,760
many times we're doing this. So there's
 

2975
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,470
many times we're doing this. So there's
different things we're scaling.

2976
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:30,480
different things we're scaling.
 

2977
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,470
different things we're scaling.
We made sure the order was controlled

2978
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:32,480
We made sure the order was controlled
 

2979
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,750
We made sure the order was controlled
with respect to the underlying

2980
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:33,760
with respect to the underlying
 

2981
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,589
with respect to the underlying
dimensions

2982
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:35,599
dimensions
 

2983
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,630
dimensions
not how many times we do it.

2984
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:38,640
not how many times we do it.
 

2985
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,390
not how many times we do it.
Because if we keep adding over and over

2986
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:40,400
Because if we keep adding over and over
 

2987
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,069
Because if we keep adding over and over
again order one quantities we will get

2988
01:05:42,069 --> 01:05:42,079
again order one quantities we will get
 

2989
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,230
again order one quantities we will get
bigger quantities. So if we add order

2990
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:44,240
bigger quantities. So if we add order
 

2991
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,349
bigger quantities. So if we add order
one quantities 500 times or let's use

2992
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359
one quantities 500 times or let's use
 

2993
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,029
one quantities 500 times or let's use
order notation. If we add order one

2994
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:49,039
order notation. If we add order one
 

2995
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,349
order notation. If we add order one
quantities k times we get something

2996
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:51,359
quantities k times we get something
 

2997
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,069
quantities k times we get something
that's order k if you start tracking

2998
01:05:54,069 --> 01:05:54,079
that's order k if you start tracking
 

2999
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,710
that's order k if you start tracking
order with respect to k. But we don't

3000
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:56,720
order with respect to k. But we don't
 

3001
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,589
order with respect to k. But we don't
want that. Okay. So one thing we can do

3002
01:05:59,589 --> 01:05:59,599
want that. Okay. So one thing we can do
 

3003
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,349
want that. Okay. So one thing we can do
is just explicitly enforce it. Say let's

3004
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:03,359
is just explicitly enforce it. Say let's
 

3005
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,589
is just explicitly enforce it. Say let's
just put something down such that no

3006
01:06:05,589 --> 01:06:05,599

always going to have RMS norm one. Does
 

3011
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,750
always going to have RMS norm one. Does
everyone see this as an idea? It's like

everyone see this as an idea? It's like
 

3013

everyone see this as an idea? It's like
you want some property to hold. You have

3014
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:13,359
you want some property to hold. You have
 

3015
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,270
you want some property to hold. You have
two choices. You either set up a very

delicate situation where you can prove
 

3019
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,990
delicate situation where you can prove
this property holds or use duct tape and

this property holds or use duct tape and
 

3021
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,950
this property holds or use duct tape and
you force that property to hold.

3022
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:22,960
you force that property to hold.
 

3023
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,789
you force that property to hold.
Okay. Engineering we often like to do

There's like a wonderful meme about
 

3031
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,309
There's like a wonderful meme about
this. Um, but you often want things to

second property which is very nice is
 

3065
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,430
second property which is very nice is
that they also will act as speed bumps

If we have normal layers to like do
everything that we want, do we care

everything that we want, do we care
 

3077
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,750
everything that we want, do we care
about the initialization at all? Like we

3078
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:33,760
about the initialization at all? Like we
 

3079
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,309
about the initialization at all? Like we
still need to do in

3080
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:36,319
still need to do in
 

3081
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,630
still need to do in

3083
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,510
>> uh that's a great question. So the
question was uh if we have if once we're

01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:41,520
question was uh if we have if once we're
 

3085

question was uh if we have if once we're
forcing things to have the right norm

3086
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:44,480
forcing things to have the right norm
 

3087
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,270
forcing things to have the right norm
with respect to RMS norms, do we need to

3088
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:47,280
with respect to RMS norms, do we need to
 

3089
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,510
with respect to RMS norms, do we need to
still enforce the conditions on

3090
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:49,520
still enforce the conditions on
 

3091
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,750
still enforce the conditions on
initialization? And the answer in

3092
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:51,760
initialization? And the answer in
 

3093
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,549
initialization? And the answer in
practice is a little bit yes, you do

3094
01:07:54,549 --> 01:07:54,559
practice is a little bit yes, you do
 

3095
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,470
practice is a little bit yes, you do
need to but you can be it is more

remember the actual condition we wanted

3102
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:03,039
remember the actual condition we wanted
 

3103
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,349
remember the actual condition we wanted
on initialization was we wanted the

3104
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:05,359
on initialization was we wanted the
 

3105
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:09,109
on initialization was we wanted the
spectral norm of this thing to be in the

3106
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:09,119
spectral norm of this thing to be in the
 

3107
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,950
spectral norm of this thing to be in the
right place.

3108
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:10,960
right place.
 

3109
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,029
right place.
Xavier was a way of getting it. But that

3110
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:15,039
Xavier was a way of getting it. But that
 

3111
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:17,430
Xavier was a way of getting it. But that
the spirit of was that we wanted the

3112
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:17,440
the spirit of was that we wanted the
 

3113
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,430
the spirit of was that we wanted the
updates to be the same order as the

3114
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:19,440
updates to be the same order as the
 

3115
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,189
updates to be the same order as the
matrix.

3116
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:21,199
matrix.
 

3117
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:23,669
matrix.
right in terms of it spectral norm. So

3118
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
right in terms of it spectral norm. So
 

3119
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,749
right in terms of it spectral norm. So
we do have that still holds right

3120
01:08:25,749 --> 01:08:25,759
we do have that still holds right
 

3121
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,870
we do have that still holds right
because that gives the right scaling. So

3122
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:26,880
because that gives the right scaling. So
 

3123
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,309
because that gives the right scaling. So
we do still need to make that sure that

3124
01:08:28,309 --> 01:08:28,319
we do still need to make that sure that
 

3125
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,910
we do still need to make that sure that
happens.

3126
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:29,920
happens.
 

3127
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,829
happens.
So even if you put the RMS layer norm

3128
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:31,839
So even if you put the RMS layer norm
 

3129
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,349
So even if you put the RMS layer norm
layers in the same one we have to make

3130
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:33,359
layers in the same one we have to make
 

3131
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,789
layers in the same one we have to make
sure the matrix is still compatible with

3132
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:34,799
sure the matrix is still compatible with
 

3133
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:38,229
sure the matrix is still compatible with
what it would have been with RMS1's.

3134
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:38,239
what it would have been with RMS1's.
 

3135
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:42,470
what it would have been with RMS1's.
Okay. So okay everyone understands what

3136
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,480
Okay. So okay everyone understands what
 

3137
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,789
Okay. So okay everyone understands what
this thing is now trying to do. Now

3138
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:44,799
this thing is now trying to do. Now
 

3139
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:47,990
this thing is now trying to do. Now
let's just see how could we do it. Okay.

3140
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:48,000
let's just see how could we do it. Okay.
 

3141
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,030
let's just see how could we do it. Okay.
So the task assigned to you for one

3142
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,040
So the task assigned to you for one
 

3143
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,229
So the task assigned to you for one
minute is to say give me an operation on

3144
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:54,239
minute is to say give me an operation on
 

3145
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:57,669
minute is to say give me an operation on
a vector such that if I apply that

3146
01:08:57,669 --> 01:08:57,679
a vector such that if I apply that
 

3147
01:08:57,679 --> 01:08:59,990
a vector such that if I apply that
operation to the vector no matter what

3148
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:00,000
operation to the vector no matter what
 

3149
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,470
operation to the vector no matter what
it starts off with assume it's not zero

3150
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:02,480
it starts off with assume it's not zero
 

3151
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,630
it starts off with assume it's not zero
u I will get something that has RMS norm

3152
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:04,640
u I will get something that has RMS norm
 

3153
01:09:04,640 --> 01:10:20,310
u I will get something that has RMS norm
one everyone with me do this one minute

3154
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:20,320

 

3155
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:23,189

Okay,

3156
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
Okay,
 

3157
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:27,750
Okay,
let's everyone come back. So you have a

3158
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:27,760
let's everyone come back. So you have a
 

3159
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,350
let's everyone come back. So you have a
d-dimensional vector.

3160
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:31,360
d-dimensional vector.
 

3161
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,669
d-dimensional vector.
You would like to do something to it

3162
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:33,679
You would like to do something to it
 

3163
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,390
You would like to do something to it
such that the RMS norm is always one.

3164
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:36,400
such that the RMS norm is always one.
 

3165
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,709
such that the RMS norm is always one.
What can we do? Someone want to raise

3166
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:38,719
What can we do? Someone want to raise
 

3167
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,149
What can we do? Someone want to raise
your hand and volunteer?

3168
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:42,159
your hand and volunteer?
 

3169
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:42,870
your hand and volunteer?
>> Yeah.

3170
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:42,880
>> Yeah.
 

3171
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,070
>> Yeah.
>> Subtract the mean.

3172
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,080
>> Subtract the mean.
 

3173
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,110
>> Subtract the mean.
>> Okay. Interesting question. So subtract

3174
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:49,120
>> Okay. Interesting question. So subtract
 

3175
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,630
>> Okay. Interesting question. So subtract
the mean and divide by the standard

3176
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:50,640
the mean and divide by the standard
 

3177
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,990
the mean and divide by the standard
deviation. So I only want this

3178
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:54,000
deviation. So I only want this
 

3179
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,950
deviation. So I only want this
condition.

3180
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:56,960
condition.
 

3181
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,990
condition.
Okay. So, where I could subtract the

3182
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:02,000
Okay. So, where I could subtract the
 

3183
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,390
Okay. So, where I could subtract the
mean and then divide by the standard

3184
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:04,400
mean and then divide by the standard
 

3185
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,750
mean and then divide by the standard
deviation which would give me this. Do I

3186
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:07,760
deviation which would give me this. Do I
 

3187
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,390
deviation which would give me this. Do I
have to do that?

3188
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:12,400

 

3189
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,709

Right. Arms norm just means that we just

3190
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:14,719
Right. Arms norm just means that we just
 

3191
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,630
Right. Arms norm just means that we just
want to make sure the average of the

3192
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:16,640
want to make sure the average of the
 

3193
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:22,709
want to make sure the average of the
squares of all the entries is one.

3194
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:22,719
squares of all the entries is one.
 

3195
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,550
squares of all the entries is one.
Okay, this is subtle. It's like an

3196
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,560
Okay, this is subtle. It's like an
 

3197
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,470
Okay, this is subtle. It's like an
important thing to keep in mind. We are

3198
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:26,480
important thing to keep in mind. We are
 

3199
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,470
important thing to keep in mind. We are
used to subtracting means and we'll talk

3200
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:28,480
used to subtracting means and we'll talk
 

3201
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,470
used to subtracting means and we'll talk
about subtracting means in a bit but in

3202
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:30,480
about subtracting means in a bit but in
 

3203
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,990
about subtracting means in a bit but in
this case there's no need to subtract

3204
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,000
this case there's no need to subtract
 

3205
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,430
this case there's no need to subtract
means. You could do it by subtracting

3206
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:33,440
means. You could do it by subtracting
 

3207
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,110
means. You could do it by subtracting
mean but when we talk when we say an RMS

3208
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,120
mean but when we talk when we say an RMS
 

3209
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,709
mean but when we talk when we say an RMS
norm layer in practice in the deep

3210
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:36,719
norm layer in practice in the deep
 

3211
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,550
norm layer in practice in the deep
learning community we actually don't

3212
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:38,560
learning community we actually don't
 

3213
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,630
learning community we actually don't
mean we mean don't bother subtracting

3214
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:40,640
mean we mean don't bother subtracting
 

3215
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,990
mean we mean don't bother subtracting
the mean. So you're basically in the

3216
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:44,000
the mean. So you're basically in the
 

3217
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,070
the mean. So you're basically in the
same spirit. So all I need to do is

3218
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:46,080
same spirit. So all I need to do is
 

3219
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,110
same spirit. So all I need to do is
scale it. I need to scale it by

3220
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:49,120
scale it. I need to scale it by
 

3221
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,390
scale it. I need to scale it by
something. So this should be a scaling

3222
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:52,400
something. So this should be a scaling
 

3223
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,830
something. So this should be a scaling
Oops. Let me

3224
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:55,840
Oops. Let me
 

3225
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,630
Oops. Let me
use the

3226
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:58,640
use the
 

3227
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,229
use the
color. So this should be proportional

3228
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:02,239
color. So this should be proportional
 

3229
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:05,669
color. So this should be proportional
to HL. But I want to normalize it the

3230
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:05,679
to HL. But I want to normalize it the
 

3231
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:07,510
to HL. But I want to normalize it the
right way.

3232
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:07,520
right way.
 

3233
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,390
right way.
And you are right in what you can

3234
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:10,400
And you are right in what you can
 

3235
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,390
And you are right in what you can
normalize it by is something you can

3236
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:12,400
normalize it by is something you can
 

3237
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,510
normalize it by is something you can
think of as being

3238
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:15,520
think of as being
 

3239
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:21,590
think of as being
s some normalizer where s

3240
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:21,600

 

3241
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,669

is

3242
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:23,679
is
 

3243
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:25,910
is
1 over

3244
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:25,920
1 over
 

3245
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:31,830
1 over
d times the sum over j.

3246
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:31,840
d times the sum over j.
 

3247
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:37,189
d times the sum over j.
Oops.

3248
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199

 

3249
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,630

HLJ squared.

3250
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:40,640
HLJ squared.
 

3251
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,470
HLJ squared.
So it's average. Don't worry about

3252
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:42,480
So it's average. Don't worry about
 

3253
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,830
So it's average. Don't worry about
subtracting the mean. Just compute the

3254
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:43,840
subtracting the mean. Just compute the
 

3255
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,790
subtracting the mean. Just compute the
second moment empirical second moment

3256
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:46,800
second moment empirical second moment
 

3257
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,189
second moment empirical second moment
and take the

3258
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:49,199
and take the
 

3259
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:54,229
and take the
square root of that.

3260
01:12:54,229 --> 01:12:54,239

 

3261
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:57,430

Okay. And if you want to to make sure

3262
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:57,440
Okay. And if you want to to make sure
 

3263
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,310
Okay. And if you want to to make sure
that things are robust, you add another

3264
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:00,320
that things are robust, you add another
 

3265
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,270
that things are robust, you add another
epsilon to make sure you don't

3266
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:01,280
epsilon to make sure you don't
 

3267
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,830
epsilon to make sure you don't
accidentally divide by zero.

3268
01:13:03,830 --> 01:13:03,840
accidentally divide by zero.
 

3269
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,149
accidentally divide by zero.
Okay. Any questions on this?

3270
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:06,159
Okay. Any questions on this?
 

3271
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:11,990
Okay. Any questions on this?
>> Yeah.

3272
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,000

 

3273
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,189

>> Yeah.

3274
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:13,199
>> Yeah.
 

3275
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,709
>> Yeah.

3277
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,390
>> I just was following the way it was
described. Yeah. Another way of doing it

3278
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:16,400

3279
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:28,550

3281
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,430

and then you scale that by the norm

3282
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:33,440
and then you scale that by the norm
 

3283
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:39,990
and then you scale that by the norm
which you need squared d

is this inside is the average second
 

3291
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,270
is this inside is the average second
moment of the entries. Do you see that

3292
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,280
moment of the entries. Do you see that
 

3293
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,950
moment of the entries. Do you see that
second moment? So I'm taking the squares

3294
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:54,960
second moment? So I'm taking the squares
 

3295
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:59,350
second moment? So I'm taking the squares
of everything adding them up dividing by

01:13:59,350 --> 01:13:59,360
of everything adding them up dividing by
 

3297
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,550
of everything adding them up dividing by
D square root of D. Yeah, this this

3298
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:02,560
D square root of D. Yeah, this this
 

3299
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,229
D square root of D. Yeah, this this
should be correct.

3300
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:06,239

 

3301
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:13,510

>> Yeah.

3302
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:13,520

 

3303
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,390

>> Okay. Excellent point. So I wanted to

3304
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,400
>> Okay. Excellent point. So I wanted to
 

3305
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,950
>> Okay. Excellent point. So I wanted to
introduce something that is intuitively

3306
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:18,960
introduce something that is intuitively
 

3307
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,950
introduce something that is intuitively
close to what you've already seen. Right

3308
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:20,960
close to what you've already seen. Right
 

3309
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,950
close to what you've already seen. Right
now this thing has no learnable

3310
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:22,960
now this thing has no learnable
 

3311
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,350
now this thing has no learnable
parameters.

3312
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:25,360
parameters.
 

3313
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,830
parameters.
Okay, it's just I want to make sure the

3314
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:27,840
Okay, it's just I want to make sure the
 

3315
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,189
Okay, it's just I want to make sure the
RMS norm is one. I will do this. This

3316
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:31,199
RMS norm is one. I will do this. This
 

3317
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,350
RMS norm is one. I will do this. This
story becomes intricate but let's let's

3318
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:33,360
story becomes intricate but let's let's
 

3319
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:37,590
story becomes intricate but let's let's
talk about it uh in steps by steps. It

3320
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:37,600
talk about it uh in steps by steps. It
 

3321
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,910
talk about it uh in steps by steps. It
turns out that when one is using

3322
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:39,920
turns out that when one is using
 

3323
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,470
turns out that when one is using
optimizers like muon in many practical

3324
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,480
optimizers like muon in many practical
 

3325
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,790
optimizers like muon in many practical
settings, one actually does want to use

3326
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:44,800
settings, one actually does want to use
 

3327
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,189
settings, one actually does want to use
just straight up RMS norm layers with no

3328
01:14:47,189 --> 01:14:47,199
just straight up RMS norm layers with no
 

3329
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,189
just straight up RMS norm layers with no
learnable parameters

3330
01:14:49,189 --> 01:14:49,199
learnable parameters
 

3331
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,270
learnable parameters
in practice.

3332
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:51,280
in practice.
 

3333
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,709
in practice.
Okay. However, in other settings, one

3334
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:54,719
Okay. However, in other settings, one
 

3335
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,550
Okay. However, in other settings, one
wants normalization layers that have

3336
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:56,560
wants normalization layers that have
 

3337
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,990
wants normalization layers that have
some learnable parameters. So I'll talk

3338
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:58,000
some learnable parameters. So I'll talk
 

3339
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,149
some learnable parameters. So I'll talk
about those next.

3340
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:00,159
about those next.
 

3341
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,390
about those next.
But I do want to acknowledge this. Right

3342
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400
But I do want to acknowledge this. Right
 

3343
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,590
But I do want to acknowledge this. Right
now I've shown something that has no

3344
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:03,600
now I've shown something that has no
 

3345
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,350
now I've shown something that has no
learnable parameters. And this is

3346
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,360
learnable parameters. And this is
 

3347
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,229
learnable parameters. And this is
actually also useful in practice with

3348
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:08,239
actually also useful in practice with
 

3349
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:12,870
actually also useful in practice with
modern optimizers like mu1.

3350
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:12,880

 

3351
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,590

Okay. So

3352
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:15,600
Okay. So
 

3353
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,189
Okay. So
now

3354
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:17,199
now
 

3355
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:20,470
now
here we did something that was sort of

3356
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:20,480
here we did something that was sort of
 

3357
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,790
here we did something that was sort of
uh individual

3358
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:22,800
uh individual
 

3359
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,550
uh individual
uh vector by vector. Does everyone see

3360
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:26,560
uh vector by vector. Does everyone see
 

3361
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,430
uh vector by vector. Does everyone see
that? It's like vector by vector.

3362
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:29,440
that? It's like vector by vector.
 

3363
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,669
that? It's like vector by vector.
Very important. And this kind of vector

3364
01:15:31,669 --> 01:15:31,679
Very important. And this kind of vector
 

3365
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,030
Very important. And this kind of vector
by vector operation is particularly

3366
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:35,040
by vector operation is particularly
 

3367
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,390
by vector operation is particularly
going to be important when we talk about

3368
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,400
going to be important when we talk about
 

3369
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,229
going to be important when we talk about
transformers and state space models and

3370
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:38,239
transformers and state space models and
 

3371
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,550
transformers and state space models and
things like that later. Um but in the

3372
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:40,560
things like that later. Um but in the
 

3373
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,830
things like that later. Um but in the
context of images one often wants to do

3374
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:43,840
context of images one often wants to do
 

3375
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,430
context of images one often wants to do
a little bit more averaging.

3376
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:47,440
a little bit more averaging.
 

3377
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,030
a little bit more averaging.
So

3378
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:49,040
So
 

3379
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,709
So
here's a picture that is people find

3380
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:50,719
here's a picture that is people find
 

3381
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,669
here's a picture that is people find
useful when thinking about what uh kind

3382
01:15:53,669 --> 01:15:53,679
useful when thinking about what uh kind
 

3383
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,430
useful when thinking about what uh kind
of normalizations one can do.

3384
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:57,440
of normalizations one can do.
 

3385
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,430
of normalizations one can do.
What do you have to work with during

3386
01:15:59,430 --> 01:15:59,440
What do you have to work with during
 

3387
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,590
What do you have to work with during
training?

3388
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:01,600
training?
 

3389
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,910
training?
What you have to work with is of course

3390
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:03,920
What you have to work with is of course
 

3391
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,870
What you have to work with is of course
an image. And the image has

3392
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:08,880
an image. And the image has
 

3393
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,470
an image. And the image has
some height and width. So I'm going to

3394
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:10,480
some height and width. So I'm going to
 

3395
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,669
some height and width. So I'm going to
fold them together because it's very

3396
01:16:11,669 --> 01:16:11,679
fold them together because it's very
 

3397
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,750
fold them together because it's very
hard to draw four dimensions. So we can

3398
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:13,760
hard to draw four dimensions. So we can
 

3399
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,510
hard to draw four dimensions. So we can
only draw three. So height and width

3400
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:15,520
only draw three. So height and width
 

3401
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,310
only draw three. So height and width
I'll fold together as being spatial

3402
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:18,320
I'll fold together as being spatial
 

3403
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:24,950
I'll fold together as being spatial
extent. This is like space.

3404
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:24,960

 

3405
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,229

So in addition to space you have

3406
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:28,239
So in addition to space you have
 

3407
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:30,149
So in addition to space you have
channels

3408
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:30,159
channels
 

3409
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,229
channels
the number of different channels. So one

3410
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:32,239
the number of different channels. So one
 

3411
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,790
the number of different channels. So one
of these things

3412
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:34,800
of these things
 

3413
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,709
of these things
is for one input image to your connet

3414
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:38,719
is for one input image to your connet
 

3415
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,790
is for one input image to your connet
what is going on at this particular

3416
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:40,800
what is going on at this particular
 

3417
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,270
what is going on at this particular
layer. Everyone with me? But

3418
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:45,280
layer. Everyone with me? But
 

3419
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,550
layer. Everyone with me? But
you want to during training have batches

3420
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:48,560
you want to during training have batches
 

3421
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,790
you want to during training have batches
that you use. Why do you want batches?

3422
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:50,800
that you use. Why do you want batches?
 

3423
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,990
that you use. Why do you want batches?
Often practically speaking, you want a

3424
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,000
Often practically speaking, you want a
 

3425
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,189
Often practically speaking, you want a
batch because your GPU cannot will not

3426
01:16:57,189 --> 01:16:57,199
batch because your GPU cannot will not
 

3427
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,550
batch because your GPU cannot will not
be saturated by just using one image at

3428
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:00,560
be saturated by just using one image at
 

3429
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,229
be saturated by just using one image at
a time. You have more parallelism in

3430
01:17:02,229 --> 01:17:02,239
a time. You have more parallelism in
 

3431
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,709
a time. You have more parallelism in
your GPU. So you're not going to let it

3432
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
your GPU. So you're not going to let it
 

3433
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,630
your GPU. So you're not going to let it
sit idle, let those tensor cores sit

3434
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:06,640
sit idle, let those tensor cores sit
 

3435
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,550
sit idle, let those tensor cores sit
idle. You want to use them. How do you

3436
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:08,560
idle. You want to use them. How do you
 

3437
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,630
idle. You want to use them. How do you
use them? You put more images in as your

3438
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:12,640
use them? You put more images in as your
 

3439
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,390
use them? You put more images in as your
batch.

3440
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:14,400
batch.
 

3441
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,550
batch.
Okay? So you have a batch.

3442
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:18,560
Okay? So you have a batch.
 

3443
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,149
Okay? So you have a batch.
So you have lots of things that one can

3444
01:17:20,149 --> 01:17:20,159
So you have lots of things that one can
 

3445
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,470
So you have lots of things that one can
average over.

3446
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:22,480
average over.
 

3447
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,110
average over.
So one of the first kinds of

3448
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:25,120
So one of the first kinds of
 

3449
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,110
So one of the first kinds of
normalization layers in the modern era

3450
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,120
normalization layers in the modern era
 

3451
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,950
normalization layers in the modern era
of normalization layers was a

3452
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:28,960
of normalization layers was a
 

3453
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:36,550
of normalization layers was a
normalization layer called batchnorm.

3454
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:36,560

 

3455
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:44,870

What happened here?

3456
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:44,880

 

3457
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,550

So what was batchorm? Bashnorm said

3458
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
So what was batchorm? Bashnorm said
 

3459
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,189
So what was batchorm? Bashnorm said
we're going to do the same thing that we

3460
01:17:51,189 --> 01:17:51,199
we're going to do the same thing that we
 

3461
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:53,830
we're going to do the same thing that we
do for input standardization

3462
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:53,840
do for input standardization
 

3463
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,189
do for input standardization
except we're going to do it at an

3464
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:55,199
except we're going to do it at an
 

3465
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,990
except we're going to do it at an
intermediate layer. So for input

3466
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,000
intermediate layer. So for input
 

3467
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,750
intermediate layer. So for input
standardization what do you do? You take

3468
01:17:59,750 --> 01:17:59,760
standardization what do you do? You take
 

3469
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,229
standardization what do you do? You take
all of your inputs and for every

3470
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:02,239
all of your inputs and for every
 

3471
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,149
all of your inputs and for every
particular position in your input for a

3472
01:18:04,149 --> 01:18:04,159
particular position in your input for a
 

3473
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:07,430
particular position in your input for a
vector input you take the mean subtract

3474
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:07,440
vector input you take the mean subtract
 

3475
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,669
vector input you take the mean subtract
it off and you set set it so that across

3476
01:18:11,669 --> 01:18:11,679
it off and you set set it so that across
 

3477
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,189
it off and you set set it so that across
all your inputs the standard deviation

3478
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
all your inputs the standard deviation
 

3479
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:14,870
all your inputs the standard deviation
is one.

3480
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:14,880
is one.
 

3481
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:19,590
is one.
Okay. So what you do is you do averaging

3482
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:19,600
Okay. So what you do is you do averaging
 

3483
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,350
Okay. So what you do is you do averaging
this way

3484
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:23,360

 

3485
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:27,350

across the batch.

3486
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:27,360

 

3487
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:31,430

But to get more averaging and to respect

3488
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:31,440
But to get more averaging and to respect
 

3489
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,430
But to get more averaging and to respect
the idea of what what your spatial

3490
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:33,440
the idea of what what your spatial
 

3491
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,310
the idea of what what your spatial
filters are like, you also average

3492
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:36,320
filters are like, you also average
 

3493
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,790
filters are like, you also average
across space

3494
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:38,800
across space
 

3495
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:51,750
across space
in a convent.

3496
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:51,760

 

3497
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,270

Okay, so bashnorm does that.

3498
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:55,280
Okay, so bashnorm does that.
 

3499
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:01,030
Okay, so bashnorm does that.
So this averages

3500
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:01,040

 

3501
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,870

over space

3502
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:04,880

 

3503
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,229

and batch

3504
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:08,239

 

3505
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,950

not over channels. The logic behind

3506
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:10,960
not over channels. The logic behind
 

3507
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,950
not over channels. The logic behind
averaging over space is to say that you

3508
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:12,960
averaging over space is to say that you
 

3509
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,189
averaging over space is to say that you
know you might have a cat somewhere in

3510
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:15,199
know you might have a cat somewhere in
 

3511
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,870
know you might have a cat somewhere in
the image.

3512
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:16,880
the image.
 

3513
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,149
the image.
You want to make sure that different

3514
01:19:18,149 --> 01:19:18,159
You want to make sure that different
 

3515
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,189
You want to make sure that different
positions of the image are all

3516
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:19,199
positions of the image are all
 

3517
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:21,669
positions of the image are all
represented. Okay, so you average over

3518
01:19:21,669 --> 01:19:21,679
represented. Okay, so you average over
 

3519
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:24,950
represented. Okay, so you average over
all the entire image.

3520
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
all the entire image.
 

3521
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,070
all the entire image.
So this is uh what batch norm does and

3522
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:28,080
So this is uh what batch norm does and
 

3523
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,790
So this is uh what batch norm does and
let me just write out

3524
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:30,800
let me just write out
 

3525
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,750
let me just write out
uh the expressions. So

3526
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:35,760

 

3527
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,430

let

3528
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:37,440
let
 

3529
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,990
let
curly be you know

3530
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,000
curly be you know
 

3531
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,630
curly be you know
the

3532
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:44,640
the
 

3533
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,390
the
what is

3534
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:48,400

 

3535
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,229

averaged over. Okay. So for the

3536
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:50,239
averaged over. Okay. So for the
 

3537
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,070
averaged over. Okay. So for the
different norms it'll be different. For

3538
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:52,080
different norms it'll be different. For
 

3539
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,870
different norms it'll be different. For
bashn norm it's batch and space.

3540
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:56,880
bashn norm it's batch and space.
 

3541
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:11,910
bashn norm it's batch and space.
You first compute a mean

3542
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:11,920

 

3543
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:16,390

of whatever the input is

3544
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:16,400

 

3545
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,950

then you compute

3546
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:18,960
then you compute
 

3547
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:25,669
then you compute
a scaling factor. So again it as before

3548
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:25,679

 

3549
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:29,830

one over Sorry. The size of

3550
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:29,840
one over Sorry. The size of
 

3551
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:38,950
one over Sorry. The size of
Okay, that's very messy.

3552
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:38,960

 

3553
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:45,110

Sum over everything being averaged

3554
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:45,120

 

3555
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:49,110

hi minus the mean squared.

3556
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:49,120
hi minus the mean squared.
 

3557
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,470
hi minus the mean squared.
>> So this is the standard deviation and

3558
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:50,480
>> So this is the standard deviation and
 

3559
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,910
>> So this is the standard deviation and
this is the mean. Yeah.

3560
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:53,920
this is the mean. Yeah.
 

3561
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,149
this is the mean. Yeah.
using all the locality information.

3562
01:20:56,149 --> 01:20:56,159
using all the locality information.
 

3563
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,310
using all the locality information.
>> Okay, hold on a minute. All I'm trying

3564
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:58,320
>> Okay, hold on a minute. All I'm trying
 

3565
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,870
>> Okay, hold on a minute. All I'm trying
to do is to understand how to scale. I

3566
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:00,880
to do is to understand how to scale. I
 

3567
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,390
to do is to understand how to scale. I
will keep all the locality information.

3568
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:02,400
will keep all the locality information.
 

3569
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,830
will keep all the locality information.
I'm just going to rescale everything.

3570
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:03,840
I'm just going to rescale everything.
 

3571
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,149
I'm just going to rescale everything.
So, I'll just write the next thing out.

3572
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:06,159
So, I'll just write the next thing out.
 

3573
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:11,590
So, I'll just write the next thing out.
What I could do is to say h out,

3574
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:11,600
What I could do is to say h out,
 

3575
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:20,149
What I could do is to say h out,
okay, as a vector is going to be.

3576
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:20,159

 

3577
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,470

So let's look at H out in the in a

3578
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:22,480
So let's look at H out in the in a
 

3579
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:26,149
So let's look at H out in the in a
particular position I comma J H out in

3580
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,159
particular position I comma J H out in
 

3581
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:27,750
particular position I comma J H out in
the I comma J position to keep the

3582
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:27,760
the I comma J position to keep the
 

3583
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,630
the I comma J position to keep the
locality clear. One thing you could do

3584
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:30,640
locality clear. One thing you could do
 

3585
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,630
locality clear. One thing you could do
is just to take H

3586
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:34,640
is just to take H
 

3587
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,149
is just to take H
input.

3588
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:36,159
input.
 

3589
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:40,390
input.
So okay sorry I'll write input in okay H

3590
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:40,400
So okay sorry I'll write input in okay H
 

3591
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,990
So okay sorry I'll write input in okay H
in the I comma J position except I'm

3592
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:44,000
in the I comma J position except I'm
 

3593
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,149
in the I comma J position except I'm
going to subtract the mean

3594
01:21:46,149 --> 01:21:46,159
going to subtract the mean
 

3595
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:49,030
going to subtract the mean
and I will divide by this standard

3596
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:49,040
and I will divide by this standard
 

3597
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,430
and I will divide by this standard
deviation regularized by an epsilon.

3598
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:51,440
deviation regularized by an epsilon.
 

3599
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,790
deviation regularized by an epsilon.
Okay, this would standardize it to have

3600
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:54,800
Okay, this would standardize it to have
 

3601
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:59,030
Okay, this would standardize it to have
average zero over the averaging domain

3602
01:21:59,030 --> 01:21:59,040
average zero over the averaging domain
 

3603
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,830
average zero over the averaging domain
and variance one. Everyone with me with

3604
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:01,840
and variance one. Everyone with me with
 

3605
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:05,830
and variance one. Everyone with me with
this? But in practice, we also add

3606
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:05,840
this? But in practice, we also add
 

3607
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,310
this? But in practice, we also add
learnable parameters. So, sorry, I'm out

3608
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:08,320
learnable parameters. So, sorry, I'm out
 

3609
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:20,229
learnable parameters. So, sorry, I'm out
of time.

3610
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:20,239

 

3611
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:21,669

Okay. So, I'll pick up here next time

3612
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
Okay. So, I'll pick up here next time
 

3613
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,030
Okay. So, I'll pick up here next time
and continue with the other other

3614
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:23,040
and continue with the other other
 

3615
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:32,390
and continue with the other other
normalization layers next time.

3616
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:32,400

 

3617
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,550

Did you think of batch norm as kind of

3618
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:34,560
Did you think of batch norm as kind of
 

3619
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,189
Did you think of batch norm as kind of
like getting rid of an implicit bias

3620
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:37,199
like getting rid of an implicit bias
 

3621
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:40,310
like getting rid of an implicit bias
across batches because then like batches

3622
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:40,320
across batches because then like batches
 

3623
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,550
across batches because then like batches
in one channel where like maybe the

3624
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:42,560
in one channel where like maybe the
 

3625
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,870
in one channel where like maybe the
values are higher those would have minor

3626
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:44,880
values are higher those would have minor
 

3627
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,510
values are higher those would have minor
gradients of the loss. So you're kind of

3628
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:47,520
gradients of the loss. So you're kind of
 

3629
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,950
gradients of the loss. So you're kind of
like

3630
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:48,960
like
 

3631
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,470
like
