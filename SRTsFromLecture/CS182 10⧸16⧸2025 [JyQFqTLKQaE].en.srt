1
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,110

Okay, let's start. So last time we just

2
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
Okay, let's start. So last time we just
 

3
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,670
Okay, let's start. So last time we just
barely started RNN's. We want to kind of

4
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
barely started RNN's. We want to kind of
 

5
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,069
barely started RNN's. We want to kind of
do a bunch of RNN stuff and then get

6
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
do a bunch of RNN stuff and then get
 

7
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,270
do a bunch of RNN stuff and then get
into this concept of self-s supervision

8
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
into this concept of self-s supervision
 

9
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,069
into this concept of self-s supervision
just naturally um comes from here. Uh as

10
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
just naturally um comes from here. Uh as
 

11
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,070
just naturally um comes from here. Uh as
I mentioned before what we're talking

12
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
I mentioned before what we're talking
 

13
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,510
I mentioned before what we're talking
about today uh very little of it is in

14
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
about today uh very little of it is in
 

15
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,350
about today uh very little of it is in
the prince's textbook on the

16
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
the prince's textbook on the
 

17
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,270
the prince's textbook on the
self-supvision material. There's like

18
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
self-supvision material. There's like
 

19
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,790
self-supvision material. There's like
one paragraph in 9.3.7 maybe two

20
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
one paragraph in 9.3.7 maybe two
 

21
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,030
one paragraph in 9.3.7 maybe two
paragraphs. So you can look at that but

22
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040
paragraphs. So you can look at that but
 

23
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,990
paragraphs. So you can look at that but
uh we're going to talk about a little

24
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
uh we're going to talk about a little
 

25
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,870
uh we're going to talk about a little
bit more um than than what's there and

26
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
bit more um than than what's there and
 

27
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,310
bit more um than than what's there and
as I said before the uh older deep

28
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
as I said before the uh older deep
 

29
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,350
as I said before the uh older deep
learning book.org has good treatment of

30
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
learning book.org has good treatment of
 

31
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,950
learning book.org has good treatment of
classical uh RNN material but the way

32
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
classical uh RNN material but the way
 

33
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,710
classical uh RNN material but the way
that we're going to be presenting it is

34
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
that we're going to be presenting it is
 

35
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,070
that we're going to be presenting it is
different and especially what will

36
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
different and especially what will
 

37
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,590
different and especially what will
happen next week is very new and uh not

38
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
happen next week is very new and uh not
 

39
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,150
happen next week is very new and uh not
in any textbook.

40
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
in any textbook.
 

41
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,790
in any textbook.
So

42
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
So
 

43
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,629
So
uh recall RNN's before 2018 were one of

44
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
uh recall RNN's before 2018 were one of
 

45
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,990
uh recall RNN's before 2018 were one of
the big successes uh of uh deep learning

46
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
the big successes uh of uh deep learning
 

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,710
the big successes uh of uh deep learning
uh just like CNN's were for image and

48
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
uh just like CNN's were for image and
 

49
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,189
uh just like CNN's were for image and
their domain was language and speech and

50
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
their domain was language and speech and
 

51
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,710
their domain was language and speech and
those natural language processing is

52
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
those natural language processing is
 

53
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,029
those natural language processing is
extremely important by that time uh

54
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
extremely important by that time uh
 

55
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,469
extremely important by that time uh
these were deployed in production

56
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
these were deployed in production
 

57
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,710
these were deployed in production

59
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,830
systems you know at scale at places like
Google and

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
Google and
 

61
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,990

the key issue in language and speech

62
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
the key issue in language and speech
 

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,430
the key issue in language and speech
along with many other domains like

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
along with many other domains like
 

65
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,350

control and time series is that you have

66
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
control and time series is that you have
 

67
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,189
control and time series is that you have
data that's sequential

68
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
data that's sequential
 

69
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,469
data that's sequential
uh in nature and in some of those cases

70
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
uh in nature and in some of those cases
 

71
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,629
uh in nature and in some of those cases
it's also causal like one thing follows

72
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
it's also causal like one thing follows
 

73
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,310
it's also causal like one thing follows
the other in a very important way.

74
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
the other in a very important way.
 

75
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,310
the other in a very important way.
Language is a little bit iffy on that

76
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
Language is a little bit iffy on that
 

77
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,189
Language is a little bit iffy on that
but is still mostly causal. So we last

78
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
but is still mostly causal. So we last
 

79
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,670
but is still mostly causal. So we last
time we mentioned that from a classical

80
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
time we mentioned that from a classical
 

81
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,510
time we mentioned that from a classical
signal processing uh perspective we have

82
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
signal processing uh perspective we have
 

83
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,670
signal processing uh perspective we have
uh two kinds of filters that we use.

84
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
uh two kinds of filters that we use.
 

85
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,150
uh two kinds of filters that we use.
There's fir filters which are finite

86
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
There's fir filters which are finite
 

87
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,550
There's fir filters which are finite
impulse response filters and those have

88
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
impulse response filters and those have
 

89
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,749
impulse response filters and those have
a are completely directly map over to

90
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
a are completely directly map over to
 

91
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,430
a are completely directly map over to
cons and CNN's uh in neural nets and the

92
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
cons and CNN's uh in neural nets and the
 

93
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,950
cons and CNN's uh in neural nets and the
weight sharing that that reflects in

94
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
weight sharing that that reflects in
 

95
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,510
weight sharing that that reflects in
neural network is across space. Now

96
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
neural network is across space. Now
 

97
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,870
neural network is across space. Now
there's also I filters uh infinite

98
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
there's also I filters uh infinite
 

99
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,350
there's also I filters uh infinite
impulse response filters and it's really

100
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
impulse response filters and it's really
 

101
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,670
impulse response filters and it's really
important to remember the fact that for

102
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
important to remember the fact that for
 

103
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,350
important to remember the fact that for
you know the opposite of finite is

104
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
you know the opposite of finite is
 

105
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,749
you know the opposite of finite is
infinite and there is a vast range of

106
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
infinite and there is a vast range of
 

107
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,790
infinite and there is a vast range of
possible in principle existing infinite

108
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
possible in principle existing infinite
 

109
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,230
possible in principle existing infinite
impulse response filters. However, uh in

110
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
impulse response filters. However, uh in
 

111
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,309
impulse response filters. However, uh in
engineering practice for tractability,

112
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
engineering practice for tractability,
 

113
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,870
engineering practice for tractability,
we can only build things that are finite

114
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
we can only build things that are finite
 

115
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,550
we can only build things that are finite
in some very real sense. They have to be

116
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
in some very real sense. They have to be
 

117
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,110
in some very real sense. They have to be
finitely implementable.

118
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
finitely implementable.
 

119
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,230
finitely implementable.
And so the standard way in signal

120
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
And so the standard way in signal
 

121
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,469
And so the standard way in signal
processing is to have a finite

122
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
processing is to have a finite
 

123
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,469
processing is to have a finite
dimensional hidden state inside the

124
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
dimensional hidden state inside the
 

125
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,950
dimensional hidden state inside the
filter. So these are filters that have

126
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
filter. So these are filters that have
 

127
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,670
filter. So these are filters that have
memory and what you do is you use this

128
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
memory and what you do is you use this
 

129
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,309
memory and what you do is you use this
filter with memory in a because it has

130
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
filter with memory in a because it has
 

131
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,790
filter with memory in a because it has
memory it's fundamentally sequential and

132
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
memory it's fundamentally sequential and
 

133
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,189
memory it's fundamentally sequential and
causal whereas FIR filters you don't

134
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
causal whereas FIR filters you don't
 

135
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,189
causal whereas FIR filters you don't
have to think about sequentiality for

136
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
have to think about sequentiality for
 

137
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,749
have to think about sequentiality for
them but IR filters in engineering

138
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
them but IR filters in engineering
 

139
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,189
them but IR filters in engineering
practice in signal processing are

140
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
practice in signal processing are
 

141
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,350
practice in signal processing are
fundamentally causal um so those are

142
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
fundamentally causal um so those are
 

143
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,029
fundamentally causal um so those are
what translate into this box of RNNs and

144
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
what translate into this box of RNNs and
 

145
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,390
what translate into this box of RNNs and
the important thing here is weight

146
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
the important thing here is weight
 

147
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,950
the important thing here is weight
sharing exists across time not across

148
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
sharing exists across time not across
 

149
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,189
sharing exists across time not across
space.

150
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
space.
 

151
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,830
space.
So let's just uh think about what's

152
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
So let's just uh think about what's
 

153
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,230
So let's just uh think about what's
inside an IR filter. So we said there's

154
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
inside an IR filter. So we said there's
 

155
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,909
inside an IR filter. So we said there's
a hidden finite dimensional state in the

156
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
a hidden finite dimensional state in the
 

157
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,110
a hidden finite dimensional state in the
kinds that we use in uh SP and

158
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,120
kinds that we use in uh SP and
 

159
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,230
kinds that we use in uh SP and
these are linear filters. So there's a

160
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
these are linear filters. So there's a
 

161
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,670
these are linear filters. So there's a
hidden state and the hidden state

162
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
hidden state and the hidden state
 

163
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,990
hidden state and the hidden state
usually we set up as having a recursive

164
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
usually we set up as having a recursive
 

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,710
usually we set up as having a recursive
update. So a linear update. So we have

166
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
update. So a linear update. So we have
 

167
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,150
update. So a linear update. So we have
an input. So we want to take a filter

168
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
an input. So we want to take a filter
 

169
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,150
an input. So we want to take a filter
that takes entire long sequences UT and

170
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
that takes entire long sequences UT and
 

171
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,950
that takes entire long sequences UT and
causely maps them into an output

172
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
causely maps them into an output
 

173
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,469
causely maps them into an output
sequence Y that has desirable

174
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
sequence Y that has desirable
 

175
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,710
sequence Y that has desirable
properties. That's the goal of a filter,

176
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
properties. That's the goal of a filter,
 

177
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,070
properties. That's the goal of a filter,
right? Takes something in across time

178
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,080
right? Takes something in across time
 

179
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,869
right? Takes something in across time
and return something else across time.

180
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
and return something else across time.
 

181
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,589
and return something else across time.
And the way that we do it is first we

182
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
And the way that we do it is first we
 

183
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,670
And the way that we do it is first we
update the hidden state. So we have a

184
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
update the hidden state. So we have a
 

185
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,189
update the hidden state. So we have a
generic linear update on the hidden

186
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
generic linear update on the hidden
 

187
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,510
generic linear update on the hidden
state. There's some weight set of

188
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
state. There's some weight set of
 

189
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,830
state. There's some weight set of
weights that tell you how to take the

190
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
weights that tell you how to take the
 

191
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,230
weights that tell you how to take the
previous state you had and do an update

192
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
previous state you had and do an update
 

193
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,390
previous state you had and do an update
to them. And then you have another set

194
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
to them. And then you have another set
 

195
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,950
to them. And then you have another set
of weights B that tell you how to digest

196
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
of weights B that tell you how to digest
 

197
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,790
of weights B that tell you how to digest
an input and combine it into your state.

198
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
an input and combine it into your state.
 

199
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,389
an input and combine it into your state.
So what this is doing is the hidden

200
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
So what this is doing is the hidden
 

201
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,190
So what this is doing is the hidden
state is a constantly running summary

202
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
state is a constantly running summary
 

203
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,550
state is a constantly running summary
of the appropriate parts of the input.

204
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
of the appropriate parts of the input.
 

205
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,750
of the appropriate parts of the input.
Okay, that's a way of interpreting it.

206
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
Okay, that's a way of interpreting it.
 

207
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,190
Okay, that's a way of interpreting it.
Now you have to generate an output. So

208
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
Now you have to generate an output. So
 

209
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,670
Now you have to generate an output. So
in traditional uh linear filter uh

210
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
in traditional uh linear filter uh
 

211
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,389
in traditional uh linear filter uh
design you think of the fil the output

212
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
design you think of the fil the output
 

213
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,110
design you think of the fil the output
as having a combination of two things.

214
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,120
as having a combination of two things.
 

215
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,990
as having a combination of two things.
It's a linear projection of some kind of

216
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
It's a linear projection of some kind of
 

217
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,430
It's a linear projection of some kind of
h some matrix C that takes the hidden

218
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
h some matrix C that takes the hidden
 

219
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,509
h some matrix C that takes the hidden
state and does a linear map to it.

220
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
state and does a linear map to it.
 

221
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,550
state and does a linear map to it.
Remember the dimensions of U, H, and Y

222
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
Remember the dimensions of U, H, and Y
 

223
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,949
Remember the dimensions of U, H, and Y
can all be different. the matrices have

224
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
can all be different. the matrices have
 

225
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,829
can all be different. the matrices have
the right sizes to make things work.

226
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
the right sizes to make things work.
 

227
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,470
the right sizes to make things work.
So that's one part of it. So the but you

228
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
So that's one part of it. So the but you
 

229
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,030
So that's one part of it. So the but you
can also have a feed forward component

230
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,040
can also have a feed forward component
 

231
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,870
can also have a feed forward component
represented by D which is just uh

232
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
represented by D which is just uh
 

233
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,190
represented by D which is just uh
representation of the current input

234
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
representation of the current input
 

235
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,350
representation of the current input
transformed linearly in the current

236
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
transformed linearly in the current
 

237
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,910
transformed linearly in the current
output.

238
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
output.
 

239
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,509
output.
So for those of people who've taught

240
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
So for those of people who've taught
 

241
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,350
So for those of people who've taught
about uh you know linear uh filter

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
design in other classes you know this
 

245
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,150
design in other classes you know this
kind of structure if people think about

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
kind of structure if people think about
 

247
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,990
kind of structure if people think about
in terms of like if you've seen it

248
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
in terms of like if you've seen it
 

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,350
in terms of like if you've seen it
you're not required for this class

250
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
you're not required for this class
 

251
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,030
you're not required for this class
things like rational transfer functions

252
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
things like rational transfer functions
 

253
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,150
things like rational transfer functions
and things like that you know the

254
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
and things like that you know the
 

255
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,470
and things like that you know the
this is where the poles are coming from

256
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
this is where the poles are coming from
 

257
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,389
this is where the poles are coming from
and this is where the stuff in the

258
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
and this is where the stuff in the
 

259
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,990
and this is where the stuff in the
numerator is largely coming from. Right?

260
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
numerator is largely coming from. Right?
 

261
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,150
numerator is largely coming from. Right?
This is like a in case you're trying to

262
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
This is like a in case you're trying to
 

263
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,670
This is like a in case you're trying to
if you've seen that stuff, it's a way of

264
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
if you've seen that stuff, it's a way of
 

265
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,269
if you've seen that stuff, it's a way of
kind of bringing it back into memory in

266
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
kind of bringing it back into memory in
 

267
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,550
kind of bringing it back into memory in
case you were thinking of it

268
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
case you were thinking of it
 

269
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,070
case you were thinking of it
fundamentally in transfer function land

270
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,080
fundamentally in transfer function land
 

271
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,310
fundamentally in transfer function land
as opposed to as a recurrence.

272
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
as opposed to as a recurrence.
 

273
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,670
as opposed to as a recurrence.
Okay, so this is the kinds of

274
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
Okay, so this is the kinds of
 

275
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,949
Okay, so this is the kinds of
linear IR filters that we know from

276
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
linear IR filters that we know from
 

277
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,910
linear IR filters that we know from
engineering practice for decades. Yeah,

278
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
engineering practice for decades. Yeah,
 

279
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,990
engineering practice for decades. Yeah,
>> I think could be zero because we have

281
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,630
>> I think could be zero because we have

282
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
>> Excellent question. The question is you
 

283
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,949
>> Excellent question. The question is you
could set d to zero and that's totally

284
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
could set d to zero and that's totally
 

285
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,430
could set d to zero and that's totally
reasonable. you you can have d be zero

286
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
reasonable. you you can have d be zero
 

287
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,829
reasonable. you you can have d be zero
but d actually does add a little bit of

288
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
but d actually does add a little bit of
 

289
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,630
but d actually does add a little bit of
expressive power uh to this setup than

290
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
expressive power uh to this setup than
 

291
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,389
expressive power uh to this setup than
just b because think about the sizes

292
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
just b because think about the sizes
 

293
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,750
just b because think about the sizes
right if suppose u was uh suppose h is

294
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
right if suppose u was uh suppose h is
 

295
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,350
right if suppose u was uh suppose h is
very small in size and u is bigger and y

296
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
very small in size and u is bigger and y
 

297
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,990
very small in size and u is bigger and y
is also bigger

298
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
is also bigger
 

299
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,030
is also bigger
okay so if uh h is small u is big and y

300
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
okay so if uh h is small u is big and y
 

301
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,630
okay so if uh h is small u is big and y
is also big then this is squishing

302
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
is also big then this is squishing
 

303
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,590
is also big then this is squishing
information down into just h. So to only

304
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
information down into just h. So to only
 

305
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,750
information down into just h. So to only
have that represent in the output is a

306
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
have that represent in the output is a
 

307
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,990
have that represent in the output is a
limitation. Whereas here you can have

308
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
limitation. Whereas here you can have
 

309
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,550
limitation. Whereas here you can have
more of you come through but only in the

310
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
more of you come through but only in the
 

311
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,470
more of you come through but only in the
current. The past is going to be

312
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
current. The past is going to be
 

313
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,470
current. The past is going to be
dependent only on what the hidden state

314
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
dependent only on what the hidden state
 

315
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,550
dependent only on what the hidden state
can summarize but the current could be

316
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
can summarize but the current could be
 

317
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,150
can summarize but the current could be
more. Okay. Um so this is a generic

318
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
more. Okay. Um so this is a generic
 

319
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,710
more. Okay. Um so this is a generic
picture uh that one can have.

320
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
picture uh that one can have.
 

321
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,910
picture uh that one can have.
So what we're going to think about now

322
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
So what we're going to think about now
 

323
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,670
So what we're going to think about now
is how do we take this idea and map it

324
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
is how do we take this idea and map it
 

325
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,150
is how do we take this idea and map it
into neural netland. Okay. And the basic

326
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
into neural netland. Okay. And the basic
 

327
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,069
into neural netland. Okay. And the basic
thing that we want to do is to keep this

328
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
thing that we want to do is to keep this
 

329
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,389
thing that we want to do is to keep this
picture in mind.

330
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399

 

331
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,550

So this picture is saying I want to

332
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
So this picture is saying I want to
 

333
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,990
So this picture is saying I want to
populate this box with something

334
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
populate this box with something
 

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,630
populate this box with something
in which what I want to do is to ask the

336
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
in which what I want to do is to ask the
 

337
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,470
in which what I want to do is to ask the
question whatever I was doing with a con

338
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:46,480
question whatever I was doing with a con
 

339
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,750
question whatever I was doing with a con
in a CNN I want to do with this. Does

340
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
in a CNN I want to do with this. Does
 

341
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,430
in a CNN I want to do with this. Does
everyone see the kind of analogy we're

342
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
everyone see the kind of analogy we're
 

343
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,630
everyone see the kind of analogy we're
doing? So wherever we have cons we want

344
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:54,640
doing? So wherever we have cons we want
 

345
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,630
doing? So wherever we have cons we want
to replace it with this kind of thing.

346
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:56,640
to replace it with this kind of thing.
 

347
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,670
to replace it with this kind of thing.
This is the kind of spirit of uh

348
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
This is the kind of spirit of uh
 

349
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,509
This is the kind of spirit of uh
you know what we're doing.

350
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
you know what we're doing.
 

351
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,590
you know what we're doing.
So if we do that

352
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
So if we do that
 

353
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,550
So if we do that
the kind of standard minimalist approach

354
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
the kind of standard minimalist approach
 

355
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,629
the kind of standard minimalist approach
is going to be all of the design ideas

356
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
is going to be all of the design ideas
 

357
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,629
is going to be all of the design ideas
and principles we learned in CNN's which

358
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
and principles we learned in CNN's which
 

359
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,710
and principles we learned in CNN's which
we then generalized one way into graph

360
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
we then generalized one way into graph
 

361
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,110
we then generalized one way into graph
neural nets. We're going to generalize

362
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:19,120
neural nets. We're going to generalize
 

363
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,550
neural nets. We're going to generalize
them a different way into RNMs. So we'll

364
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
them a different way into RNMs. So we'll
 

365
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,389
them a different way into RNMs. So we'll
try to keep everything we can just

366
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
try to keep everything we can just
 

367
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,870
try to keep everything we can just
replace space with time and we'll have

368
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
replace space with time and we'll have
 

369
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,670
replace space with time and we'll have
to because of the limitation of this

370
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
to because of the limitation of this
 

371
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,509
to because of the limitation of this
kind of processing we're going to have

372
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
kind of processing we're going to have
 

373
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,069
kind of processing we're going to have
to enforce causality. Everything will

374
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
to enforce causality. Everything will
 

375
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,829
to enforce causality. Everything will
have to be causal and time will move in

376
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
have to be causal and time will move in
 

377
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,990
have to be causal and time will move in
one direction for processing.

378
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
one direction for processing.
 

379
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,670
one direction for processing.
It's not that we necessarily want this

380
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
It's not that we necessarily want this
 

381
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,470
It's not that we necessarily want this
causality. We have no choice. We have to

382
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
causality. We have no choice. We have to
 

383
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,310
causality. We have no choice. We have to
live with it. And so there are

384
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
live with it. And so there are
 

385
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,870
live with it. And so there are
workarounds that people used to do in

386
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
workarounds that people used to do in
 

387
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,430
workarounds that people used to do in
old school um RNNs to get around that

388
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
old school um RNNs to get around that
 

389
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,949
old school um RNNs to get around that
when you wanted non-causal uh

390
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
when you wanted non-causal uh
 

391
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,269
when you wanted non-causal uh
processing. They kind of run time in one

392
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,279
processing. They kind of run time in one
 

393
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,629
processing. They kind of run time in one
direction and then they run time in the

394
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
direction and then they run time in the
 

395
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,150
direction and then they run time in the
opposite direction and they run time in

396
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
opposite direction and they run time in
 

397
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,430
opposite direction and they run time in
this direction again and they kind of

398
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
this direction again and they kind of
 

399
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,590
this direction again and they kind of
interle time in different directions.

400
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
interle time in different directions.
 

401
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,269
interle time in different directions.
Okay. So what I want to do is just draw

402
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
Okay. So what I want to do is just draw
 

403
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,430
Okay. So what I want to do is just draw
a symbol like a pictorial picture here

404
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
a symbol like a pictorial picture here
 

405
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,750
a symbol like a pictorial picture here
of what we're talking about. Okay. So

406
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
of what we're talking about. Okay. So
 

407
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,030
of what we're talking about. Okay. So
here is the uh picture.

408
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
here is the uh picture.
 

409
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,790
here is the uh picture.
So in this picture, what we're going to

410
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
So in this picture, what we're going to
 

411
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,750
So in this picture, what we're going to
do is we're going to think about how

412
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:19,760
do is we're going to think about how
 

413
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,829
do is we're going to think about how
things are flowing.

414
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
things are flowing.
 

415
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,710
things are flowing.
So I'm going to put time on the

416
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
So I'm going to put time on the
 

417
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,910
So I'm going to put time on the
horizontal axis.

418
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
horizontal axis.
 

419
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,310
horizontal axis.
Why? Because we write English this way.

420
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
Why? Because we write English this way.
 

421
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,949
Why? Because we write English this way.
Okay. Um this causes a change because

422
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
Okay. Um this causes a change because
 

423
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,790
Okay. Um this causes a change because
then what you saw in continents because

424
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
then what you saw in continents because
 

425
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,269
then what you saw in continents because
in continents for historical tradition

426
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
in continents for historical tradition
 

427
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,190
in continents for historical tradition
you think about information processing

428
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,200
you think about information processing
 

429
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,590
you think about information processing
and depth in the horizontal axis in

430
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
and depth in the horizontal axis in
 

431
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,310
and depth in the horizontal axis in
continents but here we're kind of

432
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
continents but here we're kind of
 

433
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,710
continents but here we're kind of
conflicted. We have to put depth

434
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
conflicted. We have to put depth
 

435
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,269
conflicted. We have to put depth
somewhere of the network and sequence in

436
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
somewhere of the network and sequence in
 

437
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,710
somewhere of the network and sequence in
some direction. And the convention is to

438
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
some direction. And the convention is to
 

439
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,550
some direction. And the convention is to
put sequence in the horizontal direction

440
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
put sequence in the horizontal direction
 

441
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,550
put sequence in the horizontal direction
and put depth in the vertical dimension.

442
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
and put depth in the vertical dimension.
 

443
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,870
and put depth in the vertical dimension.
Okay, just to take a picture of what's

444
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
Okay, just to take a picture of what's
 

445
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,629
Okay, just to take a picture of what's
going on.

446
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
going on.
 

447
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,949
going on.
So what we're going to have is we're

448
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
So what we're going to have is we're
 

449
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,230
So what we're going to have is we're
going to have each of these boxes is

450
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
going to have each of these boxes is
 

451
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,069
going to have each of these boxes is
going to be

452
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079

 

453
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,670

you can think of this entire thing here.

454
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
you can think of this entire thing here.
 

455
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:39,750
you can think of this entire thing here.
This is just a box.

456
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760

 

457
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,069

Okay, does everyone see this? And you

458
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
Okay, does everyone see this? And you
 

459
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,750
Okay, does everyone see this? And you
could have imagine the output coming out

460
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
could have imagine the output coming out
 

461
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,710
could have imagine the output coming out
of this side as being y

462
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720

 

463
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,590

as an example.

464
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
as an example.
 

465
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,790
as an example.
Does everyone see how we can think about

466
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
Does everyone see how we can think about
 

467
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,350
Does everyone see how we can think about
this as a box?

468
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
this as a box?
 

469
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,310
this as a box?
So now what we're going to do is we're

470
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
So now what we're going to do is we're
 

471
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,269
So now what we're going to do is we're
going to like just stack these boxes as

472
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
going to like just stack these boxes as
 

473
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:06,069
going to like just stack these boxes as
components.

474
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079

 

475
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,189

So we're going to make these are going

476
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
So we're going to make these are going
 

477
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,710
So we're going to make these are going
to be neural net layers that we're going

478
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
to be neural net layers that we're going
 

479
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,230
to be neural net layers that we're going
to stack up and those boxes are going to

480
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
to stack up and those boxes are going to
 

481
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,910
to stack up and those boxes are going to
play the role of a con

482
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
play the role of a con
 

483
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,750
play the role of a con
everyone. This is really important that

484
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
everyone. This is really important that
 

485
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,790
everyone. This is really important that
everyone understand what we're doing

486
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
everyone understand what we're doing
 

487
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,509
everyone understand what we're doing
here. Okay.

488
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
here. Okay.
 

489
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,590
here. Okay.
So I'll pause for questions. Yeah. Is

490
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
So I'll pause for questions. Yeah. Is
 

491
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,269
So I'll pause for questions. Yeah. Is
the box just a single weight plus bias?

492
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279
the box just a single weight plus bias?
 

493
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,829
the box just a single weight plus bias?
>> So the box that entire box is represents

494
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
>> So the box that entire box is represents
 

495
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,230
>> So the box that entire box is represents
this thing. We'll add a bias in a bit.

496
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
this thing. We'll add a bias in a bit.
 

497
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,550
this thing. We'll add a bias in a bit.
The traditional way doesn't have a bias

498
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:40,560
The traditional way doesn't have a bias
 

499
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,829
The traditional way doesn't have a bias
in the traditional signal processing

500
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
in the traditional signal processing
 

501
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,990
in the traditional signal processing
when doesn't typically have biases, but

502
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
when doesn't typically have biases, but
 

503
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,670
when doesn't typically have biases, but
we're going to add a bias. So yeah,

504
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
we're going to add a bias. So yeah,
 

505
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,430
we're going to add a bias. So yeah,
there'll be this kind of stuff which is

506
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
there'll be this kind of stuff which is
 

507
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,629
there'll be this kind of stuff which is
a bunch of weights and a bias in the box

508
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
a bunch of weights and a bias in the box
 

509
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,910
a bunch of weights and a bias in the box
down here. We'll we'll soon get to that.

510
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:53,920
down here. We'll we'll soon get to that.
 

511
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,150
down here. We'll we'll soon get to that.
But yeah, the big picture is that this

512
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
But yeah, the big picture is that this
 

513
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,790
But yeah, the big picture is that this
is replacing a con.

514
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
is replacing a con.
 

515
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,910
is replacing a con.
And what we're going to do is that

516
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
And what we're going to do is that
 

517
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,670
And what we're going to do is that
little purple box, you can think of that

518
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
little purple box, you can think of that
 

519
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,110
little purple box, you can think of that
purple box as being

520
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
purple box as being
 

521
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,870
purple box as being
inside here.

522
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880

 

523
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,430

Okay, that purple box above goes in

524
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
Okay, that purple box above goes in
 

525
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,670
Okay, that purple box above goes in
here. And so it's the one

526
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680

 

527
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,590

that's

528
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
that's
 

529
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,150
that's
connecting in the horizontal direction.

530
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160

 

531
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,629

But like we did in CN in CNN's, we can

532
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
But like we did in CN in CNN's, we can
 

533
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,230
But like we did in CN in CNN's, we can
put other things inside this box too,

534
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
put other things inside this box too,
 

535
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,310
put other things inside this box too,
right? So we could put an MLP inside the

536
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:36,320
right? So we could put an MLP inside the
 

537
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,990
right? So we could put an MLP inside the
box. We could put, you know, other kinds

538
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
box. We could put, you know, other kinds
 

539
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,230
box. We could put, you know, other kinds
of objects that only act on information

540
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
of objects that only act on information
 

541
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,910
of objects that only act on information
from

542
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
from
 

543
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,069
from
this particular

544
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079
this particular
 

545
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,910
this particular
stack.

546
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
stack.
 

547
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,590
stack.
Does everyone see that? It's like the

548
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
Does everyone see that? It's like the
 

549
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,110
Does everyone see that? It's like the
same thing we did in continents. We can

550
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
same thing we did in continents. We can
 

551
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,430
same thing we did in continents. We can
do the same thing here.

552
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
do the same thing here.
 

553
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,189
do the same thing here.
We could have other stuff. I just mark

554
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
We could have other stuff. I just mark
 

555
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,189
We could have other stuff. I just mark
it as some other stuff

556
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199

 

557
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,990

inside the box.

558
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000

 

559
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,870

So first is let's just think about other

560
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
So first is let's just think about other
 

561
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,470
So first is let's just think about other
design things that we had. These are

562
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
design things that we had. These are
 

563
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,789
design things that we had. These are
things that carry over. If I want to add

564
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
things that carry over. If I want to add
 

565
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,909
things that carry over. If I want to add
residual connections in the vertical

566
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
residual connections in the vertical
 

567
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,829
residual connections in the vertical
direction, that's just the same as we

568
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
direction, that's just the same as we
 

569
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,069
direction, that's just the same as we
did before. We did them in GNN's also we

570
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
did before. We did them in GNN's also we
 

571
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,350
did before. We did them in GNN's also we
said we could do them in GNN's we did

572
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,360
said we could do them in GNN's we did
 

573
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,230
said we could do them in GNN's we did
them in CNN's we can do them here so

574
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
them in CNN's we can do them here so
 

575
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,270
them in CNN's we can do them here so
this just works we can have things like

576
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
this just works we can have things like
 

577
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,590
this just works we can have things like
vertical one by one MLPS one by one I'm

578
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
vertical one by one MLPS one by one I'm
 

579
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,470
vertical one by one MLPS one by one I'm
using con language here this is like con

580
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
using con language here this is like con
 

581
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,990
using con language here this is like con
language

582
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000

 

583
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,990

okay

584
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
okay
 

585
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,789
okay
and we can also put normalizations in

586
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
and we can also put normalizations in
 

587
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,029
and we can also put normalizations in
the vertical direction

588
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
the vertical direction
 

589
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,350
the vertical direction
okay where the normalizations they're

590
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
okay where the normalizations they're
 

591
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,630
okay where the normalizations they're
like the same kind kind of thing we said

592
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
like the same kind kind of thing we said
 

593
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,990
like the same kind kind of thing we said
for GNN's we just do like an RMS norm of

594
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
for GNN's we just do like an RMS norm of
 

595
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,630
for GNN's we just do like an RMS norm of
the vector but you don't look at other

596
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,640
the vector but you don't look at other
 

597
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,110
the vector but you don't look at other
things in the graph here that's very

598
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
things in the graph here that's very
 

599
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,950
things in the graph here that's very
important we're not allowed to average

600
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:58,960
important we're not allowed to average
 

601
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,549
important we're not allowed to average
across time into the future because the

602
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
across time into the future because the
 

603
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,150
across time into the future because the
future doesn't exist yet

604
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
future doesn't exist yet
 

605
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,630
future doesn't exist yet
okay so that's not legal we can't look

606
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
okay so that's not legal we can't look
 

607
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,710
okay so that's not legal we can't look
into the future so we have to just be

608
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:08,720
into the future so we have to just be
 

609
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,830
into the future so we have to just be
looking right here for the

610
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
looking right here for the
 

611
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,230
looking right here for the
normalizations any questions on these

612
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
normalizations any questions on these
 

613
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,630
normalizations any questions on these
kinds of things these are basic

614
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
kinds of things these are basic
 

615
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,270
kinds of things these are basic
ingredients that we had in CNN's we can

616
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
ingredients that we had in CNN's we can
 

617
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,909
ingredients that we had in CNN's we can
just use

618
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919

 

619
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,070

Now

620
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
Now
 

621
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,990
Now
the key question design question that

622
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
the key question design question that
 

623
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,870
the key question design question that
has been recognized recently as a key uh

624
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880
has been recognized recently as a key uh
 

625
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,430
has been recognized recently as a key uh
design question um but not u wasn't as

626
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
design question um but not u wasn't as
 

627
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,710
design question um but not u wasn't as
clearly recognized in the past is where

628
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:38,720
clearly recognized in the past is where
 

629
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,830
clearly recognized in the past is where
do the nonlinearities go?

630
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
do the nonlinearities go?
 

631
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,630
do the nonlinearities go?
Okay, so

632
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
Okay, so
 

633
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,710
Okay, so
we know that to have our neural nets

634
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
we know that to have our neural nets
 

635
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,549
we know that to have our neural nets
have expressive power, we need to have

636
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
have expressive power, we need to have
 

637
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,870
have expressive power, we need to have
nonlinearities in them. Otherwise, you

638
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
nonlinearities in them. Otherwise, you
 

639
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,190
nonlinearities in them. Otherwise, you
can't express very much. So, we're going

640
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
can't express very much. So, we're going
 

641
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,190
can't express very much. So, we're going
to have to put nonlinearities.

642
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
to have to put nonlinearities.
 

643
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,669
to have to put nonlinearities.
And the question is where do they go?

644
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
And the question is where do they go?
 

645
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,870
And the question is where do they go?
So, in some of these blocks like MLPS

646
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
So, in some of these blocks like MLPS
 

647
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,150
So, in some of these blocks like MLPS
and so on, they have their own

648
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,160
and so on, they have their own
 

649
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,830
and so on, they have their own
nonlinearities. That's not a problem.

650
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
nonlinearities. That's not a problem.
 

651
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,270
nonlinearities. That's not a problem.
Those blocks are they're the same as

652
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
Those blocks are they're the same as
 

653
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,990
Those blocks are they're the same as
they were in convent. The question is,

654
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
they were in convent. The question is,
 

655
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,750
they were in convent. The question is,
is there something about the recurrent

656
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
is there something about the recurrent
 

657
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,270
is there something about the recurrent
aspect that you want to have a

658
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
aspect that you want to have a
 

659
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,510
aspect that you want to have a
nonlinearity in?

660
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
nonlinearity in?
 

661
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,029
nonlinearity in?
You can everyone see this is like a

662
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
You can everyone see this is like a
 

663
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,510
You can everyone see this is like a
question a design question that one has

664
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
question a design question that one has
 

665
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,830
question a design question that one has
and

666
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
and
 

667
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,190
and
the traditional RNN perspective is you

668
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
the traditional RNN perspective is you
 

669
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,270
the traditional RNN perspective is you
put a nonlinearity in the state update.

670
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280
put a nonlinearity in the state update.
 

671
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,669
put a nonlinearity in the state update.
So if you start with linear dynamics, so

672
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
So if you start with linear dynamics, so
 

673
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,950
So if you start with linear dynamics, so
I'm going to change them up a little bit

674
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm going to change them up a little bit
 

675
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,909
I'm going to change them up a little bit
to reflect closer to what's in PyTorch.

676
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
to reflect closer to what's in PyTorch.
 

677
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,990
to reflect closer to what's in PyTorch.
So I'm going to drop the D. you were

678
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
So I'm going to drop the D. you were
 

679
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,750
So I'm going to drop the D. you were
saying you know why am I dropping the D

680
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:37,760
saying you know why am I dropping the D
 

681
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,190
saying you know why am I dropping the D
because from the point of view of neural

682
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
because from the point of view of neural
 

683
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,430
because from the point of view of neural
net architecture if I wanted a linear

684
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
net architecture if I wanted a linear
 

685
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,669
net architecture if I wanted a linear
layer going in parallel as a skip I can

686
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
layer going in parallel as a skip I can
 

687
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,150
layer going in parallel as a skip I can
just add it myself so if I think about

688
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
just add it myself so if I think about
 

689
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,830
just add it myself so if I think about
the basic building block I don't this is

690
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
the basic building block I don't this is
 

691
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,909
the basic building block I don't this is
a redundant building block so I'm not

692
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:49,919
a redundant building block so I'm not
 

693
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,750
a redundant building block so I'm not
going to put it in in my core building

694
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
going to put it in in my core building
 

695
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,950
going to put it in in my core building
block um

696
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
block um
 

697
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,110
block um
I in principle I can just do this I can

698
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
I in principle I can just do this I can
 

699
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,270
I in principle I can just do this I can
add biases because we like biases we

700
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
add biases because we like biases we
 

701
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,950
add biases because we like biases we
found them useful in other contexts so

702
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
found them useful in other contexts so
 

703
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,990
found them useful in other contexts so
we'll add them here too learnable biases

704
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
we'll add them here too learnable biases
 

705
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,669
we'll add them here too learnable biases
so we start with linear dynamics ics

706
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:05,679
so we start with linear dynamics ics
 

707
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,110
so we start with linear dynamics ics
like this with some biases

708
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
like this with some biases
 

709
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,750
like this with some biases
and then you add a nonlinearity.

710
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760
and then you add a nonlinearity.
 

711
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,230
and then you add a nonlinearity.
So this is the classic um traditional

712
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:14,240
So this is the classic um traditional
 

713
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,909
So this is the classic um traditional
RNN perspective. So this nonlinearity

714
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
RNN perspective. So this nonlinearity
 

715
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,510
RNN perspective. So this nonlinearity
where is this nonlinearity? It's this

716
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:19,520
where is this nonlinearity? It's this
 

717
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,150
where is this nonlinearity? It's this
thing sigma.

718
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,160
thing sigma.
 

719
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,549
thing sigma.
So what this says is instead of just

720
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
So what this says is instead of just
 

721
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,909
So what this says is instead of just
taking the state and

722
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
taking the state and
 

723
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,669
taking the state and
having it a linear operation happen to

724
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
having it a linear operation happen to
 

725
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,149
having it a linear operation happen to
it after do the linear operation apply

726
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:34,159
it after do the linear operation apply
 

727
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,669
it after do the linear operation apply
nonlinearity component wise.

728
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
nonlinearity component wise.
 

729
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,789
nonlinearity component wise.
So this is playing the same rule um role

730
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
So this is playing the same rule um role
 

731
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,549
So this is playing the same rule um role
that in a classic connet you have a cond

732
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
that in a classic connet you have a cond
 

733
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,070
that in a classic connet you have a cond
a bias and then a relu

734
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
a bias and then a relu
 

735
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,990
a bias and then a relu
right and the relu acts channel by

736
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,000
right and the relu acts channel by
 

737
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,990
right and the relu acts channel by
channel

738
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
channel
 

739
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,669
channel
so this is like that

740
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
so this is like that
 

741
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,350
so this is like that
any questions on sort of the mechanics

742
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
any questions on sort of the mechanics
 

743
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,710
any questions on sort of the mechanics
of it

744
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720

 

745
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,230

now the next thing uh Again you realize

746
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
now the next thing uh Again you realize
 

747
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,149
now the next thing uh Again you realize
is that just as was brought up before

748
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
is that just as was brought up before
 

749
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,310
is that just as was brought up before
that you don't need the D. You can also

750
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320
that you don't need the D. You can also
 

751
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,549
that you don't need the D. You can also
think about this entire Y part as being

752
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
think about this entire Y part as being
 

753
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,950
think about this entire Y part as being
a linear layer.

754
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
a linear layer.
 

755
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,070
a linear layer.
So the core representation of an RNN

756
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,080
So the core representation of an RNN
 

757
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,870
So the core representation of an RNN
layer building block in PyTorch doesn't

758
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:24,880
layer building block in PyTorch doesn't
 

759
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,149
layer building block in PyTorch doesn't
have this part. It just says we need an

760
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
have this part. It just says we need an
 

761
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,230
have this part. It just says we need an
output. What's your output? Your output

762
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
output. What's your output? Your output
 

763
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,909
output. What's your output? Your output
is just the state. Just send out H. If

764
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:33,919
is just the state. Just send out H. If
 

765
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,190
is just the state. Just send out H. If
you want to do processing on it, go

766
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200
you want to do processing on it, go
 

767
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,230
you want to do processing on it, go
ahead and add a linear layer explicitly.

768
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,240

 

769
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,750

Okay,

770
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
Okay,
 

771
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,510
Okay,
so

772
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520

 

773
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,070

we'll just call these vanilla RNNs. Like

774
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,080
we'll just call these vanilla RNNs. Like
 

775
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,669
we'll just call these vanilla RNNs. Like
it's a classic basic RNN structure.

776
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,679
it's a classic basic RNN structure.
 

777
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,990
it's a classic basic RNN structure.
Any questions on what this is? Yeah,

778
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
Any questions on what this is? Yeah,
 

779
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,350
Any questions on what this is? Yeah,

786
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
follow I'm following pietorch notation
 

787
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,110
follow I'm following pietorch notation
here a little bit on that one. So let me

788
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,120
here a little bit on that one. So let me
 

789
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,510
here a little bit on that one. So let me
make it very clear of what I'm written

790
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520
make it very clear of what I'm written
 

791
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,789
make it very clear of what I'm written
here. This is w subscript h. So in

792
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
here. This is w subscript h. So in
 

793
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,669
here. This is w subscript h. So in
pietorch this is sometimes called whh.

794
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,679
pietorch this is sometimes called whh.
 

795
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,390
pietorch this is sometimes called whh.
It's the mapping from h to h. There's a

796
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
It's the mapping from h to h. There's a
 

797
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,789
It's the mapping from h to h. There's a
this b I'm using b because that's the

798
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:22,799
this b I'm using b because that's the
 

799
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,870
this b I'm using b because that's the
normal systems theory way of writing it.

800
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
normal systems theory way of writing it.
 

801
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,990
normal systems theory way of writing it.
But the b in pietorch is w um uh or hu

802
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
But the b in pietorch is w um uh or hu
 

803
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,350
But the b in pietorch is w um uh or hu
there's like a weight associated with it

804
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
there's like a weight associated with it
 

805
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,390
there's like a weight associated with it
that's learnable.

806
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
that's learnable.
 

807
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,270
that's learnable.
>> So just to be clear like WB and C will

808
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,280
>> So just to be clear like WB and C will
 

809
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,590
>> So just to be clear like WB and C will
all be different for each layer, right?

810
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:39,600
all be different for each layer, right?
 

811
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,470
all be different for each layer, right?
>> Yes.

812
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
>> Yes.
 

813
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,110
>> Yes.
>> Uh for for the layers they're different.

814
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
>> Uh for for the layers they're different.
 

815
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,830
>> Uh for for the layers they're different.
They're always So just like in CNN's in

816
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
They're always So just like in CNN's in
 

817
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,830
They're always So just like in CNN's in
connets, we don't reuse the same con

818
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:47,840
connets, we don't reuse the same con
 

819
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,750
connets, we don't reuse the same con
from one layer to the next. We use

820
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:49,760
from one layer to the next. We use
 

821
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,870
from one layer to the next. We use
different cons just like that in RNN's

822
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
different cons just like that in RNN's
 

823
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,750
different cons just like that in RNN's
we use different W's, different filters

824
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:55,760
we use different W's, different filters
 

825
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,990
we use different W's, different filters
for different layers. The weight sharing

826
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,000
for different layers. The weight sharing
 

827
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,029
for different layers. The weight sharing
is across time, not across layers. Just

828
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
is across time, not across layers. Just
 

829
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,270
is across time, not across layers. Just
like CNN weight sharing is across space

830
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
like CNN weight sharing is across space
 

831
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,870
like CNN weight sharing is across space
not across layers.

832
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:06,880
not across layers.
 

833
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,549
not across layers.
The community where weight sharing

834
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:08,559
The community where weight sharing
 

835
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,590
The community where weight sharing
across layers is done more is in the GNN

836
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,600
across layers is done more is in the GNN
 

837
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,149
across layers is done more is in the GNN
community. Often there they will play

838
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
community. Often there they will play
 

839
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,430
community. Often there they will play
around with doing more weight sharing

840
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,440
around with doing more weight sharing
 

841
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,230
around with doing more weight sharing
across layers.

842
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
across layers.
 

843
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,990
across layers.
Good questions.

844
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,000
Good questions.
 

845
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,870
Good questions.
Okay. So this is the basic story. Now

846
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
Okay. So this is the basic story. Now
 

847
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,470
Okay. So this is the basic story. Now
a comment here is important that

848
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
a comment here is important that
 

849
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,710
a comment here is important that
let me write this in

850
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:34,720

 

851
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,830

nonlinearity.

852
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840

 

853
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,870

So in CNN's relu's and relu like things

854
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:44,880
So in CNN's relu's and relu like things
 

855
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,630
So in CNN's relu's and relu like things
took over

856
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:46,640
took over
 

857
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,990
took over
okay as the functions to use. In RNN,

858
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
okay as the functions to use. In RNN,
 

859
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,310
okay as the functions to use. In RNN,
classical RNN, the nonlinearities are

860
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
classical RNN, the nonlinearities are
 

861
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,149
classical RNN, the nonlinearities are
typically

862
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159

 

863
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,149

like sigmoid,

864
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:00,159

 

865
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,310

tanh,

866
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320

 

867
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,870

that kind of stuff is typically what's

868
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:06,880
that kind of stuff is typically what's
 

869
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,470
that kind of stuff is typically what's
used

870
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
used
 

871
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,789
used
in RNS.

872
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799

 

873
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,630

So why is that? For that we will just um

874
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,640
So why is that? For that we will just um
 

875
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,990
So why is that? For that we will just um
think about back prop. So everyone

876
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
think about back prop. So everyone
 

877
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,310
think about back prop. So everyone
understand the story with the the basic

878
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
understand the story with the the basic
 

879
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,750
understand the story with the the basic
what is that RNN layer look like?

880
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:25,760
what is that RNN layer look like?
 

881
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,750
what is that RNN layer look like?
It's just doing this

882
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
It's just doing this
 

883
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,510
It's just doing this
update recursive update with a

884
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
update recursive update with a
 

885
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,510
update recursive update with a
nonlinearity as the counterpart of a

886
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
nonlinearity as the counterpart of a
 

887
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,630
nonlinearity as the counterpart of a
conf.

888
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:36,640

 

889
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,630

So now how do you do back prop during

890
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640
So now how do you do back prop during
 

891
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,110
So now how do you do back prop during
training? How does this work?

892
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
training? How does this work?
 

893
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,269
training? How does this work?
Again as always the easy answer is that

894
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:45,279
Again as always the easy answer is that
 

895
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,110
Again as always the easy answer is that
PyTorch takes care of it for you. So

896
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,120
PyTorch takes care of it for you. So
 

897
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,190
PyTorch takes care of it for you. So
don't worry about it, right? Um but

898
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,200
don't worry about it, right? Um but
 

899
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,470
don't worry about it, right? Um but
let's just like make sure we understand

900
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:50,480
let's just like make sure we understand
 

901
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,510
let's just like make sure we understand
it.

902
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,520

 

903
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,390

So here we've drawn the network

904
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:56,400
So here we've drawn the network
 

905
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,430
So here we've drawn the network
as we've drawn it and

906
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
as we've drawn it and
 

907
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,710
as we've drawn it and
for training you have to have a loss.

908
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:02,720
for training you have to have a loss.
 

909
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,190
for training you have to have a loss.
So there's a couple of different cases

910
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,200
So there's a couple of different cases
 

911
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,510
So there's a couple of different cases
that can happen. One is where you

912
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:07,520
that can happen. One is where you
 

913
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,350
that can happen. One is where you
actually expect to make some kind of

914
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360
actually expect to make some kind of
 

915
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,190
actually expect to make some kind of
prediction at every time step.

916
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,200
prediction at every time step.
 

917
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,630
prediction at every time step.
There's problems like this in which this

918
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
There's problems like this in which this
 

919
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,149
There's problems like this in which this
is a reasonable thing to do in which

920
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:16,159
is a reasonable thing to do in which
 

921
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,549
is a reasonable thing to do in which
case we have a loss layer up on top

922
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:18,559
case we have a loss layer up on top
 

923
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,789
case we have a loss layer up on top
which has supervision for every single

924
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
which has supervision for every single
 

925
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,950
which has supervision for every single
time step of what you want.

926
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
time step of what you want.
 

927
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,510
time step of what you want.
There's other problems in which you just

928
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,520
There's other problems in which you just
 

929
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,549
There's other problems in which you just
want an answer at the very end.

930
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
want an answer at the very end.
 

931
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,669
want an answer at the very end.
Okay. And in there you know these are

932
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:33,679
Okay. And in there you know these are
 

933
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,430
Okay. And in there you know these are
not doing anything and there's one at

934
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
not doing anything and there's one at
 

935
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,110
not doing anything and there's one at
the very end that is doing all of the

936
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,120
the very end that is doing all of the
 

937
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,190
the very end that is doing all of the
actual supervision work.

938
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:41,200

 

939
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,110

Everyone good?

940
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
Everyone good?
 

941
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,029
Everyone good?
Okay. So

942
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:47,039
Okay. So
 

943
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,510
Okay. So
what happens with backrop?

944
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520

 

945
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,669

So when you do back prop uh in this

946
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
So when you do back prop uh in this
 

947
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,630
So when you do back prop uh in this
setup

948
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
setup
 

949
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,269
setup
the of course the gradients are going to

950
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
the of course the gradients are going to
 

951
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,230
the of course the gradients are going to
go back this way

952
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:02,240
go back this way
 

953
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,750
go back this way
and just as in a CNN the gradients are

954
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:05,760
and just as in a CNN the gradients are
 

955
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,990
and just as in a CNN the gradients are
going to keep flowing back

956
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,000

 

957
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,029

this way all the way down through the

958
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:15,039
this way all the way down through the
 

959
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,669
this way all the way down through the
layers. Everyone good with that? Okay.

960
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:17,679
layers. Everyone good with that? Okay.
 

961
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,870
layers. Everyone good with that? Okay.
If you have residual connections,

962
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:18,880
If you have residual connections,
 

963
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,830
If you have residual connections,
there's going to be a gradient

964
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
there's going to be a gradient
 

965
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,710
there's going to be a gradient
superighway that'll carry the gradients

966
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
superighway that'll carry the gradients
 

967
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,950
superighway that'll carry the gradients
back in this direction very nicely.

968
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
back in this direction very nicely.
 

969
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,149
back in this direction very nicely.
Everything is as before.

970
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:28,159
Everything is as before.
 

971
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,110
Everything is as before.
But in a connet, remember, you also had

972
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,120
But in a connet, remember, you also had
 

973
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:39,269
But in a connet, remember, you also had
gradients going across the convex.

974
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:39,279

 

975
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,950

Okay, here the role of the conf is

976
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:42,960
Okay, here the role of the conf is
 

977
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,070
Okay, here the role of the conf is
played by the RNN the RNN layer and what

978
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,080
played by the RNN the RNN layer and what
 

979
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,669
played by the RNN the RNN layer and what
that RNN layer is going to do is it

980
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
that RNN layer is going to do is it
 

981
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,269
that RNN layer is going to do is it
means a gradient is going to go back

982
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:51,279
means a gradient is going to go back
 

983
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,909
means a gradient is going to go back
across this way.

984
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:55,919

 

985
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,430

Now this is happening for all of these

986
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
Now this is happening for all of these
 

987
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,630
Now this is happening for all of these
losses and as was commented before you

988
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,640
losses and as was commented before you
 

989
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,310
losses and as was commented before you
know superposition applies.

990
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
know superposition applies.
 

991
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,190
know superposition applies.
So all these gradients are

992
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
So all these gradients are
 

993
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,269
So all these gradients are
superposed with each other.

994
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
superposed with each other.
 

995
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:21,750
superposed with each other.
as they go through.

996
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:21,760

 

997
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,669

So all these gradients are moving in the

998
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:23,679
So all these gradients are moving in the
 

999
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,909
So all these gradients are moving in the
system because that's the way the

1000
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
system because that's the way the
 

1001
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,630
system because that's the way the
dependence is. Now here there's

1002
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:28,640
dependence is. Now here there's
 

1003
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,149
dependence is. Now here there's
something that's you might think is a

1004
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:30,159
something that's you might think is a
 

1005
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,350
something that's you might think is a
little bit interesting which is that

1006
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,360
little bit interesting which is that
 

1007
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,950
little bit interesting which is that
in a convey

1008
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:36,960

 

1009
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,110

layers to have the receptive field grow.

1010
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,120
layers to have the receptive field grow.
 

1011
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,830
layers to have the receptive field grow.
Everyone remember that? But here you

1012
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840
Everyone remember that? But here you
 

1013
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,310
Everyone remember that? But here you
have an infinite impulse response which

1014
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,320
have an infinite impulse response which
 

1015
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,750
have an infinite impulse response which
means that everything in the past

1016
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:47,760
means that everything in the past
 

1017
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,029
means that everything in the past
actually influences what you're doing

1018
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
actually influences what you're doing
 

1019
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,390
actually influences what you're doing
here. And so the receptive field for

1020
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:52,400
here. And so the receptive field for
 

1021
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,070
here. And so the receptive field for
everything is just everything in the

1022
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
everything is just everything in the
 

1023
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,389
everything is just everything in the
past not the future because it's causal.

1024
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
past not the future because it's causal.
 

1025
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,149
past not the future because it's causal.
was everything in the past. So the

1026
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
was everything in the past. So the
 

1027
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,510
was everything in the past. So the
gradients on each of these layers is go

1028
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,520
gradients on each of these layers is go
 

1029
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,310
gradients on each of these layers is go
are going back all the way.

1030
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:06,320

 

1031
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,190

Everyone sees this.

1032
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,200
Everyone sees this.
 

1033
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,350
Everyone sees this.
Okay. So

1034
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,360

 

1035
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,789

what that means is that if you if you do

1036
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:18,799
what that means is that if you if you do
 

1037
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,750
what that means is that if you if you do
this uh

1038
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:21,760
this uh
 

1039
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,310
this uh
you have to be a little concerned about

1040
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,320
you have to be a little concerned about
 

1041
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,430
you have to be a little concerned about
how gradients are propagating over long

1042
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,440
how gradients are propagating over long
 

1043
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,789
how gradients are propagating over long
periods of time. So the difference is

1044
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:30,799
periods of time. So the difference is
 

1045
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,110
periods of time. So the difference is
that you get to control the number of

1046
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,120
that you get to control the number of
 

1047
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,909
that you get to control the number of
layers you use in your network. You can

1048
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:35,919
layers you use in your network. You can
 

1049
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,830
layers you use in your network. You can
make it five, you can make it 10, you

1050
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,840
make it five, you can make it 10, you
 

1051
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,310
make it five, you can make it 10, you
can make it 50, you can make it 200,

1052
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
can make it 50, you can make it 200,
 

1053
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,190
can make it 50, you can make it 200,
whatever. You're free from that point of

1054
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,200
whatever. You're free from that point of
 

1055
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,230
whatever. You're free from that point of
view to add these residual connections

1056
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
view to add these residual connections
 

1057
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,710
view to add these residual connections
um for whatever expressive forever your

1058
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720
um for whatever expressive forever your
 

1059
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,750
um for whatever expressive forever your
gradient superighway in the vertical

1060
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:51,760
gradient superighway in the vertical
 

1061
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,950
gradient superighway in the vertical
direction. That's all fine.

1062
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
direction. That's all fine.
 

1063
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,990
direction. That's all fine.
Now, in the horizontal direction, the

1064
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
Now, in the horizontal direction, the
 

1065
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,149
Now, in the horizontal direction, the
length of your input depends on what

1066
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:00,159
length of your input depends on what
 

1067
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,230
length of your input depends on what
your data is actually like.

1068
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,240

 

1069
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,029

And in language type problems oftentimes

1070
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
And in language type problems oftentimes
 

1071
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,230
And in language type problems oftentimes
you have uh text which is quite long

1072
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,240
you have uh text which is quite long
 

1073
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,870
you have uh text which is quite long
right so it might be 100 200 300 500

1074
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
right so it might be 100 200 300 500
 

1075
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,230
right so it might be 100 200 300 500
uh you know inputs long or even longer

1076
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,240
uh you know inputs long or even longer
 

1077
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,070
uh you know inputs long or even longer
and so there is a question of whether

1078
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,080
and so there is a question of whether
 

1079
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,070
and so there is a question of whether
the gradients how gradients behave when

1080
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
the gradients how gradients behave when
 

1081
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,950
the gradients how gradients behave when
they're flowing backward.

1082
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:28,960
they're flowing backward.
 

1083
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,950
they're flowing backward.
Everyone sees this. Now

1084
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
Everyone sees this. Now
 

1085
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,310
Everyone sees this. Now
the challenge is that if you just

1086
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320
the challenge is that if you just
 

1087
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,350
the challenge is that if you just
naively added a residual connection to

1088
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,360
naively added a residual connection to
 

1089
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,590
naively added a residual connection to
create a gradient superighway going in

1090
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:41,600
create a gradient superighway going in
 

1091
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,310
create a gradient superighway going in
the uh in this axis in the in the

1092
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,320
the uh in this axis in the in the
 

1093
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,350
the uh in this axis in the in the
horizontal axis you would shape and

1094
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:47,360
horizontal axis you would shape and
 

1095
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,350
horizontal axis you would shape and
change the inductive bias of this

1096
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:49,360
change the inductive bias of this
 

1097
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,269
change the inductive bias of this
network quite substantially. you change

1098
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:51,279
network quite substantially. you change
 

1099
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,149
network quite substantially. you change
what it expresses

1100
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
what it expresses
 

1101
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,789
what it expresses
because suddenly you have you're adding

1102
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:56,799
because suddenly you have you're adding
 

1103
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,870
because suddenly you have you're adding
something into this uh recursion here

1104
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:00,880
something into this uh recursion here
 

1105
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,269
something into this uh recursion here
that's basically like some identity type

1106
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:03,279
that's basically like some identity type
 

1107
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,230
that's basically like some identity type
thing into this W. So what happens if

1108
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,240
thing into this W. So what happens if
 

1109
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,029
thing into this W. So what happens if
you add an identity to a general set of

1110
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,039
you add an identity to a general set of
 

1111
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,350
you add an identity to a general set of
weights W? You're probably going to move

1112
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
weights W? You're probably going to move
 

1113
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,950
weights W? You're probably going to move
the igen values out to be bigger outside

1114
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
the igen values out to be bigger outside
 

1115
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,669
the igen values out to be bigger outside
the unit circle.

1116
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
the unit circle.
 

1117
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,990
the unit circle.
Which means now you're worried that if

1118
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
Which means now you're worried that if
 

1119
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,710
Which means now you're worried that if
you do this over and over again, you

1120
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
you do this over and over again, you
 

1121
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,590
you do this over and over again, you
might blow up,

1122
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
might blow up,
 

1123
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,350
might blow up,
right? In straight activations will blow

1124
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,360
right? In straight activations will blow
 

1125
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,630
right? In straight activations will blow
up. Everyone see that? So how do you

1126
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:30,640
up. Everyone see that? So how do you
 

1127
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,269
up. Everyone see that? So how do you
combat that? One of the ways you combat

1128
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:33,279
combat that? One of the ways you combat
 

1129
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,549
combat that? One of the ways you combat
that or just to combat that fear

1130
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:34,559
that or just to combat that fear
 

1131
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,149
that or just to combat that fear
generally is by having these

1132
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:36,159
generally is by having these
 

1133
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,870
generally is by having these
nonlinearities like sigmoid or tanh

1134
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
nonlinearities like sigmoid or tanh
 

1135
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,070
nonlinearities like sigmoid or tanh
which saturate. So sigmoid and tanh

1136
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,080
which saturate. So sigmoid and tanh
 

1137
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,710
which saturate. So sigmoid and tanh
refuse to get big. And so this is one of

1138
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:44,720
refuse to get big. And so this is one of
 

1139
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,350
refuse to get big. And so this is one of
the reasons why people would uh even

1140
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,360
the reasons why people would uh even
 

1141
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,549
the reasons why people would uh even
without putting a residual connection in

1142
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:48,559
without putting a residual connection in
 

1143
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,149
without putting a residual connection in
the horizontal direction would use

1144
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:50,159
the horizontal direction would use
 

1145
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,070
the horizontal direction would use
nonlinearities that are sigmoid or tanh

1146
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,080
nonlinearities that are sigmoid or tanh
 

1147
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,430
nonlinearities that are sigmoid or tanh
to help with making sure that things

1148
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,440
to help with making sure that things
 

1149
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,310
to help with making sure that things
don't blow up. whereas relu you're

1150
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
don't blow up. whereas relu you're
 

1151
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,669
don't blow up. whereas relu you're
worried they might blow up

1152
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
worried they might blow up
 

1153
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,110
worried they might blow up
because this is a bit of you know

1154
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,120
because this is a bit of you know
 

1155
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,830
because this is a bit of you know
historical perspective here. Okay, so

1156
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
historical perspective here. Okay, so
 

1157
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,430
historical perspective here. Okay, so
this is what's going on with the sort of

1158
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
this is what's going on with the sort of
 

1159
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,510
this is what's going on with the sort of
backdrop in um RNN's.

1160
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:13,520
backdrop in um RNN's.
 

1161
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,830
backdrop in um RNN's.
Now what happened historically right is

1162
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:17,840
Now what happened historically right is
 

1163
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,830
Now what happened historically right is
that when you set up these traditional

1164
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:19,840
that when you set up these traditional
 

1165
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,549
that when you set up these traditional
RNNs for sequential problems especially

1166
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:22,559
RNNs for sequential problems especially
 

1167
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,909
RNNs for sequential problems especially
problems in language they sort of worked

1168
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:25,919
problems in language they sort of worked
 

1169
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,630
problems in language they sort of worked
but they didn't work very well.

1170
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:28,640
but they didn't work very well.
 

1171
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,870
but they didn't work very well.
Okay,

1172
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:30,880
Okay,
 

1173
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,909
Okay,
they just, you know,

1174
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
they just, you know,
 

1175
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,430
they just, you know,
so

1176
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
so
 

1177
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,230
so
what happened was there was a lot of of

1178
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,240
what happened was there was a lot of of
 

1179
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,070
what happened was there was a lot of of
work on this and we're not going to be

1180
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,080
work on this and we're not going to be
 

1181
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,630
work on this and we're not going to be
talking about that work, okay? Because

1182
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:44,640
talking about that work, okay? Because
 

1183
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,110
talking about that work, okay? Because
uh

1184
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,120
uh
 

1185
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,310
uh
so for example there is this idea that

1186
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,320
so for example there is this idea that
 

1187
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,430
so for example there is this idea that
was extremely important historically was

1188
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,440
was extremely important historically was
 

1189
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,310
was extremely important historically was
the idea of what are called LSTMs

1190
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,320
the idea of what are called LSTMs
 

1191
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,710
the idea of what are called LSTMs
which are uh stands for long shortterm

1192
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:00,720
which are uh stands for long shortterm
 

1193
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,909
which are uh stands for long shortterm
memory. Okay, where the idea was

1194
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
memory. Okay, where the idea was
 

1195
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,430
memory. Okay, where the idea was
if you had these long flows of

1196
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:09,440
if you had these long flows of
 

1197
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,230
if you had these long flows of
information in your network, people said

1198
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:12,240
information in your network, people said
 

1199
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,669
information in your network, people said
it wasn't training and it wasn't

1200
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:13,679
it wasn't training and it wasn't
 

1201
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,509
it wasn't training and it wasn't
learning what what they thought was as

1202
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:15,519
learning what what they thought was as
 

1203
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,750
learning what what they thought was as
long range dependencies. So, it would

1204
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:17,760
long range dependencies. So, it would
 

1205
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,350
long range dependencies. So, it would
learn very local things, but it wouldn't

1206
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:19,360
learn very local things, but it wouldn't
 

1207
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,269
learn very local things, but it wouldn't
learn things very far away. And the

1208
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:21,279
learn things very far away. And the
 

1209
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,190
learn things very far away. And the
reason was that if you look at the

1210
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,200
reason was that if you look at the
 

1211
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,750
reason was that if you look at the
gradient flow going back here, you

1212
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
gradient flow going back here, you
 

1213
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,310
gradient flow going back here, you
forced it to be stable, right? It has to

1214
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,320
forced it to be stable, right? It has to
 

1215
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,230
forced it to be stable, right? It has to
be stable for it to work. Which means

1216
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,240
be stable for it to work. Which means
 

1217
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,669
be stable for it to work. Which means
that in linear type things stable means

1218
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:33,679
that in linear type things stable means
 

1219
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,870
that in linear type things stable means
dying exponential.

1220
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:36,880
dying exponential.
 

1221
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,509
dying exponential.
So by the time you got to something far

1222
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:39,519
So by the time you got to something far
 

1223
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,990
So by the time you got to something far
in the b past the gradient from in

1224
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,000
in the b past the gradient from in
 

1225
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,350
in the b past the gradient from in
whatever happening in that loss over

1226
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,360
whatever happening in that loss over
 

1227
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,230
whatever happening in that loss over
there was very very small and so it just

1228
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:46,240
there was very very small and so it just
 

1229
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,430
there was very very small and so it just
didn't change. It never learned these

1230
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:47,440
didn't change. It never learned these
 

1231
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,509
didn't change. It never learned these
long range dependencies.

1232
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:49,519
long range dependencies.
 

1233
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,269
long range dependencies.
This is the classical problem that

1234
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:51,279
This is the classical problem that
 

1235
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,190
This is the classical problem that
people saw in uh in RNNs and so they

1236
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,200
people saw in uh in RNNs and so they
 

1237
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,950
people saw in uh in RNNs and so they
tried to come up with solutions. So like

1238
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:56,960
tried to come up with solutions. So like
 

1239
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,470
tried to come up with solutions. So like
I said, you just can't naively add a

1240
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:58,480
I said, you just can't naively add a
 

1241
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,830
I said, you just can't naively add a
residual connection because it won't

1242
00:32:59,830 --> 00:32:59,840
residual connection because it won't
 

1243
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,669
residual connection because it won't
work. So they wanted to add something

1244
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:01,679
work. So they wanted to add something
 

1245
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,430
work. So they wanted to add something
that was like a residual connection, but

1246
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
that was like a residual connection, but
 

1247
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,110
that was like a residual connection, but
in that it would try to carry gradients

1248
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,120
in that it would try to carry gradients
 

1249
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,750
in that it would try to carry gradients
back further, but it was very very

1250
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:09,760
back further, but it was very very
 

1251
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,070
back further, but it was very very
delicate. And so just an example, if you

1252
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,080
delicate. And so just an example, if you
 

1253
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,669
delicate. And so just an example, if you
want to, you can look at the code in

1254
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:13,679
want to, you can look at the code in
 

1255
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,190
want to, you can look at the code in
PyTorch uh for LSTMs.

1256
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,200
PyTorch uh for LSTMs.
 

1257
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,630
PyTorch uh for LSTMs.
And an one way of telling that something

1258
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640
And an one way of telling that something
 

1259
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,590
And an one way of telling that something
is super delicate is when the LSTM paper

1260
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:25,600
is super delicate is when the LSTM paper
 

1261
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,350
is super delicate is when the LSTM paper
disagrees with the LSTM code.

1262
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
disagrees with the LSTM code.
 

1263
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,310
disagrees with the LSTM code.
Okay, so the paper has a description of

1264
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,320
Okay, so the paper has a description of
 

1265
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,990
Okay, so the paper has a description of
certain design choices and things one

1266
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,000
certain design choices and things one
 

1267
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,070
certain design choices and things one
would do and the code is subtly

1268
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,080
would do and the code is subtly
 

1269
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,909
would do and the code is subtly
different.

1270
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:37,919
different.
 

1271
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,549
different.
So that's like an indication that okay,

1272
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
So that's like an indication that okay,
 

1273
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,830
So that's like an indication that okay,
people were working on the code, right?

1274
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:41,840
people were working on the code, right?
 

1275
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,669
people were working on the code, right?
The code had to work, right? Right? And

1276
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:43,679
The code had to work, right? Right? And
 

1277
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,070
The code had to work, right? Right? And
they fiddled with it until it worked.

1278
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,080
they fiddled with it until it worked.
 

1279
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,909
they fiddled with it until it worked.
And there was no good explanation for

1280
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:49,919
And there was no good explanation for
 

1281
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,230
And there was no good explanation for
why you had to change some things, drop

1282
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
why you had to change some things, drop
 

1283
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,750
why you had to change some things, drop
certain things that were completely

1284
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:53,760
certain things that were completely
 

1285
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,350
certain things that were completely
reasonable from a thinking point of view

1286
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,360
reasonable from a thinking point of view
 

1287
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,630
reasonable from a thinking point of view
and are in the paper, but don't work.

1288
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:58,640
and are in the paper, but don't work.
 

1289
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,430
and are in the paper, but don't work.
Okay, so there's a lot of study on how

1290
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,440
Okay, so there's a lot of study on how
 

1291
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,909
Okay, so there's a lot of study on how
to trying to understand LSTMs, but LSTMs

1292
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:03,919
to trying to understand LSTMs, but LSTMs
 

1293
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,269
to trying to understand LSTMs, but LSTMs
really were a very important historical

1294
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:05,279
really were a very important historical
 

1295
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,190
really were a very important historical
breakthrough that they finally allowed

1296
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,200
breakthrough that they finally allowed
 

1297
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,270
breakthrough that they finally allowed
you to have these networks perform

1298
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:09,280
you to have these networks perform
 

1299
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,990
you to have these networks perform
reasonably on long range tasks. and some

1300
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
reasonably on long range tasks. and some
 

1301
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,990
reasonably on long range tasks. and some
of the idea and there's a simplification

1302
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,000
of the idea and there's a simplification
 

1303
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,869
of the idea and there's a simplification
of LSTMs called GRUs

1304
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:16,879
of LSTMs called GRUs
 

1305
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,510
of LSTMs called GRUs
gated recurrent units that also seem to

1306
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,520
gated recurrent units that also seem to
 

1307
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,190
gated recurrent units that also seem to
work and there's a lot of work trying to

1308
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,200
work and there's a lot of work trying to
 

1309
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,470
work and there's a lot of work trying to
understand what's going on what's

1310
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:22,480
understand what's going on what's
 

1311
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,790
understand what's going on what's
happening and some of the ideas in this

1312
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
happening and some of the ideas in this
 

1313
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,190
happening and some of the ideas in this
LSTM GRU um context are actually present

1314
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,200
LSTM GRU um context are actually present
 

1315
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,869
LSTM GRU um context are actually present
today but we can talk about them in a

1316
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:32,879
today but we can talk about them in a
 

1317
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,230
today but we can talk about them in a
way today that doesn't have to go

1318
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,240
way today that doesn't have to go
 

1319
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,790
way today that doesn't have to go
through this um way of thinking but you

1320
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:36,800
through this um way of thinking but you
 

1321
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,230
through this um way of thinking but you
should be aware of it so a traditional

1322
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,240
should be aware of it so a traditional
 

1323
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,389
should be aware of it so a traditional
lecture on RN RNNs would spend a lot of

1324
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,399
lecture on RN RNNs would spend a lot of
 

1325
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,790
lecture on RN RNNs would spend a lot of
time at this point talking about okay

1326
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:44,800
time at this point talking about okay
 

1327
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,710
time at this point talking about okay
what's wrong with basic RNN's how do we

1328
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:48,720
what's wrong with basic RNN's how do we
 

1329
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,869
what's wrong with basic RNN's how do we
fix it here are strategies here's things

1330
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:50,879
fix it here are strategies here's things
 

1331
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,550
fix it here are strategies here's things
you would do okay however we are not

1332
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:54,560
you would do okay however we are not
 

1333
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,389
you would do okay however we are not
going to be giving you those lectures if

1334
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:56,399
going to be giving you those lectures if
 

1335
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,310
going to be giving you those lectures if
you want you can read the deep learning

1336
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
you want you can read the deep learning
 

1337
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,950
you want you can read the deep learning
um book that we pointed to that has a

1338
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:00,960
um book that we pointed to that has a
 

1339
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,390
um book that we pointed to that has a
treatment of some of this and there's a

1340
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,400
treatment of some of this and there's a
 

1341
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,670
treatment of some of this and there's a
lot more out there you can find

1342
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:05,680
lot more out there you can find
 

1343
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,710
lot more out there you can find
we're going to take a different

1344
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:06,720
we're going to take a different
 

1345
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,950
we're going to take a different
perspective

1346
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:08,960
perspective
 

1347
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,109
perspective
we're going to take a modern perspective

1348
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,119
we're going to take a modern perspective
 

1349
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,710
we're going to take a modern perspective
that says is there something wrong with

1350
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:14,720
that says is there something wrong with
 

1351
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,270
that says is there something wrong with
this choice this design choice of

1352
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,280
this choice this design choice of
 

1353
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,069
this choice this design choice of
where one puts the nonlinearity

1354
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:22,079
where one puts the nonlinearity
 

1355
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,710
where one puts the nonlinearity
in the horizontal direction.

1356
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
in the horizontal direction.
 

1357
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,310
in the horizontal direction.
Okay.

1358
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
Okay.
 

1359
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,910
Okay.
So

1360
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
So
 

1361
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,470
So
to understand that

1362
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,480
to understand that
 

1363
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,670
to understand that
the way to think about it is in terms of

1364
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:33,680
the way to think about it is in terms of
 

1365
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,349
the way to think about it is in terms of
parallelism

1366
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:35,359
parallelism
 

1367
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,349
parallelism
during training. So what do I mean? So

1368
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
during training. So what do I mean? So
 

1369
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,950
during training. So what do I mean? So
back prop during training works like

1370
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
back prop during training works like
 

1371
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,470
back prop during training works like
this

1372
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:42,480
this
 

1373
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,950
this
and let's think about the computation

1374
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
and let's think about the computation
 

1375
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,550
and let's think about the computation
you have to do during training and ask

1376
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:48,560
you have to do during training and ask
 

1377
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,910
you have to do during training and ask
yourself the question of what's the

1378
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:49,920
yourself the question of what's the
 

1379
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,470
yourself the question of what's the
dependency graph you understand the idea

1380
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:52,480
dependency graph you understand the idea
 

1381
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,230
dependency graph you understand the idea
of a dependency graph like what what has

1382
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
of a dependency graph like what what has
 

1383
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,750
of a dependency graph like what what has
to be done before something else

1384
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:55,760
to be done before something else
 

1385
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,390
to be done before something else
happens.

1386
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:58,400
happens.
 

1387
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,430
happens.
So when you get the first so in training

1388
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,440
So when you get the first so in training
 

1389
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,230
So when you get the first so in training
you have the entire input all at once.

1390
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,240
you have the entire input all at once.
 

1391
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,670
you have the entire input all at once.
At inference time it might be coming to

1392
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:05,680
At inference time it might be coming to
 

1393
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,870
At inference time it might be coming to
you sequentially but at training you

1394
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:06,880
you sequentially but at training you
 

1395
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,950
you sequentially but at training you
have the entire sequence.

1396
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:08,960
have the entire sequence.
 

1397
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,470
have the entire sequence.
Does everyone see that you're training

1398
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,480
Does everyone see that you're training
 

1399
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,230
Does everyone see that you're training
you have the data. So you have all of

1400
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:12,240
you have the data. So you have all of
 

1401
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,150
you have the data. So you have all of
this at once.

1402
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,160

 

1403
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,589

Okay. Can you execute this box? Yes, you

1404
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:19,599
Okay. Can you execute this box? Yes, you
 

1405
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,750
Okay. Can you execute this box? Yes, you
can execute this box because everything

1406
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760
can execute this box because everything
 

1407
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,870
can execute this box because everything
is causal. This box runs.

1408
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:24,880
is causal. This box runs.
 

1409
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,310
is causal. This box runs.
Okay. Once you have this box, which box

1410
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,320
Okay. Once you have this box, which box
 

1411
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,230
Okay. Once you have this box, which box
is unlock

1412
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,240
is unlock
 

1413
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,670
is unlock
to execute? This one and this one.

1414
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:33,680
to execute? This one and this one.
 

1415
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,910
to execute? This one and this one.
Importantly, you can't execute this box

1416
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:37,920
Importantly, you can't execute this box
 

1417
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,030
Importantly, you can't execute this box
without this box being done.

1418
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,040
without this box being done.
 

1419
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,109
without this box being done.
So what we're going to do is we're just

1420
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:45,119
So what we're going to do is we're just
 

1421
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,230
So what we're going to do is we're just
going to take this diagram and we're

1422
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
going to take this diagram and we're
 

1423
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,950
going to take this diagram and we're
going to draw it with the like

1424
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:50,960
going to draw it with the like
 

1425
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,589
going to draw it with the like
dependency graph of what depends on what

1426
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:53,599
dependency graph of what depends on what
 

1427
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,390
dependency graph of what depends on what
for execution more clear. So that just

1428
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:56,400
for execution more clear. So that just
 

1429
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,550
for execution more clear. So that just
means we turn it around.

1430
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:58,560
means we turn it around.
 

1431
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,670
means we turn it around.
Okay.

1432
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680

 

1433
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,630

So now everything above is unlocked when

1434
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:06,640
So now everything above is unlocked when
 

1435
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,349
So now everything above is unlocked when
everything when things below are done.

1436
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:09,359
everything when things below are done.
 

1437
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,270
everything when things below are done.
So at the beginning you just have this

1438
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,280
So at the beginning you just have this
 

1439
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,150
So at the beginning you just have this
box you can run.

1440
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,160
box you can run.
 

1441
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,470
box you can run.
After you've done this these two have

1442
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:16,480
After you've done this these two have
 

1443
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,910
After you've done this these two have
unlocked. Does everyone see what I did

1444
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:17,920
unlocked. Does everyone see what I did
 

1445
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,150
unlocked. Does everyone see what I did
here? Just a visual representation. So

1446
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
here? Just a visual representation. So
 

1447
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,950
here? Just a visual representation. So
do the same thing just rotated.

1448
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:22,960
do the same thing just rotated.
 

1449
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,190
do the same thing just rotated.
Okay. So now these two have unlocked.

1450
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:27,200
Okay. So now these two have unlocked.
 

1451
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,829
Okay. So now these two have unlocked.
I can do both of those in parallel.

1452
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:29,839
I can do both of those in parallel.
 

1453
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,510
I can do both of those in parallel.
Everyone see that those can happen in

1454
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:31,520
Everyone see that those can happen in
 

1455
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,790
Everyone see that those can happen in
parallel. Then

1456
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:34,800
parallel. Then
 

1457
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,710
parallel. Then
this unlocks.

1458
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:36,720
this unlocks.
 

1459
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,710
this unlocks.
those three unlock and so on going up.

1460
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
those three unlock and so on going up.
 

1461
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,790
those three unlock and so on going up.
So this should remind you of something.

1462
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:42,800
So this should remind you of something.
 

1463
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,109
So this should remind you of something.
If you've taken a you've seen computer

1464
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:45,119
If you've taken a you've seen computer
 

1465
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,670
If you've taken a you've seen computer
architecture, the kind of pip

1466
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:47,680
architecture, the kind of pip
 

1467
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,870
architecture, the kind of pip
parallelism you have here is like

1468
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:48,880
parallelism you have here is like
 

1469
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,670
parallelism you have here is like
pipeline parallelism,

1470
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
pipeline parallelism,
 

1471
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,310
pipeline parallelism,
right? You can only the only amount of

1472
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:54,320
right? You can only the only amount of
 

1473
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,910
right? You can only the only amount of
parallelism you're ever going to get is

1474
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:55,920
parallelism you're ever going to get is
 

1475
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,030
parallelism you're ever going to get is
the number of layers.

1476
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,040
the number of layers.
 

1477
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,430
the number of layers.
So you have a sequence that's super

1478
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:01,440
So you have a sequence that's super
 

1479
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,470
So you have a sequence that's super
long, like a thousand, you have 20

1480
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:04,480
long, like a thousand, you have 20
 

1481
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,870
long, like a thousand, you have 20
layers. You're only ever going to be

1482
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:06,880
layers. You're only ever going to be
 

1483
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,430
layers. You're only ever going to be
able to execute 20 things in parallel.

1484
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,440
able to execute 20 things in parallel.
 

1485
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,430
able to execute 20 things in parallel.
And annoyingly they'll be different

1486
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,440
And annoyingly they'll be different
 

1487
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,190
And annoyingly they'll be different
things,

1488
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,200
things,
 

1489
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,670
things,
right? It'll be won't be the same matrix

1490
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:15,680
right? It'll be won't be the same matrix
 

1491
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,430
right? It'll be won't be the same matrix
applied to many different things. It'll

1492
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:17,440
applied to many different things. It'll
 

1493
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,670
applied to many different things. It'll
be a matrix for layer two and another

1494
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:19,680
be a matrix for layer two and another
 

1495
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,150
be a matrix for layer two and another
matrix for layer 1.

1496
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,160
matrix for layer 1.
 

1497
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,910
matrix for layer 1.
Then this will be a matrix for layer,

1498
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:23,920
Then this will be a matrix for layer,
 

1499
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,990
Then this will be a matrix for layer,
you know, three, two, and one.

1500
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,000
you know, three, two, and one.
 

1501
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,870
you know, three, two, and one.
So this isn't very friendly to hardware.

1502
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:32,880
So this isn't very friendly to hardware.
 

1503
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,550
So this isn't very friendly to hardware.
Does everyone see this kind of just

1504
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:34,560
Does everyone see this kind of just
 

1505
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,750
Does everyone see this kind of just
issue?

1506
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:37,760

 

1507
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,349

Okay.

1508
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:39,359
Okay.
 

1509
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,310
Okay.
So

1510
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:44,320

 

1511
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,390

this particular problem of how you this

1512
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:48,400
this particular problem of how you this
 

1513
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,390
this particular problem of how you this
challenge just one should recognize it's

1514
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,400
challenge just one should recognize it's
 

1515
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,470
challenge just one should recognize it's
a challenge. It has nothing to do with

1516
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:52,480
a challenge. It has nothing to do with
 

1517
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,589
a challenge. It has nothing to do with
whether it works well or not as a

1518
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:55,599
whether it works well or not as a
 

1519
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,630
whether it works well or not as a
network to do a actual job. It's just

1520
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:58,640
network to do a actual job. It's just
 

1521
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,390
network to do a actual job. It's just
that it's annoying to train.

1522
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,400
that it's annoying to train.
 

1523
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,630
that it's annoying to train.
Okay.

1524
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
Okay.
 

1525
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,430
Okay.
And the LSTM solution which got these

1526
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:07,440
And the LSTM solution which got these
 

1527
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,910
And the LSTM solution which got these
things to work well on practical

1528
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:09,920
things to work well on practical
 

1529
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,109
things to work well on practical
problems maintained this annoyance about

1530
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:13,119
problems maintained this annoyance about
 

1531
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,550
problems maintained this annoyance about
training. It's still hard to train

1532
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,560
training. It's still hard to train
 

1533
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,910
training. It's still hard to train
in parallel when you have long

1534
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:17,920
in parallel when you have long
 

1535
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,750
in parallel when you have long
sequences. So if you wanted to get

1536
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:19,760
sequences. So if you wanted to get
 

1537
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,109
sequences. So if you wanted to get
parallelism, you'd have to get it with

1538
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
parallelism, you'd have to get it with
 

1539
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,470
parallelism, you'd have to get it with
batches,

1540
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:24,480

 

1541
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,630

right? You'd have to have batches. But

1542
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
right? You'd have to have batches. But
 

1543
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,150
right? You'd have to have batches. But
you have very long things and you have

1544
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,160
you have very long things and you have
 

1545
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,710
you have very long things and you have
batches, it's kind of it's very tricky

1546
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:30,720
batches, it's kind of it's very tricky
 

1547
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,589
batches, it's kind of it's very tricky
to get it to um actually use utilize the

1548
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:33,599
to get it to um actually use utilize the
 

1549
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,910
to get it to um actually use utilize the
hardware in a very efficient way.

1550
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:39,920

 

1551
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,349

So we will return to this problem later

1552
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
So we will return to this problem later
 

1553
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,750
So we will return to this problem later
and how we resolve it.

1554
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:47,760
and how we resolve it.
 

1555
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,270
and how we resolve it.
Um

1556
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:49,280
Um
 

1557
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,870
Um
the

1558
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:50,880
the
 

1559
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,589
the
key comment here is that

1560
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:55,599
key comment here is that
 

1561
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,270
key comment here is that
in this operation

1562
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,280

 

1563
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,829

if you wanted to do this calculation

1564
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
if you wanted to do this calculation
 

1565
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,190
if you wanted to do this calculation
here at this level the reason that what

1566
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,200
here at this level the reason that what
 

1567
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,349
here at this level the reason that what
made this dependency happen was the fact

1568
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:09,359
made this dependency happen was the fact
 

1569
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,270
made this dependency happen was the fact
that there's nonlinearities in this path

1570
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:13,280
that there's nonlinearities in this path
 

1571
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,069
that there's nonlinearities in this path
because I can't execute the nonlinearity

1572
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:16,079
because I can't execute the nonlinearity
 

1573
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,670
because I can't execute the nonlinearity
like programmatically.

1574
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:19,680

 

1575
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,870

But if there wasn't a nonlinearity,

1576
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:22,880
But if there wasn't a nonlinearity,
 

1577
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,270
But if there wasn't a nonlinearity,
linear systems have all kinds of tricks

1578
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,280
linear systems have all kinds of tricks
 

1579
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,150
linear systems have all kinds of tricks
you can do to get them to like collapse

1580
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,160
you can do to get them to like collapse
 

1581
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,349
you can do to get them to like collapse
together and do stuff. So at the expense

1582
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:31,359
together and do stuff. So at the expense
 

1583
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,710
together and do stuff. So at the expense
of computation, you can do something and

1584
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:32,720
of computation, you can do something and
 

1585
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,510
of computation, you can do something and
that we'll talk about later. Okay. So

1586
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:37,520
that we'll talk about later. Okay. So
 

1587
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,990
that we'll talk about later. Okay. So
to help you understand what's going on

1588
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,000
to help you understand what's going on
 

1589
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,310
to help you understand what's going on
here, I'll just keep is I'm going to

1590
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:42,320
here, I'll just keep is I'm going to
 

1591
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,390
here, I'll just keep is I'm going to
like change pace a little bit on what

1592
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:44,400
like change pace a little bit on what
 

1593
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,990
like change pace a little bit on what
we're talking about.

1594
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,000
we're talking about.
 

1595
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,950
we're talking about.
I'm just going to make sure you

1596
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:46,960
I'm just going to make sure you
 

1597
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,030
I'm just going to make sure you
understand what's going on by sticking

1598
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,040
understand what's going on by sticking
 

1599
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,069
understand what's going on by sticking
to the purely linear case because I just

1600
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,079
to the purely linear case because I just
 

1601
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,270
to the purely linear case because I just
told you the nonlinearity is something

1602
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,280
told you the nonlinearity is something
 

1603
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,510
told you the nonlinearity is something
that we're going to question. So it's

1604
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:55,520
that we're going to question. So it's
 

1605
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,950
that we're going to question. So it's
worth thinking about just the linear

1606
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:56,960
worth thinking about just the linear
 

1607
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,550
worth thinking about just the linear
case first to make sure we understand

1608
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:58,560
case first to make sure we understand
 

1609
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,430
case first to make sure we understand
even the ideas.

1610
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,440
even the ideas.
 

1611
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,309
even the ideas.
So I'm just going to step back and ask

1612
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:04,319
So I'm just going to step back and ask
 

1613
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:06,950
So I'm just going to step back and ask
yourself what for you know filters like

1614
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
yourself what for you know filters like
 

1615
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,589
yourself what for you know filters like
what have you seen before?

1616
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:09,599
what have you seen before?
 

1617
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,309
what have you seen before?
So how many people have seen the common

1618
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:12,319
So how many people have seen the common
 

1619
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,349
So how many people have seen the common
filter in some class?

1620
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
filter in some class?
 

1621
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,430
filter in some class?
A few of you. Okay. So if you uh it's a

1622
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:19,440
A few of you. Okay. So if you uh it's a
 

1623
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,309
A few of you. Okay. So if you uh it's a
I think it's a standard topic in the um

1624
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
I think it's a standard topic in the um
 

1625
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,270
I think it's a standard topic in the um
probability courses like 126 uh to think

1626
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:25,280
probability courses like 126 uh to think
 

1627
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,470
probability courses like 126 uh to think
about common filtering but at some level

1628
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:28,480
about common filtering but at some level
 

1629
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,150
about common filtering but at some level
the details here are not of specifically

1630
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,160
the details here are not of specifically
 

1631
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,910
the details here are not of specifically
of common filtering is not important but

1632
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:33,920
of common filtering is not important but
 

1633
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,309
of common filtering is not important but
the problem is important.

1634
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:36,319
the problem is important.
 

1635
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,670
the problem is important.
So we're going to think about a little

1636
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:37,680
So we're going to think about a little
 

1637
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,230
So we're going to think about a little
toy problem. The toy problem is there's

1638
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:40,240
toy problem. The toy problem is there's
 

1639
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,990
toy problem. The toy problem is there's
an underlying true linear process. Okay.

1640
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,000
an underlying true linear process. Okay.
 

1641
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,990
an underlying true linear process. Okay.
So there's a true matrix A, there's a

1642
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,000
So there's a true matrix A, there's a
 

1643
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,390
So there's a true matrix A, there's a
true matrix B U, there's a true matrix

1644
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,400
true matrix B U, there's a true matrix
 

1645
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,470
true matrix B U, there's a true matrix
C, a true matrix D that exists and the

1646
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:52,480
C, a true matrix D that exists and the
 

1647
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,870
C, a true matrix D that exists and the
output is related in this way to the

1648
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:54,880
output is related in this way to the
 

1649
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,950
output is related in this way to the
input U.

1650
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:56,960
input U.
 

1651
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,190
input U.
However, there is also in this problem a

1652
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,200
However, there is also in this problem a
 

1653
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,270
However, there is also in this problem a
random

1654
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,280
random
 

1655
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,910
random
drawn according to a known distribution

1656
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:05,920
drawn according to a known distribution
 

1657
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,550
drawn according to a known distribution
disturbance that's entering the state

1658
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
disturbance that's entering the state
 

1659
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,190
disturbance that's entering the state
evolution and corrupting my

1660
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,200
evolution and corrupting my
 

1661
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,589
evolution and corrupting my
observations.

1662
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
observations.
 

1663
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,309
observations.
This is just the reality.

1664
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:16,319
This is just the reality.
 

1665
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,390
This is just the reality.
Now in a traditional treatment of common

1666
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:18,400
Now in a traditional treatment of common
 

1667
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,710
Now in a traditional treatment of common
filtering, I know all of these things. I

1668
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:20,720
filtering, I know all of these things. I
 

1669
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,510
filtering, I know all of these things. I
know the KW, KV and all these things.

1670
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:23,520
know the KW, KV and all these things.
 

1671
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,990
know the KW, KV and all these things.
And then one sets out and this is you

1672
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,000
And then one sets out and this is you
 

1673
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,750
And then one sets out and this is you
know like one or two or three lectures

1674
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:29,760
know like one or two or three lectures
 

1675
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,790
know like one or two or three lectures
uh to do it. You say okay if you observe

1676
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:34,800
uh to do it. You say okay if you observe
 

1677
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,069
uh to do it. You say okay if you observe
the 's and the y's

1678
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:38,079
the 's and the y's
 

1679
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,510
the 's and the y's
and you know all of these matrices

1680
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,520
and you know all of these matrices
 

1681
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,150
and you know all of these matrices
there's an optimal steadystate filter

1682
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
there's an optimal steadystate filter
 

1683
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,510
there's an optimal steadystate filter
that will estimate XT.

1684
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:47,520
that will estimate XT.
 

1685
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,990
that will estimate XT.
Okay, you can just work out a bunch of

1686
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:50,000
Okay, you can just work out a bunch of
 

1687
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,670
Okay, you can just work out a bunch of
math thinking about Gaussian

1688
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:51,680
math thinking about Gaussian
 

1689
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,950
math thinking about Gaussian
expectations and say basically this is

1690
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
expectations and say basically this is
 

1691
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,829
expectations and say basically this is
Gaussian, this is known.

1692
00:42:57,829 --> 00:42:57,839
Gaussian, this is known.
 

1693
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,270
Gaussian, this is known.
You know, you can remove this the

1694
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,280
You know, you can remove this the
 

1695
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,109
You know, you can remove this the
Gaussian. The Gaussian means all of

1696
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:01,119
Gaussian. The Gaussian means all of
 

1697
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,030
Gaussian. The Gaussian means all of
these things are Gaussian conditioned on

1698
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,040
these things are Gaussian conditioned on
 

1699
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,349
these things are Gaussian conditioned on
what you know. Joint Gaussians have

1700
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:05,359
what you know. Joint Gaussians have
 

1701
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,030
what you know. Joint Gaussians have
linear estimates that are optimal and

1702
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,040
linear estimates that are optimal and
 

1703
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,950
linear estimates that are optimal and
you can just grind out a bunch of

1704
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:08,960
you can just grind out a bunch of
 

1705
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,150
you can just grind out a bunch of
calculations to compute what happens

1706
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:12,160
calculations to compute what happens
 

1707
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,589
calculations to compute what happens
and you have uh an optimal filter that

1708
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:17,599
and you have uh an optimal filter that
 

1709
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,990
and you have uh an optimal filter that
has a linear structure. Right? So

1710
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:20,000
has a linear structure. Right? So
 

1711
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,550
has a linear structure. Right? So
there's the matrix

1712
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:22,560
there's the matrix
 

1713
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,750
there's the matrix
the matrices A, B,

1714
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:25,760
the matrices A, B,
 

1715
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,109
the matrices A, B,
C and D all figure in and there's

1716
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:29,119
C and D all figure in and there's
 

1717
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,430
C and D all figure in and there's
another matrix F that also comes in that

1718
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:31,440
another matrix F that also comes in that
 

1719
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,910
another matrix F that also comes in that
you have to compute and you can just

1720
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:33,920
you have to compute and you can just
 

1721
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,030
you have to compute and you can just
write out this is the best estimate for

1722
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,040
write out this is the best estimate for
 

1723
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,030
write out this is the best estimate for
predicting what the state is given the

1724
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:39,040
predicting what the state is given the
 

1725
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,190
predicting what the state is given the
observations

1726
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,200

 

1727
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,030

by linearity because things are

1728
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
by linearity because things are
 

1729
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,270
by linearity because things are
appearing in many different places. You

1730
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,280
appearing in many different places. You
 

1731
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,990
appearing in many different places. You
can fold things together and collapse it

1732
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,000
can fold things together and collapse it
 

1733
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,790
can fold things together and collapse it
into a matrix A tilda that applies to

1734
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:52,800
into a matrix A tilda that applies to
 

1735
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,030
into a matrix A tilda that applies to
the previous state of my filter, a

1736
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,040
the previous state of my filter, a
 

1737
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,230
the previous state of my filter, a
matrix B tilda that applies to my uh

1738
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:58,240
matrix B tilda that applies to my uh
 

1739
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,309
matrix B tilda that applies to my uh
observation and a matrix F applies to my

1740
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:02,319
observation and a matrix F applies to my
 

1741
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,390
observation and a matrix F applies to my
control and a matrix F that applies to

1742
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:04,400
control and a matrix F that applies to
 

1743
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,270
control and a matrix F that applies to
my observation and just have a recursive

1744
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:07,280
my observation and just have a recursive
 

1745
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,510
my observation and just have a recursive
update. So what does that mean? It means

1746
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:09,520
update. So what does that mean? It means
 

1747
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,670
update. So what does that mean? It means
there's a re interesting filters that

1748
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:11,680
there's a re interesting filters that
 

1749
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,710
there's a re interesting filters that
have this shape that we're studying.

1750
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:14,720
have this shape that we're studying.
 

1751
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,870
have this shape that we're studying.
Now there are formulas for these which

1752
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:16,880
Now there are formulas for these which
 

1753
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,309
Now there are formulas for these which
we don't have to worry about. Okay, if

1754
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:18,319
we don't have to worry about. Okay, if
 

1755
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,069
we don't have to worry about. Okay, if
you want to look them up, this is called

1756
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:20,079
you want to look them up, this is called
 

1757
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,630
you want to look them up, this is called
the discrete algebraic ricotti equation.

1758
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:22,640
the discrete algebraic ricotti equation.
 

1759
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,349
the discrete algebraic ricotti equation.
There's a solution to it. This is all in

1760
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:25,359
There's a solution to it. This is all in
 

1761
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,190
There's a solution to it. This is all in
talking about common filters. Okay, this

1762
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:27,200
talking about common filters. Okay, this
 

1763
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,790
talking about common filters. Okay, this
is not the subject of this class.

1764
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:28,800
is not the subject of this class.
 

1765
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,829
is not the subject of this class.
Important thing is that there are

1766
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:29,839
Important thing is that there are
 

1767
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,230
Important thing is that there are
formulas for these in if you knew what

1768
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
formulas for these in if you knew what
 

1769
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,910
formulas for these in if you knew what
all those matrices were. Okay, this is a

1770
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:35,920
all those matrices were. Okay, this is a
 

1771
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,270
all those matrices were. Okay, this is a
known classical problem when you know

1772
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:37,280
known classical problem when you know
 

1773
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,589
known classical problem when you know
what all the matrices are. So now we can

1774
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:39,599
what all the matrices are. So now we can
 

1775
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,190
what all the matrices are. So now we can
ask the question from a deep learning

1776
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:41,200
ask the question from a deep learning
 

1777
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,390
ask the question from a deep learning
class point of view that says

1778
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
class point of view that says
 

1779
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,150
class point of view that says
we have this filter if we knew what it

1780
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160
we have this filter if we knew what it
 

1781
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,950
we have this filter if we knew what it
was. But what if we don't know these

1782
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
was. But what if we don't know these
 

1783
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,230
was. But what if we don't know these
matrices?

1784
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:52,240

 

1785
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,550

So I don't know the underlying A

1786
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:54,560
So I don't know the underlying A
 

1787
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,270
So I don't know the underlying A
dynamics, the B dynamics, the C, the D,

1788
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:57,280
dynamics, the B dynamics, the C, the D,
 

1789
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,990
dynamics, the B dynamics, the C, the D,
the coariance of the W or the coariance

1790
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,000
the coariance of the W or the coariance
 

1791
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,069
the coariance of the W or the coariance
of the V. I know none of these things.

1792
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:04,079
of the V. I know none of these things.
 

1793
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,430
of the V. I know none of these things.
So if you have no none of these things,

1794
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:05,440
So if you have no none of these things,
 

1795
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,150
So if you have no none of these things,
it's hopeless. I have to have something

1796
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:08,160
it's hopeless. I have to have something
 

1797
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,390
it's hopeless. I have to have something
right to be able to make this filter. So

1798
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:10,400
right to be able to make this filter. So
 

1799
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,069
right to be able to make this filter. So
it's a deep learning class. So I have to

1800
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:12,079
it's a deep learning class. So I have to
 

1801
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,150
it's a deep learning class. So I have to
be able to learn the filter. So I have

1802
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
be able to learn the filter. So I have
 

1803
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,670
be able to learn the filter. So I have
to learn the filter from some kind of

1804
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:15,680
to learn the filter from some kind of
 

1805
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,349
to learn the filter from some kind of
data.

1806
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:17,359
data.
 

1807
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,630
data.
Everyone with me? So what kind of data

1808
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:20,640
Everyone with me? So what kind of data
 

1809
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,109
Everyone with me? So what kind of data
do I want? Well, the best data that I'd

1810
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:23,119
do I want? Well, the best data that I'd
 

1811
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,190
do I want? Well, the best data that I'd
like is I'd like data that looks like

1812
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,200
like is I'd like data that looks like
 

1813
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,030
like is I'd like data that looks like
this.

1814
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,040
this.
 

1815
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,950
this.
And this is data where I have the ground

1816
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:28,960
And this is data where I have the ground
 

1817
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,910
And this is data where I have the ground
truth state for some reason for a trace.

1818
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:31,920
truth state for some reason for a trace.
 

1819
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,950
truth state for some reason for a trace.
That's the thing I want to predict,

1820
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:32,960
That's the thing I want to predict,
 

1821
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,550
That's the thing I want to predict,
right? I want my common filter predicts

1822
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:34,560
right? I want my common filter predicts
 

1823
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,309
right? I want my common filter predicts
what the state is.

1824
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:36,319
what the state is.
 

1825
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,710
what the state is.
the state isn't directly observed. But

1826
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:38,720
the state isn't directly observed. But
 

1827
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,870
the state isn't directly observed. But
for my ground truth data, my training

1828
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:40,880
for my ground truth data, my training
 

1829
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,150
for my ground truth data, my training
data, let's suppose I actually had

1830
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:42,160
data, let's suppose I actually had
 

1831
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,670
data, let's suppose I actually had
proper labels. So I have the true states

1832
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:45,680
proper labels. So I have the true states
 

1833
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,670
proper labels. So I have the true states
and I have the things I want to that are

1834
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:47,680
and I have the things I want to that are
 

1835
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,390
and I have the things I want to that are
my inputs, which are these inputs U.

1836
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:50,400
my inputs, which are these inputs U.
 

1837
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,270
my inputs, which are these inputs U.
Oops, I'm using the wrong mode,

1838
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:55,280
Oops, I'm using the wrong mode,
 

1839
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,069
Oops, I'm using the wrong mode,
right? I have my inputs U and Y.

1840
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:00,079
right? I have my inputs U and Y.
 

1841
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,470
right? I have my inputs U and Y.
These are the inputs to my learning

1842
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:02,480
These are the inputs to my learning
 

1843
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,870
These are the inputs to my learning
system, right? And I want to learn from

1844
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:04,880
system, right? And I want to learn from
 

1845
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,910
system, right? And I want to learn from
traces of u's and y's how to predict

1846
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:07,920
traces of u's and y's how to predict
 

1847
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,150
traces of u's and y's how to predict
x's.

1848
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:10,160
x's.
 

1849
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,510
x's.
Everyone with me in terms of setting up

1850
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
Everyone with me in terms of setting up
 

1851
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,470
Everyone with me in terms of setting up
the problem. So this is a sequential

1852
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,480
the problem. So this is a sequential
 

1853
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,270
the problem. So this is a sequential
prediction problem where I'm get given

1854
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:17,280
prediction problem where I'm get given
 

1855
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,430
prediction problem where I'm get given
u's and y's and I want to predict x's.

1856
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,440

 

1857
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,750

Any questions on the problem?

1858
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:27,760

 

1859
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,349

So I can have batches of them. I have a

1860
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:29,359
So I can have batches of them. I have a
 

1861
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,030
So I can have batches of them. I have a
large set of these sequences. So I have

1862
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,040
large set of these sequences. So I have
 

1863
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,790
large set of these sequences. So I have
you know J indexes over these traces

1864
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
you know J indexes over these traces
 

1865
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,270
you know J indexes over these traces
that I have captured and you know

1866
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:35,280
that I have captured and you know
 

1867
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,870
that I have captured and you know
there's some large number of them.

1868
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:38,880
there's some large number of them.
 

1869
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,069
there's some large number of them.
The traces might be of different

1870
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:40,079
The traces might be of different
 

1871
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,710
The traces might be of different
lengths. I some short traces, I have

1872
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:42,720
lengths. I some short traces, I have
 

1873
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,550
lengths. I some short traces, I have
some long traces. It doesn't matter

1874
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:44,560
some long traces. It doesn't matter
 

1875
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,309
some long traces. It doesn't matter
because I'm weight sharing across time.

1876
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
because I'm weight sharing across time.
 

1877
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,670
because I'm weight sharing across time.
I don't have to have the same length of

1878
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:47,680
I don't have to have the same length of
 

1879
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,750
I don't have to have the same length of
trace in my training data.

1880
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,760

 

1881
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,109

Okay. So what do we do?

1882
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:57,119
Okay. So what do we do?
 

1883
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,630
Okay. So what do we do?
I need a tilda, bilda, and f. I don't

1884
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:00,640
I need a tilda, bilda, and f. I don't
 

1885
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,150
I need a tilda, bilda, and f. I don't
know what they are. Once I have a tilda,

1886
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,160
know what they are. Once I have a tilda,
 

1887
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,430
know what they are. Once I have a tilda,
b tilda, and f, of course, I can just

1888
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:03,440
b tilda, and f, of course, I can just
 

1889
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,190
b tilda, and f, of course, I can just
write this equation down and I'll have

1890
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:05,200
write this equation down and I'll have
 

1891
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,349
write this equation down and I'll have
the filter I want. So my whole problem

1892
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:07,359
the filter I want. So my whole problem
 

1893
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,390
the filter I want. So my whole problem
is I need to figure out what a tilda bf.

1894
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:10,400
is I need to figure out what a tilda bf.
 

1895
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,230
is I need to figure out what a tilda bf.
So I deem them learnable parameters.

1896
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:14,240
So I deem them learnable parameters.
 

1897
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,990
So I deem them learnable parameters.
Good.

1898
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:16,000
Good.
 

1899
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,430
Good.
I want to estimate.

1900
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,440
I want to estimate.
 

1901
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,430
I want to estimate.
What sense do I want to estimate x? Mean

1902
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:21,440
What sense do I want to estimate x? Mean
 

1903
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,190
What sense do I want to estimate x? Mean
squared error sense. That's what common

1904
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:23,200
squared error sense. That's what common
 

1905
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,630
squared error sense. That's what common
filter optimizes. So I can put a loss a

1906
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:26,640
filter optimizes. So I can put a loss a
 

1907
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,150
filter optimizes. So I can put a loss a
squared loss on my prediction xhat.

1908
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:30,160
squared loss on my prediction xhat.
 

1909
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,349
squared loss on my prediction xhat.
So now I have a loss function.

1910
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
So now I have a loss function.
 

1911
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,230
So now I have a loss function.
So now I have a formula which has

1912
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,240
So now I have a formula which has
 

1913
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,430
So now I have a formula which has
unknown learnable parameters in it.

1914
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:39,440
unknown learnable parameters in it.
 

1915
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,030
unknown learnable parameters in it.
And

1916
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:41,040
And
 

1917
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,270
And
I can run it

1918
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
I can run it
 

1919
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,750
I can run it
for inputs u and y. Everyone with me?

1920
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760
for inputs u and y. Everyone with me?
 

1921
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,390
for inputs u and y. Everyone with me?
And I have a loss. So I can just go.

1922
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,400
And I have a loss. So I can just go.
 

1923
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,390
And I have a loss. So I can just go.
Does everyone see this? I just like set

1924
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,400
Does everyone see this? I just like set
 

1925
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,190
Does everyone see this? I just like set
it up and run.

1926
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:55,200
it up and run.
 

1927
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,349
it up and run.
So

1928
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:57,359
So
 

1929
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,829
So
what does that look like?

1930
00:47:59,829 --> 00:47:59,839
what does that look like?
 

1931
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:05,990
what does that look like?
Looks like this.

1932
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000

 

1933
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,990

I have losses squared loss up here and I

1934
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,000
I have losses squared loss up here and I
 

1935
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,470
I have losses squared loss up here and I
have

1936
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:12,480
have
 

1937
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,390
have
these boxes that are parameterized by a

1938
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:14,400
these boxes that are parameterized by a
 

1939
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,349
these boxes that are parameterized by a
tilda b and I have different u's and y's

1940
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:17,359
tilda b and I have different u's and y's
 

1941
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,510
tilda b and I have different u's and y's
that go in them.

1942
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:19,520
that go in them.
 

1943
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,630
that go in them.
Everyone sees this? This works. So now

1944
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:22,640
Everyone sees this? This works. So now
 

1945
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,870
Everyone sees this? This works. So now
what do I do? I have to initialize a

1946
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:24,880
what do I do? I have to initialize a
 

1947
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,710
what do I do? I have to initialize a
tilda b tilda and f to something

1948
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:28,720
tilda b tilda and f to something
 

1949
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,470
tilda b tilda and f to something
right. I do some random initialization

1950
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:30,480
right. I do some random initialization
 

1951
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,589
right. I do some random initialization
of a tilda b tilda and ff. I then

1952
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:33,599
of a tilda b tilda and ff. I then
 

1953
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,990
of a tilda b tilda and ff. I then
proceed to run uh gradient descent. So

1954
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:36,000
proceed to run uh gradient descent. So
 

1955
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,589
proceed to run uh gradient descent. So
I'll get losses you know that uh

1956
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:39,599
I'll get losses you know that uh
 

1957
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:51,030
I'll get losses you know that uh
back prop this way

1958
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,040

 

1959
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,990

and so on

1960
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:54,000
and so on
 

1961
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,670
and so on
losses will back prop the system I'll

1962
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
losses will back prop the system I'll
 

1963
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,910
losses will back prop the system I'll
get updates I can run and I can see what

1964
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:57,920
get updates I can run and I can see what
 

1965
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,390
get updates I can run and I can see what
happens

1966
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:00,400
happens
 

1967
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,549
happens
okay any questions on this this will

1968
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:02,559
okay any questions on this this will
 

1969
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,069
okay any questions on this this will
help make the kind of problem extremely

1975
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,510

Yeah. what's the connection between this

going to have ground truth for the state

Yeah, we'll come to that next.

2030
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:29,359
Yeah, we'll come to that next.
 

2031
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,670
Yeah, we'll come to that next.
>> Right. Right now, we just have we have

00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:31,680
>> Right. Right now, we just have we have
 

2033

2035
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,950
use and Y's and we have labels X. And
given the fact that we have labels X, we

2036
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:36,960
given the fact that we have labels X, we
 

2037
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,510
given the fact that we have labels X, we
can set up a loss on a per output level

2038
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:41,520
can set up a loss on a per output level
 

2039
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,470
can set up a loss on a per output level
and run back prop and have this thing

2040
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:44,480
and run back prop and have this thing
 

2041
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,270
and run back prop and have this thing
converge and run.

2042
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:47,280
converge and run.
 

2043
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,109
converge and run.
Okay, we can choose the optimizer we

2044
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:49,119
Okay, we can choose the optimizer we
 

2045
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,950
Okay, we can choose the optimizer we
want. Like all the normal choices we

2046
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:50,960
want. Like all the normal choices we
 

2047
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,950
want. Like all the normal choices we
have in setting it up, we can do. We

2048
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:52,960
have in setting it up, we can do. We
 

2049
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,069
have in setting it up, we can do. We
have to make sure our gradients don't

2050
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:54,079
have to make sure our gradients don't
 

2051
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,750
have to make sure our gradients don't
explode.

2052
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:55,760
explode.
 

2053
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,109
explode.
So that means we have to initialize it

2054
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
So that means we have to initialize it
 

2055
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,549
So that means we have to initialize it
properly. Initialize it properly so that

2056
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
properly. Initialize it properly so that
 

2057
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,910
properly. Initialize it properly so that
a at initialization is stable. A tilda

2058
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:03,920
a at initialization is stable. A tilda
 

2059
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,470
a at initialization is stable. A tilda
is stable.

2060
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:06,480
is stable.
 

2061
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,670
is stable.
And the nice thing is that if you look

2062
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:09,680
And the nice thing is that if you look
 

2063
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,430
And the nice thing is that if you look
up here for if you knew the formulas,

2064
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:13,440
up here for if you knew the formulas,
 

2065
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,870
up here for if you knew the formulas,
the formula you have uh for what the

2066
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:16,880
the formula you have uh for what the
 

2067
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,270
the formula you have uh for what the
optimal value looks like is also

2068
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:19,280
optimal value looks like is also
 

2069
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,349
optimal value looks like is also
something that's uh stable.

2070
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:23,359
something that's uh stable.
 

2071
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,270
something that's uh stable.
Common filters when they run correctly

2072
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:25,280
Common filters when they run correctly
 

2073
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,390
Common filters when they run correctly
are are stable.

2074
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:28,400
are are stable.
 

2075
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,870
are are stable.
If the as long as the underlying U's and

2076
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:30,880
If the as long as the underlying U's and
 

2077
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,069
If the as long as the underlying U's and
Y's aren't blowing up, right,

2078
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:32,079
Y's aren't blowing up, right,
 

2079
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:43,030
Y's aren't blowing up, right,
everything's good. Yeah.

2080
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,040

 

2081
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,670

ality show up here. So everything in

2082
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:45,680
ality show up here. So everything in
 

2083
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,430
ality show up here. So everything in
this network operates causally. So

2084
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:47,440
this network operates causally. So
 

2085
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,069
this network operates causally. So
everything flows this way. The losses

2086
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
everything flows this way. The losses
 

2087
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,829
everything flows this way. The losses
here are individual. They just tell you

2088
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:51,839
here are individual. They just tell you
 

2089
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,270
here are individual. They just tell you
there's a loss on the individual output

2090
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
there's a loss on the individual output
 

2091
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,950
there's a loss on the individual output
of this box. There's a another loss on

2092
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:54,960
of this box. There's a another loss on
 

2093
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,309
of this box. There's a another loss on
the individual output of this box

2094
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:56,319
the individual output of this box
 

2095
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:57,750
the individual output of this box
because you know this box is supposed to

2096
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:57,760
because you know this box is supposed to
 

2097
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,870
because you know this box is supposed to
predict xhat at time t plus one. I know

2098
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:00,880
predict xhat at time t plus one. I know
 

2099
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,190
predict xhat at time t plus one. I know
x actually at time t plus one. So I can

2100
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,200
x actually at time t plus one. So I can
 

2101
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:09,109
x actually at time t plus one. So I can
put a squared loss here.

2102
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:09,119

 

2103
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,109

But from the perspective of gradient

2130
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:40,720
But from the perspective of gradient
 

2131
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,349
But from the perspective of gradient
descent, I don't care about any of that.

00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:43,359
descent, I don't care about any of that.
 

2133
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,549
descent, I don't care about any of that.
Just run this and it'll it converges.

2134
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:46,559
Just run this and it'll it converges.
 

2135
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,230
Just run this and it'll it converges.
I have to choose usual things. I choose

2136
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:48,240
I have to choose usual things. I choose
 

2137
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,430
I have to choose usual things. I choose
learning rate, right? All that stuff

2138
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:49,440
learning rate, right? All that stuff
 

2139
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,990
learning rate, right? All that stuff
happens. But this works.

2140
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,000
happens. But this works.
 

2141
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,750
happens. But this works.
Um,

2142
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:53,760
Um,
 

2143
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,990
Um,
okay. Hopefully that's all good. Okay.

2144
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:58,000
okay. Hopefully that's all good. Okay.
 

2145
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,069
okay. Hopefully that's all good. Okay.
Now, here comes the more interesting

2146
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:02,079
Now, here comes the more interesting
 

2147
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,109
Now, here comes the more interesting
question.

2148
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:05,119

 

2149
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,670

What if you didn't have any of the

2150
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:07,680
What if you didn't have any of the
 

2151
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,150
What if you didn't have any of the
labels?

2152
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:10,160
labels?
 

2153
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:16,630
labels?
All you have was use and wise.

2154
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:16,640

 

2155
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,150

Okay. So here

2156
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,160
Okay. So here
 

2157
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,030
Okay. So here
the states are unobserved to you. You

2158
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,040
the states are unobserved to you. You
 

2159
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,990
the states are unobserved to you. You
don't see them at all.

2160
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:26,000
don't see them at all.
 

2161
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,150
don't see them at all.
Can you learn how to do common

2162
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,160
Can you learn how to do common
 

2163
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,630
Can you learn how to do common
filtering? And the answer is clearly no.

2164
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,640
filtering? And the answer is clearly no.
 

2165
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,069
filtering? And the answer is clearly no.
Right? You can't. But why is the answer

2166
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:36,079
Right? You can't. But why is the answer
 

2167
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,510
Right? You can't. But why is the answer
no? Right? You don't have the labels of

2168
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:39,520
no? Right? You don't have the labels of
 

2169
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,510
no? Right? You don't have the labels of
what this state is but why is the answer

2170
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:41,520
what this state is but why is the answer
 

2171
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,950
what this state is but why is the answer
no? So right now take two minutes talk

2172
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:44,960
no? So right now take two minutes talk
 

2173
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,670
no? So right now take two minutes talk
to your uh neighbors and ask why can't I

2174
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:49,680
to your uh neighbors and ask why can't I
 

2175
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,430
to your uh neighbors and ask why can't I
do this?

2176
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:51,440
do this?
 

2177
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,829
do this?
Why is this not possible? So question

2178
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:53,839
Why is this not possible? So question
 

2179
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,870
Why is this not possible? So question
I'll write write the question

2180
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:56,880
I'll write write the question
 

2181
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:23,349
I'll write write the question
question.

2182
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:23,359

 

2183
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,309

Okay. So, talk talk to your neighbors.

2184
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:26,319
Okay. So, talk talk to your neighbors.
 

2185
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:34,069
Okay. So, talk talk to your neighbors.
I will set a timer.

2186
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:34,079

 

2187
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,990

I'll just put the equations up here so

2188
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,000
I'll just put the equations up here so
 

2189
00:54:36,000 --> 00:55:19,349
I'll just put the equations up here so
you can see them.

2190
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:19,359

 

2191
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:37,670

We don't know.

2192
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:37,680

 

2193
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:59,910

Oh,

2194
00:55:59,910 --> 00:55:59,920

 

2195
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,069

So think

2196
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:02,079
So think
 

2197
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,589
So think
question everyone. Is everyone done

2198
00:56:03,589 --> 00:56:03,599
question everyone. Is everyone done
 

2199
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,349
question everyone. Is everyone done
thinking? Talk talk more to your f

2200
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:05,359
thinking? Talk talk more to your f
 

2201
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,589
thinking? Talk talk more to your f
neighbors. Another 15 seconds or

2202
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:07,599
neighbors. Another 15 seconds or
 

2203
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:37,829
neighbors. Another 15 seconds or
something.

2204
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:37,839

 

2205
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,510

Okay.

2206
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:39,520
Okay.
 

2207
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,549
Okay.
So

2208
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:42,559

 

2209
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,390

let's come back together and say so we

2210
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,400
let's come back together and say so we
 

2211
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,829
let's come back together and say so we
have input output behavior traces of the

2212
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:49,839
have input output behavior traces of the
 

2213
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,510
have input output behavior traces of the
underlying system this guy

2214
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:53,520
underlying system this guy
 

2215
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,230
underlying system this guy
and the question is can we learn to

2216
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:56,240
and the question is can we learn to
 

2217
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,630
and the question is can we learn to
predict its state

2218
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:58,640
predict its state
 

2219
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,829
predict its state
right from this data that's the question

2220
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:01,839
right from this data that's the question
 

2221
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,470
right from this data that's the question
can we learn the full common filter so

2222
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:04,480
can we learn the full common filter so
 

2223
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,390
can we learn the full common filter so
how many people think the answer is yes

2224
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:06,400
how many people think the answer is yes
 

2225
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,710
how many people think the answer is yes
we can

2226
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:08,720
we can
 

2227
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,069
we can
think the answer is no. We cannot.

2228
00:57:12,069 --> 00:57:12,079
think the answer is no. We cannot.
 

2229
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,430
think the answer is no. We cannot.
Okay, some people are kind of

2230
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,440
Okay, some people are kind of
 

2231
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,670
Okay, some people are kind of
tentatively no. So now the question no

2232
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:15,680
tentatively no. So now the question no
 

2233
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,870
tentatively no. So now the question no
is correct. We cannot. So the question

2234
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:18,880
is correct. We cannot. So the question
 

2235
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,990
is correct. We cannot. So the question
is why not?

2236
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:22,000
is why not?
 

2237
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,270
is why not?
Right? So if you want to generally how

2238
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:25,280
Right? So if you want to generally how
 

2239
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,109
Right? So if you want to generally how
do you think of meta question if you

2240
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:27,119
do you think of meta question if you
 

2241
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,270
do you think of meta question if you
want to answer the question that says

2242
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:29,280
want to answer the question that says
 

2243
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,109
want to answer the question that says
it's impossible

2244
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,119
it's impossible
 

2245
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,750
it's impossible
to learn X

2246
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:33,760
to learn X
 

2247
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,829
to learn X
from this right? What is the nature of

2248
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:37,839
from this right? What is the nature of
 

2249
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,510
from this right? What is the nature of
the argument? the standard argument that

2250
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:39,520
the argument? the standard argument that
 

2251
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,230
the argument? the standard argument that
will tell you it is impossible to learn

2252
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:42,240
will tell you it is impossible to learn
 

2253
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,630
will tell you it is impossible to learn
this from this.

2254
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:44,640
this from this.
 

2255
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,390
this from this.
Okay. Yeah.

2256
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:46,400
Okay. Yeah.
 

2257
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,589
Okay. Yeah.
>> Contradiction.

2258
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
>> Contradiction.
 

2259
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,789
>> Contradiction.
>> Contradiction. That's

2260
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:50,799
>> Contradiction. That's
 

2261
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,670
>> Contradiction. That's
that's kind of the right spirit. But

2262
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:53,680
that's kind of the right spirit. But
 

2263
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,270
that's kind of the right spirit. But
what do you mean contradiction?

2264
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:55,280
what do you mean contradiction?
 

2265
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,750
what do you mean contradiction?
>> I assume it's true.

2266
00:57:59,750 --> 00:57:59,760

 

2267
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,430

>> Okay. That's a normal way of showing

2268
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:01,440
>> Okay. That's a normal way of showing
 

2269
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,430
>> Okay. That's a normal way of showing
that something is impossible. But here

2270
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:03,440
that something is impossible. But here
 

2271
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,870
that something is impossible. But here
has to be more specific like what

2272
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:06,880
has to be more specific like what
 

2273
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,150
has to be more specific like what
you want to say that it can yeah how do

2274
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:10,160
you want to say that it can yeah how do
 

2275
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,549
you want to say that it can yeah how do
you show that something isn't learnable?

2276
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:14,559

 

2277
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,710

>> Yeahep.

2278
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:16,720
>> Yeahep.
 

2279
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,030
>> Yeahep.
>> Independence. Okay. So when you say what

2280
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,040
>> Independence. Okay. So when you say what
 

2281
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:28,230
>> Independence. Okay. So when you say what
do you mean by independence?

2282
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:28,240

 

2283
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,829

>> Okay. So independence is a very strong

2284
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:29,839
>> Okay. So independence is a very strong
 

2285
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,710
>> Okay. So independence is a very strong
form of something where you say what I

2286
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:32,720
form of something where you say what I
 

2287
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,789
form of something where you say what I
have is completely independent. Now here

2288
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:34,799
have is completely independent. Now here
 

2289
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,670
have is completely independent. Now here
it's clearly not

2290
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:37,680
it's clearly not
 

2291
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,549
it's clearly not
okay because the underlying behavior of

2292
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:40,559
okay because the underlying behavior of
 

2293
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,470
okay because the underlying behavior of
this filter. So again for those I'm

2294
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:42,480
this filter. So again for those I'm
 

2295
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,109
this filter. So again for those I'm
going to for to help some people um if

2296
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:45,119
going to for to help some people um if
 

2297
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,789
going to for to help some people um if
you've seen this from the perspective of

2298
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:46,799
you've seen this from the perspective of
 

2299
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,870
you've seen this from the perspective of
transfer functions remember this thing

2300
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:50,880
transfer functions remember this thing
 

2301
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,710
transfer functions remember this thing
is determining where the poles are

2302
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:54,720
is determining where the poles are
 

2303
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,589
is determining where the poles are
right of this thing and this is so you

2304
00:58:57,589 --> 00:58:57,599
right of this thing and this is so you
 

2305
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,069
right of this thing and this is so you
can actually see a lot of it about this

2306
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:00,079
can actually see a lot of it about this
 

2307
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,630
can actually see a lot of it about this
transfer function from the input output

2308
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:02,640
transfer function from the input output
 

2309
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,950
transfer function from the input output
behavior. In fact you can see the entire

2310
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:04,960
behavior. In fact you can see the entire
 

2311
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,309
behavior. In fact you can see the entire
transfer function from the input output

2312
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:06,319
transfer function from the input output
 

2313
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,470
transfer function from the input output
behavior. So you're certainly a it's

2314
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:08,480
behavior. So you're certainly a it's
 

2315
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,710
behavior. So you're certainly a it's
definitely not independent.

2316
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:10,720
definitely not independent.
 

2317
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,309
definitely not independent.
Okay.

2318
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:12,319
Okay.
 

2319
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:21,750
Okay.
Yeah.

2320
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:21,760

 

2321
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,349

>> Okay. Very good. If you want to show

2322
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:23,359
>> Okay. Very good. If you want to show
 

2323
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,349
>> Okay. Very good. If you want to show
that it's impossible to learn something,

2324
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:25,359
that it's impossible to learn something,
 

2325
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,190
that it's impossible to learn something,
one way of saying is that there's it's

2326
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:27,200
one way of saying is that there's it's
 

2327
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,349
one way of saying is that there's it's
impossible because there's two answers

2328
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:29,359
impossible because there's two answers
 

2329
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,510
impossible because there's two answers
at least that are compatible with the

2330
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:31,520
at least that are compatible with the
 

2331
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,069
at least that are compatible with the
same behavior. All your data would be

2332
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:34,079
same behavior. All your data would be
 

2333
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,430
same behavior. All your data would be
identical under these two options, but

2334
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:35,440
identical under these two options, but
 

2335
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,270
identical under these two options, but
these two options are different. So

2336
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:37,280
these two options are different. So
 

2337
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,470
these two options are different. So
there's no way you could tell these

2338
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:38,480
there's no way you could tell these
 

2339
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,030
there's no way you could tell these
apart. Does everyone see that? So it's

2340
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,040
apart. Does everyone see that? So it's
 

2341
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,190
apart. Does everyone see that? So it's
underdetermined, right? Is the

2342
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:43,200
underdetermined, right? Is the
 

2343
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,150
underdetermined, right? Is the
perspective. This is a weaker thing than

2344
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:46,160
perspective. This is a weaker thing than
 

2345
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,430
perspective. This is a weaker thing than
independence. Independence is very

2346
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:47,440
independence. Independence is very
 

2347
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,950
independence. Independence is very
strong. Nothing to do with each other.

2348
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:48,960
strong. Nothing to do with each other.
 

2349
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,870
strong. Nothing to do with each other.
This is like well there's something

2350
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:50,880
This is like well there's something
 

2351
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,470
This is like well there's something
you're not seeing. Okay. So who can tell

2352
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:54,480
you're not seeing. Okay. So who can tell
 

2353
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,510
you're not seeing. Okay. So who can tell
me why this is underdetermined?

2354
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:57,520
me why this is underdetermined?
 

2355
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,230
me why this is underdetermined?
So think about X as having state

2356
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240
So think about X as having state
 

2357
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,829
So think about X as having state
dimension of having two. It was two

2358
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:01,839
dimension of having two. It was two
 

2359
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:08,470
dimension of having two. It was two
dimensional state just for simplicity.

2360
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:08,480

 

2361
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,910

Do everyone see the nature of the

2362
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:09,920
Do everyone see the nature of the
 

2363
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,030
Do everyone see the nature of the
argument? You have to tell me that

2364
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:11,040
argument? You have to tell me that
 

2365
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,630
argument? You have to tell me that
there's you can't predict the state

2366
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:12,640
there's you can't predict the state
 

2367
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,069
there's you can't predict the state
because it could be this or it could be

2368
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:14,079
because it could be this or it could be
 

2369
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,430
because it could be this or it could be
this and there's no way you'd ever know

2370
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:15,440
this and there's no way you'd ever know
 

2371
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,549
this and there's no way you'd ever know
the difference.

2372
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:18,559
the difference.
 

2373
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,910
the difference.
>> Um, yeah.

2374
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:21,920
>> Um, yeah.
 

2375
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,589
>> Um, yeah.
>> Ah, the question is because there's

2376
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:23,599
>> Ah, the question is because there's
 

2377
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,789
>> Ah, the question is because there's
noise. Okay, now that's actually quite

2378
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:26,799
noise. Okay, now that's actually quite
 

2379
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:29,990
noise. Okay, now that's actually quite
subtle, right? Because there's noise,

2380
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:30,000
subtle, right? Because there's noise,
 

2381
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,069
subtle, right? Because there's noise,
what that usually means is you can't

2382
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:32,079
what that usually means is you can't
 

2383
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,549
what that usually means is you can't
predict X perfectly. But even the common

2384
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:34,559
predict X perfectly. But even the common
 

2385
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,549
predict X perfectly. But even the common
filter doesn't do it perfectly. common

2386
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:36,559
filter doesn't do it perfectly. common
 

2387
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,349
filter doesn't do it perfectly. common
filter has some no some error. So saying

2388
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:39,359
filter has some no some error. So saying
 

2389
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:42,549
filter has some no some error. So saying
that I can't do it perfectly isn't the

2390
01:00:42,549 --> 01:00:42,559
that I can't do it perfectly isn't the
 

2391
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,470
that I can't do it perfectly isn't the
doesn't doesn't work. What you want to

2392
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:44,480
doesn't doesn't work. What you want to
 

2393
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,230
doesn't doesn't work. What you want to
say is you can't do it in any sort of

2394
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:46,240
say is you can't do it in any sort of
 

2395
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,870
say is you can't do it in any sort of
reasonable way. There's no way I'm going

2396
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:48,880
reasonable way. There's no way I'm going
 

2397
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,549
reasonable way. There's no way I'm going
to expect imperfection. So that doesn't

2398
01:00:50,549 --> 01:00:50,559
to expect imperfection. So that doesn't
 

2399
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,829
to expect imperfection. So that doesn't
work.

2400
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:51,839
work.
 

2401
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,390
work.
>> Yeah,

2402
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:52,400
>> Yeah,
 

2403
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:58,309
>> Yeah,
>> maybe you need some initial state.

2404
01:00:58,309 --> 01:00:58,319

 

2405
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,630

>> Okay. So one question is maybe it's

2406
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:00,640
>> Okay. So one question is maybe it's
 

2407
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,150
>> Okay. So one question is maybe it's
because the initial state is not

2408
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:02,160
because the initial state is not
 

2409
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,150
because the initial state is not
observed. Okay. Let's just assume that a

2410
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:06,160
observed. Okay. Let's just assume that a
 

2411
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,190
observed. Okay. Let's just assume that a
this a is stable very stable and so the

2412
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:09,200
this a is stable very stable and so the
 

2413
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,750
this a is stable very stable and so the
initial state will be forgotten soon

2414
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:11,760
initial state will be forgotten soon
 

2415
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,470
initial state will be forgotten soon
soon enough and the traces are long so

2416
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:14,480
soon enough and the traces are long so
 

2417
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,349
soon enough and the traces are long so
then it doesn't matter okay or I can

2418
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:17,359
then it doesn't matter okay or I can
 

2419
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:18,789
then it doesn't matter okay or I can
just tell you I say the all the initial

2420
01:01:18,789 --> 01:01:18,799
just tell you I say the all the initial
 

2421
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,630
just tell you I say the all the initial
states are always zero it's not the

2422
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
states are always zero it's not the
 

2423
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,750
states are always zero it's not the
initial state that's the issue here

2424
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:23,760
initial state that's the issue here
 

2425
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,829
initial state that's the issue here
think about this is two dimensional

2426
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:29,839

 

2427
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:32,630

why can't I do this

01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:32,640
why can't I do this
 

2429
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:41,109
why can't I do this
Yeah.

2430
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:41,119

observations Y connect to X through C.
 

2447
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,910
observations Y connect to X through C.
Okay. And they connect to you through C

2448
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:03,920
Okay. And they connect to you through C
 

2449

Okay. And they connect to you through C
A B is what you wanted to say, right? B

2450
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:08,319
A B is what you wanted to say, right? B
 

2451
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:12,069
A B is what you wanted to say, right? B
in U encounters B then it encounters A

2452
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:12,079
in U encounters B then it encounters A
 

2453
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,030
in U encounters B then it encounters A
or you know encounters B and then C and

2454
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:15,040
or you know encounters B and then C and
 

2455
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,910
or you know encounters B and then C and
so on. Right? So the important thing

2456
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:17,920
so on. Right? So the important thing
 

2457
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,910
so on. Right? So the important thing
here is that this path the path that

2458
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:21,920
here is that this path the path that
 

2459
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,470
here is that this path the path that
goes through X involves products of

2460
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
goes through X involves products of
 

2461
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,030
goes through X involves products of
matrices.

2462
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,040
matrices.
 

2463
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,430
matrices.
And so the question is maybe there's

2464
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,440
And so the question is maybe there's
 

2465
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,030
And so the question is maybe there's
things you can do to the individual

2466
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:31,040
things you can do to the individual
 

2467
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,630
things you can do to the individual
matrices so that the effect on the

2468
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
matrices so that the effect on the
 

2469
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,950
matrices so that the effect on the
product cancels out. That's the spirit

2470
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
product cancels out. That's the spirit
 

2471
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,870
product cancels out. That's the spirit
of what you're saying, right? Okay,

2472
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:36,880
of what you're saying, right? Okay,
 

2473
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,349
of what you're saying, right? Okay,
that's that's really good intuition, but

2474
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:39,359
that's that's really good intuition, but
 

2475
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,670
that's that's really good intuition, but
can you make it more concrete? Can you

2476
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:41,680
can you make it more concrete? Can you
 

2477
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,510
can you make it more concrete? Can you
give me a specific example to start with

2478
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:43,520
give me a specific example to start with
 

2479
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,270
give me a specific example to start with
one example

2480
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,280
one example
 

2481
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:51,589
one example
of a kind of thing you could do?

2482
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:51,599

 

2483
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,910

X is two dimensional

2484
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:53,920
X is two dimensional
 

2485
01:02:53,920 --> 01:03:03,030
X is two dimensional
for the example.

2486
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:03,040

 

2487
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,829

Okay, so just a meta thing. When

2488
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:05,839
Okay, so just a meta thing. When
 

2489
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,910
Okay, so just a meta thing. When
something is small dimensions, you have

2490
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:07,920
something is small dimensions, you have
 

2491
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,789
something is small dimensions, you have
a few go-to things you can do. Okay,

2492
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:10,799
a few go-to things you can do. Okay,
 

2493
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:13,349
a few go-to things you can do. Okay,
whenever you have linear algebra things,

2494
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:13,359
whenever you have linear algebra things,
 

2495
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:16,069
whenever you have linear algebra things,
you always want to say ask the question,

2496
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:16,079
you always want to say ask the question,
 

2497
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,750
you always want to say ask the question,
does change of coordinates change

2498
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:17,760
does change of coordinates change
 

2499
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,829
does change of coordinates change
something? This would be your go-to

2500
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:19,839
something? This would be your go-to
 

2501
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,230
something? This would be your go-to
thing. If I change coordinates,

2502
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:22,240
thing. If I change coordinates,
 

2503
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,190
thing. If I change coordinates,
will it be visible to me? And your go-to

2504
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,200
will it be visible to me? And your go-to
 

2505
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,270
will it be visible to me? And your go-to
change of coordinates in terms of

2506
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:27,280
change of coordinates in terms of
 

2507
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,150
change of coordinates in terms of
intuition is for two dimensions is swap

2508
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:30,160
intuition is for two dimensions is swap
 

2509
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,750
intuition is for two dimensions is swap
the role of x and y of the two

2510
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:31,760
the role of x and y of the two
 

2511
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,510
the role of x and y of the two
dimensions.

2512
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:33,520
dimensions.
 

2513
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,109
dimensions.
Does everyone see like this is just

2514
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:35,119
Does everyone see like this is just
 

2515
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,789
Does everyone see like this is just
heristics? How do you think about

2516
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:36,799
heristics? How do you think about
 

2517
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,309
heristics? How do you think about
things?

2518
01:03:38,309 --> 01:03:38,319
things?
 

2519
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,829
things?
So

2520
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:39,839
So
 

2521
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,710
So
in this case if you swapped the two

2522
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:42,720
in this case if you swapped the two
 

2523
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,710
in this case if you swapped the two
dimensions in the state you say actually

2524
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:44,720
dimensions in the state you say actually
 

2525
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,150
dimensions in the state you say actually
the first dimension was the second

2526
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:46,160
the first dimension was the second
 

2527
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,390
the first dimension was the second
dimension

2528
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:48,400
dimension
 

2529
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,990
dimension
that would be a permutation of rows

2530
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:52,000
that would be a permutation of rows
 

2531
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,990
that would be a permutation of rows
of this thing.

2532
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,000
of this thing.
 

2533
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,670
of this thing.
You could correspondingly permute the

2534
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:55,680
You could correspondingly permute the
 

2535
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,990
You could correspondingly permute the
columns of C and you wouldn't tell the

2536
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,000
columns of C and you wouldn't tell the
 

2537
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,190
columns of C and you wouldn't tell the
difference. Does everyone see that?

2538
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,200
difference. Does everyone see that?
 

2539
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,950
difference. Does everyone see that?
Like suppose one of them is the Yeah.

2540
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:02,960
Like suppose one of them is the Yeah.
 

2541
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,069
Like suppose one of them is the Yeah.
You see? So clearly I can permute.

2542
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:06,079
You see? So clearly I can permute.
 

2543
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,589
You see? So clearly I can permute.
There's no way to know the internal

2544
01:04:07,589 --> 01:04:07,599
There's no way to know the internal
 

2545
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:12,470
There's no way to know the internal
structure of X to permutation.

2546
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480

 

2547
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,109

Does everyone see that? So it's clearly

2548
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:15,119
Does everyone see that? So it's clearly
 

2549
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:21,190
Does everyone see that? So it's clearly
not possible to get it.

2550
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,200

 

2551
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,829

Okay. Now you can go deeper.

2552
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:25,839
Okay. Now you can go deeper.
 

2553
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:28,950
Okay. Now you can go deeper.
Suppose I did a change of coordinates,

2554
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:28,960
Suppose I did a change of coordinates,
 

2555
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,029
Suppose I did a change of coordinates,
a generic change of coordinates. So

2556
01:04:31,029 --> 01:04:31,039
a generic change of coordinates. So
 

2557
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,430
a generic change of coordinates. So
instead of looking at X, I look at X

2558
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:33,440
instead of looking at X, I look at X
 

2559
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,190
instead of looking at X, I look at X
through an invertible map.

2560
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:37,200
through an invertible map.
 

2561
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,549
through an invertible map.
I can definitely change coordinates

2562
01:04:38,549 --> 01:04:38,559
I can definitely change coordinates
 

2563
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,589
I can definitely change coordinates
here. Change the A matrix appropriately.

2564
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:41,599
here. Change the A matrix appropriately.
 

2565
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,870
here. Change the A matrix appropriately.
Change of coordinates. So this dynamic

2566
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:42,880
Change of coordinates. So this dynamic
 

2567
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,069
Change of coordinates. So this dynamic
gets preserved and make sure that

2568
01:04:44,069 --> 01:04:44,079
gets preserved and make sure that
 

2569
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,910
gets preserved and make sure that
coordinate transformation shows up in B

2570
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:45,920
coordinate transformation shows up in B
 

2571
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,069
coordinate transformation shows up in B
appropriately. If I chose that

2572
01:04:48,069 --> 01:04:48,079
appropriately. If I chose that
 

2573
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,430
appropriately. If I chose that
coordinate transformation for example.

2574
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:51,440
coordinate transformation for example.
 

2575
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,870
coordinate transformation for example.
Yeah. So, and then that coordinate

2576
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:52,880
Yeah. So, and then that coordinate
 

2577
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,470
Yeah. So, and then that coordinate
transformation will also affect the

2578
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
transformation will also affect the
 

2579
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,990
transformation will also affect the
effective W, which would just simply

2580
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,000
effective W, which would just simply
 

2581
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,829
effective W, which would just simply
change my coariance matrix.

2582
01:04:59,829 --> 01:04:59,839
change my coariance matrix.
 

2583
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,589
change my coariance matrix.
So, this thing I can definitely update

2584
01:05:01,589 --> 01:05:01,599
So, this thing I can definitely update
 

2585
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:04,069
So, this thing I can definitely update
for a change of coordinates. But that

2586
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:04,079
for a change of coordinates. But that
 

2587
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:05,670
for a change of coordinates. But that
means I can put the inverse of that

2588
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:05,680
means I can put the inverse of that
 

2589
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,910
means I can put the inverse of that
change of coordinates here to get back

2590
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:07,920
change of coordinates here to get back
 

2591
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,349
change of coordinates here to get back
to the original coordinates and change C

2592
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:09,359
to the original coordinates and change C
 

2593
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,470
to the original coordinates and change C
appropriately. Does everyone see this?

2594
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:12,480
appropriately. Does everyone see this?
 

2595
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,589
appropriately. Does everyone see this?
And the endto-end behavior of U all the

2596
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:15,599
And the endto-end behavior of U all the
 

2597
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,870
And the endto-end behavior of U all the
way into Y would not change because it

2598
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:18,880
way into Y would not change because it
 

2599
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,789
way into Y would not change because it
gets reversed. the change according is

2600
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:20,799
gets reversed. the change according is
 

2601
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:24,549
gets reversed. the change according is
reversed. So, okay, ask questions if you

2602
01:05:24,549 --> 01:05:24,559
reversed. So, okay, ask questions if you
 

2603
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:25,990
reversed. So, okay, ask questions if you
don't understand this. This is like very

2604
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,000
don't understand this. This is like very
 

2605
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,349
don't understand this. This is like very
basic, but it's going to lead to

2606
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:27,359
basic, but it's going to lead to
 

2607
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:31,270
basic, but it's going to lead to
something immediately for us.

2608
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:31,280
something immediately for us.
 

2609
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:31,670
something immediately for us.
>> Yeah.

2610
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,680
>> Yeah.
 

2611
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,029
>> Yeah.
>> Are you basically doing a change of

2612
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,039
>> Are you basically doing a change of
 

2613
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:34,870
>> Are you basically doing a change of
basis twice?

2614
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:34,880
basis twice?
 

2615
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,230
basis twice?
>> We're just doing a change of basis once

2616
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:36,240
>> We're just doing a change of basis once
 

2617
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,549
>> We're just doing a change of basis once
on X.

2618
01:05:38,549 --> 01:05:38,559
on X.
 

2619
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,990
on X.
Okay. And we're saying that if you do a

2620
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:40,000
Okay. And we're saying that if you do a
 

2621
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,510
Okay. And we're saying that if you do a
change of basis on X, it doesn't change

2622
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:41,520
change of basis on X, it doesn't change
 

2623
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,829
change of basis on X, it doesn't change
the behavior of this thing. And we can

2624
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:43,839
the behavior of this thing. And we can
 

2625
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,349
the behavior of this thing. And we can
account for that change of basis and

2626
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:45,359
account for that change of basis and
 

2627
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,109
account for that change of basis and
see.

2628
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:47,119
see.
 

2629
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,390
see.
So there's no way of learning what's

2630
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
So there's no way of learning what's
 

2631
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,910
So there's no way of learning what's
going on in X up to changes of basis.

2632
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:55,920

 

2633
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:56,470

>> Yeah.

2634
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:56,480
>> Yeah.
 

2635
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,190
>> Yeah.
>> You say like a bigger picture because

2641
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,029

Yes, that was the first comment right

2642
01:06:09,029 --> 01:06:09,039
Yes, that was the first comment right
 

2643
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,349
Yes, that was the first comment right
that somehow yeah the the fact that

2644
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:11,359
that somehow yeah the the fact that
 

2645
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,430
that somehow yeah the the fact that
information is flowing through a product

2646
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,440
information is flowing through a product
 

2647
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,230
information is flowing through a product
of matrices means that you can have

2648
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:16,240
of matrices means that you can have
 

2649
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,510
of matrices means that you can have
cancelling changes in these

2650
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:19,520
cancelling changes in these
 

2651
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,029
cancelling changes in these
right in particular any change of

2652
01:06:21,029 --> 01:06:21,039
right in particular any change of
 

2653
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:23,510
right in particular any change of
coordinates of x

coordinates of x
 

2655
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,109
coordinates of x
will not be you can't learn them

01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:27,119
will not be you can't learn them
 

2657
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,829
will not be you can't learn them
because you won't see them

01:06:29,829 --> 01:06:29,839
because you won't see them
 

2659
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,069
because you won't see them
okay but now you ask this question

2660
01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:32,079
okay but now you ask this question
 

2661
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,910
okay but now you ask this question
question

2662
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:33,920
question
 

2663
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,510
question

01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
Why does it matter if you change it to
 

2667
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:40,789
Why does it matter if you change it to
basis?

2668
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:40,799
basis?
 

2669
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:43,349
basis?
>> Excellent question. So what I'm saying

2670
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:43,359
>> Excellent question. So what I'm saying
 

2671
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:47,029

here is that our goal is to learn about
 

2673
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,870
here is that our goal is to learn about
the system and ask what can we learn if

01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:50,880
the system and ask what can we learn if

01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,950
tell you the state right because it's
not unique I could reparameterize the

2694
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:10,960
not unique I could reparameterize the
 

2695
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,630
not unique I could reparameterize the
state up to a change of coordinate and I

2696
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:12,640
state up to a change of coordinate and I
 

2697
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,950
state up to a change of coordinate and I
won't get it

2698
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:14,960
won't get it
 

2699
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,150
won't get it
do you see that like that's the problem

2700
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:18,160
do you see that like that's the problem
 

2701
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,829
do you see that like that's the problem
so the question is what do we actually

2702
01:07:19,829 --> 01:07:19,839
so the question is what do we actually
 

2703
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:22,069
so the question is what do we actually
want is the question we have to ask so

2704
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
want is the question we have to ask so
 

2705
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,630
want is the question we have to ask so
we can't get this we simply can't get it

2706
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:26,640
we can't get this we simply can't get it
 

2707
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,789
we can't get this we simply can't get it
so the next question becomes is there

2708
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:28,799
so the next question becomes is there
 

2709
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:33,029
so the next question becomes is there
any hope to get anything at all

2710
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:33,039
any hope to get anything at all
 

2711
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,630
any hope to get anything at all
right is there anything that doesn't

2712
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:34,640
right is there anything that doesn't
 

2713
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,230
right is there anything that doesn't
that's actually there that I could try

2714
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:36,240
that's actually there that I could try
 

2715
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,349
that's actually there that I could try
to get. So you ask yourself the question

2716
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:39,359
to get. So you ask yourself the question
 

2717
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,829
to get. So you ask yourself the question
if I have a matrix A

2718
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:41,839
if I have a matrix A
 

2719
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:43,990
if I have a matrix A
and I can apply change of coordinates to

2720
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,000
and I can apply change of coordinates to
 

2721
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,390
and I can apply change of coordinates to
it and it won't change the behavior for

2722
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:46,400
it and it won't change the behavior for
 

2723
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,549
it and it won't change the behavior for
me is there anything about that A that

2724
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:50,559
me is there anything about that A that
 

2725
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,710
me is there anything about that A that
is actually learnable.

2726
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:54,720

 

2727
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,470

So if I take a matrix and I do

2728
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,480
So if I take a matrix and I do
 

2729
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,270
So if I take a matrix and I do
similarity transforms to it

2730
01:07:59,270 --> 01:07:59,280
similarity transforms to it
 

2731
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,910
similarity transforms to it
is anything preserved?

2732
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
is anything preserved?
 

2733
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,109
is anything preserved?
>> Yeah. EN values are preserved. The IGEN

2734
01:08:05,109 --> 01:08:05,119
>> Yeah. EN values are preserved. The IGEN
 

2735
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:07,349
>> Yeah. EN values are preserved. The IGEN
value structure entirely is preserved.

2736
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:07,359
value structure entirely is preserved.
 

2737
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,670
value structure entirely is preserved.
So there is something

2738
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:09,680
So there is something
 

2739
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,630
So there is something
that you can learn and the something is

2740
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:12,640
that you can learn and the something is
 

2741
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,109
that you can learn and the something is
useful.

2742
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:15,119
useful.
 

2743
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,709
useful.
Why is it useful? Think from a practical

2744
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:16,719
Why is it useful? Think from a practical
 

2745
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,590
Why is it useful? Think from a practical
point of view in real life in problems.

2746
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:19,600
point of view in real life in problems.
 

2747
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,269
point of view in real life in problems.
The challenge is hey I don't I have a

2748
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:23,279
The challenge is hey I don't I have a
 

2749
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,829
The challenge is hey I don't I have a
lot of unlabeled data for the system. I

2750
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
lot of unlabeled data for the system. I
 

2751
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,269
lot of unlabeled data for the system. I
have a lot of input output behavior for

2752
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:27,279
have a lot of input output behavior for
 

2753
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,829
have a lot of input output behavior for
the system. I don't have like looking at

2754
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:29,839
the system. I don't have like looking at
 

2755
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:33,030
the system. I don't have like looking at
the state. But maybe you can have a

2756
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:33,040
the state. But maybe you can have a
 

2757
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,749
the state. But maybe you can have a
small amount of data that will actually

2758
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:35,759
small amount of data that will actually
 

2759
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,309
small amount of data that will actually
tell you what the state is.

2760
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:38,319
tell you what the state is.
 

2761
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,669
tell you what the state is.
And the learning problem becomes is

2762
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:39,679
And the learning problem becomes is
 

2763
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,749
And the learning problem becomes is
there any way of leveraging a mass of

2764
01:08:41,749 --> 01:08:41,759
there any way of leveraging a mass of
 

2765
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,269
there any way of leveraging a mass of
unlabelled

2766
01:08:43,269 --> 01:08:43,279
unlabelled
 

2767
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:47,030
unlabelled
data to help me get more use out of the

2768
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:47,040
data to help me get more use out of the
 

2769
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,430
data to help me get more use out of the
label data.

2770
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:49,440
label data.
 

2771
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,950
label data.
Okay, this should sound familiar to

2772
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:50,960
Okay, this should sound familiar to
 

2773
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,550
Okay, this should sound familiar to
people.

2774
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:52,560
people.
 

2775
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,990
people.
Okay, so now the question is is go back

2776
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:56,000
Okay, so now the question is is go back
 

2777
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,630
Okay, so now the question is is go back
to this question. You know what? Can you

2778
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:58,640
to this question. You know what? Can you
 

2779
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,910
to this question. You know what? Can you
you can't learn this. So this the answer

2780
01:08:59,910 --> 01:08:59,920
you can't learn this. So this the answer
 

2781
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:06,070
you can't learn this. So this the answer
here is no. Let me just uh sorry.

2782
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:06,080

 

2783
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:14,390

Okay. So the answer here is no.

2784
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,400

 

2785
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:23,189

Can change coordinates.

2786
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:23,199

 

2787
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:25,110

X

2788
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:25,120
X
 

2789
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,189
X
and

2790
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:27,199
and
 

2791
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:40,309
and
this is unobservable.

2792
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:40,319

 

2793
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,590

Okay. So I can't do this.

2794
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:43,600
Okay. So I can't do this.
 

2795
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,149
Okay. So I can't do this.
But suppose we say

2796
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:46,159
But suppose we say
 

2797
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:49,910
But suppose we say
okay I can't do this

2798
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:49,920
okay I can't do this
 

2799
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,310
okay I can't do this
but I want to learn something.

2800
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:54,320
but I want to learn something.
 

2801
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,669
but I want to learn something.
Right? I know there's something that

2802
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:55,679
Right? I know there's something that
 

2803
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,149
Right? I know there's something that
might be able to be learned. How can I

2804
01:09:58,149 --> 01:09:58,159
might be able to be learned. How can I
 

2805
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:03,270
might be able to be learned. How can I
rig it up to learn something?

2806
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:03,280

 

2807
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,110

So, this is a kind of a weird situation,

2808
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:05,120
So, this is a kind of a weird situation,
 

2809
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,830
So, this is a kind of a weird situation,
right? So, I have the U's and the Y's

2810
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:07,840
right? So, I have the U's and the Y's
 

2811
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,430
right? So, I have the U's and the Y's
and they're definitely the inputs here.

2812
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:11,440
and they're definitely the inputs here.
 

2813
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,430
and they're definitely the inputs here.
Okay? Like, that's for sure. I have

2814
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:13,440
Okay? Like, that's for sure. I have
 

2815
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,270
Okay? Like, that's for sure. I have
boxes here that have these different

2816
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,280
boxes here that have these different
 

2817
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,270
boxes here that have these different
parameters in them. I know I'm not going

2818
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:17,280
parameters in them. I know I'm not going
 

2819
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,870
parameters in them. I know I'm not going
to get these parameters good enough to

2820
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:18,880
to get these parameters good enough to
 

2821
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,430
to get these parameters good enough to
be a common filter. Okay? But I still

2822
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:21,440
be a common filter. Okay? But I still
 

2823
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,189
be a common filter. Okay? But I still
have three par three matrices in here

2824
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:23,199
have three par three matrices in here
 

2825
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:28,070
have three par three matrices in here
that I can learn in my filter.

2826
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:28,080

 

2827
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,830

So

2828
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:29,840
So
 

2829
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,390
So
the kind of highle question is is there

2830
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:32,400
the kind of highle question is is there
 

2831
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,110
the kind of highle question is is there
anything that I could try to predict

2832
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:35,120
anything that I could try to predict
 

2833
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,510
anything that I could try to predict
that would give me a way to get this

2834
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:37,520
that would give me a way to get this
 

2835
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,750
that would give me a way to get this
process to run.

2836
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:41,760

 

2837
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,750

So you ask yourself

2838
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:45,760
So you ask yourself
 

2839
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,990
So you ask yourself
if I have this xhat t and the xhat t is

2840
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:50,000
if I have this xhat t and the xhat t is
 

2841
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,470
if I have this xhat t and the xhat t is
sort of correct right you go back up

2842
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:54,480
sort of correct right you go back up
 

2843
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,550
sort of correct right you go back up
to

2844
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:56,560
to
 

2845
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,790
to
you know how one deres the idea of the

2846
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:58,800
you know how one deres the idea of the
 

2847
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,189
you know how one deres the idea of the
common filter

2848
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:01,199
common filter
 

2849
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:04,630
common filter
there's aspects here

2850
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:04,640
there's aspects here
 

2851
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,709
there's aspects here
that are predictable

2852
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:08,719
that are predictable
 

2853
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:11,669
that are predictable
right I've updated the state in some way

2854
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:11,679
right I've updated the state in some way
 

2855
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,630
right I've updated the state in some way
and if the next input were something

2856
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:14,640
and if the next input were something
 

2857
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,390
and if the next input were something
different here's the way to think about

2858
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:16,400
different here's the way to think about
 

2859
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,070
different here's the way to think about
it if the next input were something

2860
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:18,080
it if the next input were something
 

2861
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:22,470
it if the next input were something
different you could predict its output

2862
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:22,480
different you could predict its output
 

2863
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,990
different you could predict its output
does everyone see that if I've learned

2864
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:24,000
does everyone see that if I've learned
 

2865
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,990
does everyone see that if I've learned
the dynamics that the endto-end behavior

2866
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,000
the dynamics that the endto-end behavior
 

2867
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,709
the dynamics that the endto-end behavior
of use's to y's if the next input were

2868
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:28,719
of use's to y's if the next input were
 

2869
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:31,030
of use's to y's if the next input were
different I could predict the output in

2870
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:31,040
different I could predict the output in
 

2871
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,750
different I could predict the output in
particular if the next input were a zero

2872
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:33,760
particular if the next input were a zero
 

2873
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,750
particular if the next input were a zero
I could predict it or something so now

2874
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:37,760
I could predict it or something so now
 

2875
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,750
I could predict it or something so now
you can use that idea

2876
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:41,760

 

2877
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,270

here.

2878
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:45,280

 

2879
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,630

So you can say look what I'm going to do

2880
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:48,640
So you can say look what I'm going to do
 

2881
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,830
So you can say look what I'm going to do
is I will give access in the loss I have

2882
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:51,840
is I will give access in the loss I have
 

2883
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,270
is I will give access in the loss I have
to pick a label. So the label

2884
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:55,280
to pick a label. So the label
 

2885
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,430
to pick a label. So the label
these two 's and y's have a different

2886
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:57,440
these two 's and y's have a different
 

2887
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,510
these two 's and y's have a different
character. The u is an input. It's

2888
01:11:59,510 --> 01:11:59,520
character. The u is an input. It's
 

2889
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,550
character. The u is an input. It's
arbitrary. It could be anything.

2890
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:02,560
arbitrary. It could be anything.
 

2891
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,430
arbitrary. It could be anything.
The y is determined once all the 's are

2892
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:05,440
The y is determined once all the 's are
 

2893
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,750
The y is determined once all the 's are
determined.

2894
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:07,760
determined.
 

2895
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,590
determined.
So, the thing I might want to predict is

2896
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:09,600
So, the thing I might want to predict is
 

2897
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:22,630
So, the thing I might want to predict is
the next Y.

2898
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:22,640

 

2899
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,669

I have it,

2900
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:25,679
I have it,
 

2901
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,229
I have it,
right? I have the next Y. So, I could

2902
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:28,239
right? I have the next Y. So, I could
 

2903
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:31,189
right? I have the next Y. So, I could
try to predict it. So, this one I can

2904
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:31,199
try to predict it. So, this one I can
 

2905
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:35,430
try to predict it. So, this one I can
predict try to predict Y t plus 2.

2906
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:35,440
predict try to predict Y t plus 2.
 

2907
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:42,709
predict try to predict Y t plus 2.
Here I can try to predict yt plus 3.

2908
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:42,719

 

2909
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,189

Does everyone see that?

2910
01:12:45,189 --> 01:12:45,199
Does everyone see that?
 

2911
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,189
Does everyone see that?
Now

2912
01:12:47,189 --> 01:12:47,199
Now
 

2913
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:49,430
Now
this thing is trying to update its

2914
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:49,440
this thing is trying to update its
 

2915
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,550
this thing is trying to update its
recursive state. The recursive state has

2916
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:52,560
recursive state. The recursive state has
 

2917
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,790
recursive state. The recursive state has
the wrong type at the very least. It's

2918
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:54,800
the wrong type at the very least. It's
 

2919
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,910
the wrong type at the very least. It's
the wrong size to be a prediction of y.

2920
01:12:57,910 --> 01:12:57,920
the wrong size to be a prediction of y.
 

2921
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,550
the wrong size to be a prediction of y.
Suppose the state is two dimensional and

2922
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:00,560
Suppose the state is two dimensional and
 

2923
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,110
Suppose the state is two dimensional and
my y's are fivedimensional.

2924
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,120
my y's are fivedimensional.
 

2925
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,510
my y's are fivedimensional.
So I need some kind of translation box

2926
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:05,520
So I need some kind of translation box
 

2927
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,510
So I need some kind of translation box
at the minimum

2928
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:07,520
at the minimum
 

2929
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,030
at the minimum
to get something I can run the loss on.

2930
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,040
to get something I can run the loss on.
 

2931
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,430
to get something I can run the loss on.
Does everyone see that? I've decided I

2932
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:11,440
Does everyone see that? I've decided I
 

2933
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,790
Does everyone see that? I've decided I
want to try to learn whatever I can

2934
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:12,800
want to try to learn whatever I can
 

2935
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,270
want to try to learn whatever I can
learn. So I have to see what could I

2936
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:15,280
learn. So I have to see what could I
 

2937
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,350
learn. So I have to see what could I
even hope to predict in this setup. I

2938
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:17,360
even hope to predict in this setup. I
 

2939
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,470
even hope to predict in this setup. I
can hope to predict the y.

2940
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:20,480
can hope to predict the y.
 

2941
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,750
can hope to predict the y.
But actually

2942
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:23,760

 

2943
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:40,709

if I also added this arc

2944
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:40,719

 

2945
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:53,030

and I said this is a linear

2946
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:53,040

 

2947
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,550

Okay, does everyone see what's going on

2948
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
Okay, does everyone see what's going on
 

2949
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,110
Okay, does everyone see what's going on
here? Here I'm saying that I have my

2950
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:57,120
here? Here I'm saying that I have my
 

2951
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,630
here? Here I'm saying that I have my
estimate for what the state is.

2952
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:00,640
estimate for what the state is.
 

2953
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,910
estimate for what the state is.
If I knew the next

2954
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:03,920
If I knew the next
 

2955
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,630
If I knew the next
input,

2956
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:06,640
input,
 

2957
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,350
input,
right, I could predict something about

2958
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:09,360
right, I could predict something about
 

2959
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,669
right, I could predict something about
the next output.

2960
01:14:11,669 --> 01:14:11,679
the next output.
 

2961
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,550
the next output.
So I can go ahead and use that and I

2962
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:14,560
So I can go ahead and use that and I
 

2963
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,310
So I can go ahead and use that and I
have a linear layer here.

2964
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:18,320
have a linear layer here.
 

2965
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,030
have a linear layer here.
If I run this, what I'm going to try to

2966
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:21,040
If I run this, what I'm going to try to
 

2967
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,229
If I run this, what I'm going to try to
get is something which is trying to

2968
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
get is something which is trying to
 

2969
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:27,030
get is something which is trying to
basically distill out what is the

2970
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:27,040
basically distill out what is the
 

2971
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,310
basically distill out what is the
dynamics of the underlying state up to

2972
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:30,320
dynamics of the underlying state up to
 

2973
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,870
dynamics of the underlying state up to
coordinate transformation

2974
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:32,880
coordinate transformation
 

2975
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,310
coordinate transformation
because that's the best I can hope for.

2976
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:34,320
because that's the best I can hope for.
 

2977
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,990
because that's the best I can hope for.
What is it that I'm never going to see

2978
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,000
What is it that I'm never going to see
 

2979
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,750
What is it that I'm never going to see
the extra information in this? So here

2980
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:39,760
the extra information in this? So here
 

2981
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,830
the extra information in this? So here
I'm trying to predict this Y. The extra

2982
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:41,840
I'm trying to predict this Y. The extra
 

2983
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,350
I'm trying to predict this Y. The extra
information in this Y is carrying

2984
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:43,360
information in this Y is carrying
 

2985
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,550
information in this Y is carrying
information about the underlying

2986
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:44,560
information about the underlying
 

2987
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,070
information about the underlying
disturbance and the underlying noises.

2988
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,080
disturbance and the underlying noises.
 

2989
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,590
disturbance and the underlying noises.
I'm never going to predict the noise.

2990
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:49,600
I'm never going to predict the noise.
 

2991
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,149
I'm never going to predict the noise.
That's an irreducible loss.

2992
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:52,159
That's an irreducible loss.
 

2993
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,070
That's an irreducible loss.
But you learn from your ML class. You

2994
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:54,080
But you learn from your ML class. You
 

2995
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,350
But you learn from your ML class. You
don't care. They give you reducible

2996
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:55,360
don't care. They give you reducible
 

2997
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,550
don't care. They give you reducible
loss. That's not a problem. Doesn't stop

2998
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:56,560
loss. That's not a problem. Doesn't stop
 

2999
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,709
loss. That's not a problem. Doesn't stop
you from learning. You just hope they

3000
01:14:58,709 --> 01:14:58,719
you from learning. You just hope they
 

3001
01:14:58,719 --> 01:14:59,830
you from learning. You just hope they
cancel out with the appropriate

3002
01:14:59,830 --> 01:14:59,840
cancel out with the appropriate
 

3003
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,910
cancel out with the appropriate
averaging.

3004
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:01,920
averaging.
 

3005
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,750
averaging.
Similarly, there's an irreducible loss

3006
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:03,760
Similarly, there's an irreducible loss
 

3007
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,990
Similarly, there's an irreducible loss
that comes from the disturbance,

3008
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:06,000
that comes from the disturbance,
 

3009
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,830
that comes from the disturbance,
right? The next disturbance. You're

3010
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:07,840
right? The next disturbance. You're
 

3011
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,390
right? The next disturbance. You're
never going to see that. That's okay.

3012
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:10,400
never going to see that. That's okay.
 

3013
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,669
never going to see that. That's okay.
You can still learn the core pattern.

3014
01:15:13,669 --> 01:15:13,679
You can still learn the core pattern.
 

3015
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,510
You can still learn the core pattern.
Okay. So, this example of trying to do

3016
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:17,520
Okay. So, this example of trying to do
 

3017
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,310
Okay. So, this example of trying to do
filtering sequentially actually shows

3018
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:20,320
filtering sequentially actually shows
 

3019
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,310
filtering sequentially actually shows
you

3020
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:22,320
you
 

3021
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,750
you
that you can learn something. This what

3022
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:25,760
that you can learn something. This what
 

3023
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,910
that you can learn something. This what
this gives you is a some kind of the

3024
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:27,920
this gives you is a some kind of the
 

3025
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,430
this gives you is a some kind of the
filter

3026
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:29,440
filter
 

3027
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,350
filter
up to some invariance. This is

3028
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:31,360
up to some invariance. This is
 

3029
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,510
up to some invariance. This is
definitely not unique. There's many many

3030
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:33,520
definitely not unique. There's many many
 

3031
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,709
definitely not unique. There's many many
solutions here. So, this is where things

3032
01:15:36,709 --> 01:15:36,719
solutions here. So, this is where things
 

3033
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,709
solutions here. So, this is where things
so is this a convex problem? No, it's

3034
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
so is this a convex problem? No, it's
 

3035
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:41,350
so is this a convex problem? No, it's
not a convex problem. But that doesn't

3036
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:41,360
not a convex problem. But that doesn't
 

3037
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,830
not a convex problem. But that doesn't
scare us in deep learning,

3038
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:43,840
scare us in deep learning,
 

3039
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,229
scare us in deep learning,
right? It's not convex. Nothing is

3040
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:46,239
right? It's not convex. Nothing is
 

3041
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:48,630
right? It's not convex. Nothing is
convex. Nothing we ever do is convex

3042
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:48,640
convex. Nothing we ever do is convex
 

3043
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,149
convex. Nothing we ever do is convex
because everything we have is always has

3044
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:50,159
because everything we have is always has
 

3045
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:52,550
because everything we have is always has
these symmetries that we can't learn,

3046
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:52,560
these symmetries that we can't learn,
 

3047
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,470
these symmetries that we can't learn,
right?

3048
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
right?
 

3049
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,590
right?
Does everyone see that? Even in

3050
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,600
Does everyone see that? Even in
 

3051
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,669
Does everyone see that? Even in
continents, it's not convex. Nothing is

3052
01:15:57,669 --> 01:15:57,679
continents, it's not convex. Nothing is
 

3053
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,390
continents, it's not convex. Nothing is
convex. Doesn't stop us. So, we can just

3054
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,400
convex. Doesn't stop us. So, we can just
 

3055
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,950
convex. Doesn't stop us. So, we can just
do it. Now, we have to see what happens.

3056
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:02,960
do it. Now, we have to see what happens.
 

3057
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,950
do it. Now, we have to see what happens.
Does it converge to something, right?

3058
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:04,960
Does it converge to something, right?
 

3059
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,870
Does it converge to something, right?
Does it work? How do you test? You have

3060
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:06,880
Does it work? How do you test? You have
 

3061
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,430
Does it work? How do you test? You have
validation data. All that stuff is still

3062
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:09,440
validation data. All that stuff is still
 

3063
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,630
validation data. All that stuff is still
available to us.

3064
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:12,640
available to us.
 

3065
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,470
available to us.
Does everyone see that? So for example,

3066
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:14,480
Does everyone see that? So for example,
 

3067
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,669
Does everyone see that? So for example,
here we could hold out entire traces,

3068
01:16:17,669 --> 01:16:17,679
here we could hold out entire traces,
 

3069
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,189
here we could hold out entire traces,
right? We have many traces. We hold out

3070
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:19,199
right? We have many traces. We hold out
 

3071
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,830
right? We have many traces. We hold out
entire traces. We run this and we see

3072
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,840
entire traces. We run this and we see
 

3073
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,709
entire traces. We run this and we see
how well does it do at predicting for

3074
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:24,719
how well does it do at predicting for
 

3075
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:26,390
how well does it do at predicting for
those held out traces. If it's doing a

3076
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:26,400
those held out traces. If it's doing a
 

3077
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,070
those held out traces. If it's doing a
good job, you probably learned

3078
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:28,080
good job, you probably learned
 

3079
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,350
good job, you probably learned
something.

3080
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:31,360

 

3081
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,270

Now the important thing is we just told

3082
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:33,280
Now the important thing is we just told
 

3083
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,030
Now the important thing is we just told
you that what you're kind of spiritually

3084
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:35,040
you that what you're kind of spiritually
 

3085
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,910
you that what you're kind of spiritually
learning here is what is this filter up

3086
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:37,920
learning here is what is this filter up
 

3087
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,590
learning here is what is this filter up
to coordinate transformations

3088
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:41,600
to coordinate transformations
 

3089
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,870
to coordinate transformations
but that means given a few actual golden

3090
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:44,880
but that means given a few actual golden
 

3091
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,510
but that means given a few actual golden
labels that told you what the x's were

3092
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:47,520
labels that told you what the x's were
 

3093
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:53,750
labels that told you what the x's were
for some trace you could probably get it

3094
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760

 

3095
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,590

okay everyone with me so we've talked

3096
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:57,600
okay everyone with me so we've talked
 

3097
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,149
okay everyone with me so we've talked
about it in the RNN context here, but

3098
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:00,159
about it in the RNN context here, but
 

3099
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,590
about it in the RNN context here, but
this should remind you of things that

3100
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:01,600
this should remind you of things that
 

3101
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:06,149
this should remind you of things that
you've seen a little bit before. Okay?

3102
01:17:06,149 --> 01:17:06,159
you've seen a little bit before. Okay?
 

3103
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:10,790
you've seen a little bit before. Okay?
And this is a general principle here

3104
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:10,800
And this is a general principle here
 

3105
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,430
And this is a general principle here
that's called self-s supervision.

3106
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,440
that's called self-s supervision.
 

3107
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,870
that's called self-s supervision.
You might not have seen this principle,

3108
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:14,880
You might not have seen this principle,
 

3109
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,709
You might not have seen this principle,
but you've seen things that it's related

3110
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:16,719
but you've seen things that it's related
 

3111
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,470
but you've seen things that it's related
to.

3112
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:18,480
to.
 

3113
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,669
to.
So the general principle of

3114
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:19,679
So the general principle of
 

3115
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:23,189
So the general principle of
self-supervision goes like this.

3116
01:17:23,189 --> 01:17:23,199
self-supervision goes like this.
 

3117
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:26,229
self-supervision goes like this.
There's a pattern. I think I can learn

3118
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:26,239
There's a pattern. I think I can learn
 

3119
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:29,030
There's a pattern. I think I can learn
some aspect of this pattern.

3120
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:29,040
some aspect of this pattern.
 

3121
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,390
some aspect of this pattern.
I might not be able to run all of it,

3122
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:30,400
I might not be able to run all of it,
 

3123
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,149
I might not be able to run all of it,
but there's something I can learn here

3124
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:32,159
but there's something I can learn here
 

3125
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,709
but there's something I can learn here
in my data.

3126
01:17:34,709 --> 01:17:34,719
in my data.
 

3127
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,470
in my data.
That's a precondition. If there's you

3128
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:36,480
That's a precondition. If there's you
 

3129
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,590
That's a precondition. If there's you
think there's nothing you can learn from

3130
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:37,600
think there's nothing you can learn from
 

3131
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,669
think there's nothing you can learn from
this data, go home. This is a deep

3132
01:17:39,669 --> 01:17:39,679
this data, go home. This is a deep
 

3133
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,030
this data, go home. This is a deep
learning class. There's no learning of

3134
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,040
learning class. There's no learning of
 

3135
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,430
learning class. There's no learning of
something that doesn't matter. Okay? So,

3136
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:43,440
something that doesn't matter. Okay? So,
 

3137
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,630
something that doesn't matter. Okay? So,
you think there's a pattern you can

3138
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:44,640
you think there's a pattern you can
 

3139
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,870
you think there's a pattern you can
learn,

3140
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:46,880
learn,
 

3141
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,550
learn,
but you need labels to train. All your

3142
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:50,560
but you need labels to train. All your
 

3143
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,630
but you need labels to train. All your
pipeline depends on having losses.

3144
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:52,640
pipeline depends on having losses.
 

3145
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,270
pipeline depends on having losses.
Losses are comparisons with some labels.

3146
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:55,280
Losses are comparisons with some labels.
 

3147
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,630
Losses are comparisons with some labels.
So you need something that's like doing

3148
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:56,640
So you need something that's like doing
 

3149
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,310
So you need something that's like doing
the lost job which you think of as like

3150
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:58,320
the lost job which you think of as like
 

3151
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,910
the lost job which you think of as like
labels.

3152
01:17:59,910 --> 01:17:59,920
labels.
 

3153
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,390
labels.
You need labels to train. I don't have

3154
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:02,400
You need labels to train. I don't have
 

3155
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,390
You need labels to train. I don't have
them.

3156
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:04,400
them.
 

3157
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,149
them.
So what do you do? The answer is you

3158
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:08,159
So what do you do? The answer is you
 

3159
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,709
So what do you do? The answer is you
make your own labels from the data.

3160
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:10,719
make your own labels from the data.
 

3161
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,229
make your own labels from the data.
Because there's an underlying pattern,

3162
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:12,239
Because there's an underlying pattern,
 

3163
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:15,110
Because there's an underlying pattern,
you make it in a conscious way of based

3164
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:15,120
you make it in a conscious way of based
 

3165
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,270
you make it in a conscious way of based
on the data you have something that you

3166
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:17,280
on the data you have something that you
 

3167
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,270
on the data you have something that you
can synthesize that can do the job of a

3168
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:19,280
can synthesize that can do the job of a
 

3169
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,270
can synthesize that can do the job of a
label. So you can set up your deep

3170
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:21,280
label. So you can set up your deep
 

3171
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,870
label. So you can set up your deep
learning pipeline. You need something

3172
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:22,880
learning pipeline. You need something
 

3173
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,870
learning pipeline. You need something
you can run into a loss so you can pass

3174
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:24,880
you can run into a loss so you can pass
 

3175
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,709
you can run into a loss so you can pass
gradients.

3176
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:26,719
gradients.
 

3177
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:28,470
gradients.
Okay, this is the idea of self-s

3178
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:28,480
Okay, this is the idea of self-s
 

3179
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,430
Okay, this is the idea of self-s
supervision. It's called self-s

3180
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:29,440
supervision. It's called self-s
 

3181
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:30,790
supervision. It's called self-s
supervision because you don't have

3182
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:30,800
supervision because you don't have
 

3183
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,310
supervision because you don't have
external supervision. So you do it

3184
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:32,320
external supervision. So you do it
 

3185
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,110
external supervision. So you do it
yourself.

3186
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:35,120
yourself.
 

3187
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,750
yourself.
So the example above

3188
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:37,760
So the example above
 

3189
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,950
So the example above
says you know

3190
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:40,960
says you know
 

3191
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,750
says you know
there can be a partial pattern that

3192
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:43,760
there can be a partial pattern that
 

3193
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,270
there can be a partial pattern that
could be useful. In that case we said

3194
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:45,280
could be useful. In that case we said
 

3195
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,470
could be useful. In that case we said
look there's definitely something about

3196
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:46,480
look there's definitely something about
 

3197
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,870
look there's definitely something about
the igen values of this a matrix that we

3198
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:48,880
the igen values of this a matrix that we
 

3199
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,709
the igen values of this a matrix that we
should be able to p pull out. Maybe some

3200
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:50,719
should be able to p pull out. Maybe some
 

3201
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,149
should be able to p pull out. Maybe some
other stuff too, but at least we can

3202
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:52,159
other stuff too, but at least we can
 

3203
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:58,390
other stuff too, but at least we can
pull that something about that out.

3204
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:58,400

 

3205
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,229

Second concept is you might need some

3206
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:00,239
Second concept is you might need some
 

3207
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,470
Second concept is you might need some
scaffolding. So I put it in yellow

3208
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:02,480
scaffolding. So I put it in yellow
 

3209
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,030
scaffolding. So I put it in yellow
because this linear layer that we built

3210
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:05,040
because this linear layer that we built
 

3211
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,990
because this linear layer that we built
here for prediction was just

3212
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:08,000
here for prediction was just
 

3213
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,669
here for prediction was just
scaffolding.

3214
01:19:09,669 --> 01:19:09,679
scaffolding.
 

3215
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:11,910
scaffolding.
It's not the thing we wanted to learn.

3216
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:11,920
It's not the thing we wanted to learn.
 

3217
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,470
It's not the thing we wanted to learn.
It's structures that are present to help

3218
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:14,480
It's structures that are present to help
 

3219
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,149
It's structures that are present to help
us learn the thing we wanted to learn.

3220
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:16,159
us learn the thing we wanted to learn.
 

3221
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,590
us learn the thing we wanted to learn.
So the way you build buildings, you

3222
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:17,600
So the way you build buildings, you
 

3223
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,510
So the way you build buildings, you
build scaffolding around them and then

3224
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:19,520
build scaffolding around them and then
 

3225
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,950
build scaffolding around them and then
at the end you don't care about the

3226
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:20,960
at the end you don't care about the
 

3227
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,470
at the end you don't care about the
scaffolding. The scaffolding can go away

3228
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:22,480
scaffolding. The scaffolding can go away
 

3229
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:25,430
scaffolding. The scaffolding can go away
but the building remains. So in doing

3230
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:25,440
but the building remains. So in doing
 

3231
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,870
but the building remains. So in doing
this kind of self-supervision you might

3232
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:26,880
this kind of self-supervision you might
 

3233
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,950
this kind of self-supervision you might
need scaffolding. This example already

3234
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:28,960
need scaffolding. This example already
 

3235
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,830
need scaffolding. This example already
shows it.

3236
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:31,840
shows it.
 

3237
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,390
shows it.
And in this particular case, when you

3238
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:34,400
And in this particular case, when you
 

3239
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:38,070
And in this particular case, when you
have things that are causal sequences,

3240
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:38,080
have things that are causal sequences,
 

3241
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,390
have things that are causal sequences,
one way of having the thing you want to

3242
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:40,400
one way of having the thing you want to
 

3243
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,750
one way of having the thing you want to
predict, the target, if you want to

3244
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:41,760
predict, the target, if you want to
 

3245
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,229
predict, the target, if you want to
learn a causal pattern, the natural

3246
01:19:44,229 --> 01:19:44,239
learn a causal pattern, the natural
 

3247
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:46,630
learn a causal pattern, the natural
thing to try to predict is the next

3248
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:46,640
thing to try to predict is the next
 

3249
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,270
thing to try to predict is the next
thing because the next thing depends on

3250
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:49,280
thing because the next thing depends on
 

3251
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,390
thing because the next thing depends on
the previous stuff.

3252
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:52,400
the previous stuff.
 

3253
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,550
the previous stuff.
Okay? So, it's like a generic choice.

3254
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:54,560
Okay? So, it's like a generic choice.
 

3255
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,709
Okay? So, it's like a generic choice.
Predict something about the next thing.

3256
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:56,719
Predict something about the next thing.
 

3257
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,310
Predict something about the next thing.
In this case, it required some kind of

3258
01:19:58,310 --> 01:19:58,320
In this case, it required some kind of
 

3259
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,750
In this case, it required some kind of
conscious thought because you said the

3260
01:19:59,750 --> 01:19:59,760
conscious thought because you said the
 

3261
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,110
conscious thought because you said the
next thing that I want to predict is the

3262
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:01,120
next thing that I want to predict is the
 

3263
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,350
next thing that I want to predict is the
Y, not the U, because they have

3264
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,360
Y, not the U, because they have
 

3265
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,189
Y, not the U, because they have
different characters in this problem.

3266
01:20:05,189 --> 01:20:05,199
different characters in this problem.
 

3267
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:06,790
different characters in this problem.
One is an input and one is an output.

3268
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:06,800
One is an input and one is an output.
 

3269
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,149
One is an input and one is an output.
You know that the causal connection is

3270
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:08,159
You know that the causal connection is
 

3271
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:09,350
You know that the causal connection is
one way. So you predict the thing that's

3272
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,360
one way. So you predict the thing that's
 

3273
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,189
one way. So you predict the thing that's
causally dependent, not the thing that's

3274
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:11,199
causally dependent, not the thing that's
 

3275
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,189
causally dependent, not the thing that's
independent.

3276
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:13,199
independent.
 

3277
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:16,950
independent.
>> Yeah.

3278
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:16,960

 

3279
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,229

>> So this linear layer we put here for

3280
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:20,239
>> So this linear layer we put here for
 

3281
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,149
>> So this linear layer we put here for
training, it has learnable parameters in

it.
Those will be learned. We don't care

3286
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:25,840
Those will be learned. We don't care
 

3287
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,790
Those will be learned. We don't care
about their values.

3288
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:28,800
about their values.
 

3289
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,070
about their values.
That's not the pattern we're trying to

3290
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:30,080
That's not the pattern we're trying to
 

3291
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,830
That's not the pattern we're trying to
get at. The pattern we're trying to get

3292
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:31,840
get at. The pattern we're trying to get
 

3293
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,189
get at. The pattern we're trying to get
at is what's happening in the dynamics

3294
01:20:33,189 --> 01:20:33,199
at is what's happening in the dynamics

But we can't train without that linear

Right? The y is five dimensional. Our

01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:48,880
Right? The y is five dimensional. Our
 

3309
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,750
Right? The y is five dimensional. Our
state is two. I have to I'm taking a

state is two. I have to I'm taking a
 

3311
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,350
state is two. I have to I'm taking a
loss against a fivedimensional thing. I

3312
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:53,360
loss against a fivedimensional thing. I
 

3313
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,990
loss against a fivedimensional thing. I
have to have a fivedimensional thing. I

have to have a fivedimensional thing. I

So I need additional structure.

So I need additional structure.

01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,590
So I need additional structure.
So this will happen in many uh cases

So this will happen in many uh cases
 

3321

that we talk about. Yeah.
 

3323
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:09,430
that we talk about. Yeah.

we're looking at some sort of sequence
 

3331
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,870
we're looking at some sort of sequence

01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,390
but in imaging for instance you could
have that sort of hidden like lat trying

have that sort of hidden like lat trying
 

3335

3371
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,149

Okay. So

3376
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:02,080
Okay. So
 

3377
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,790
Okay. So
what I wanted to connect to next is to

3378
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:04,800
what I wanted to connect to next is to
 

3379
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,229
what I wanted to connect to next is to
say look all of this

3380
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:08,239
say look all of this
 

3381
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,629

a pattern you want to learn this is like

3384
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:13,120
a pattern you want to learn this is like
 

3385
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,189
a pattern you want to learn this is like
unsupervised learning in classical ML

3386
01:22:17,189 --> 01:22:17,199
unsupervised learning in classical ML
 

3387
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,030
unsupervised learning in classical ML
and so we mentioned at the very

3388
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:19,040
and so we mentioned at the very
 

3389
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,310
and so we mentioned at the very
beginning we'll be talking about this

3390
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:20,320
beginning we'll be talking about this
 

3391
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,709
beginning we'll be talking about this
unsupervised learning stuff so so far

3392
01:22:22,709 --> 01:22:22,719
unsupervised learning stuff so so far
 

3393
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,149
unsupervised learning stuff so so far
we've already introduced it a little bit

3394
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:24,159
we've already introduced it a little bit
 

3395
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:25,750
we've already introduced it a little bit
we're talking about this pooling idea

3396
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:25,760
we're talking about this pooling idea
 

3397
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,870
we're talking about this pooling idea
but now we're kind of going to get into

3398
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:26,880
but now we're kind of going to get into
 

3399
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,750
but now we're kind of going to get into
it a little bit more so how can we make

3400
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:29,760
it a little bit more so how can we make
 

3401
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,470
it a little bit more so how can we make
this conction

3402
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:32,480

 

3403
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,149

And

3404
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:34,159
And
 

3405
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,470
And
you have to remember that there's

3406
01:22:36,470 --> 01:22:36,480
you have to remember that there's
 

3407
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,550
you have to remember that there's
basically two approaches you learned in

3408
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:38,560
basically two approaches you learned in
 

3409
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,390
basically two approaches you learned in
classic ML dimensional reduction

3410
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:42,400
classic ML dimensional reduction
 

3411
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,350
classic ML dimensional reduction
and clustering. Both of them were about

3412
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:45,360
and clustering. Both of them were about
 

3413
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,110
and clustering. Both of them were about
figuring out the kind of structure

3414
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:47,120
figuring out the kind of structure
 

3415
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,189
figuring out the kind of structure
that's intrinsic in your data. Just

3416
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:49,199
that's intrinsic in your data. Just
 

3417
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:50,709
that's intrinsic in your data. Just
different kinds of structure.

3418
01:22:50,709 --> 01:22:50,719
different kinds of structure.
 

3419
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:52,629
different kinds of structure.
Dimensionality reduction was saying look

3420
01:22:52,629 --> 01:22:52,639
Dimensionality reduction was saying look
 

3421
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,030
Dimensionality reduction was saying look
in my data there's certain dimensions of

3422
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:55,040
in my data there's certain dimensions of
 

3423
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,990
in my data there's certain dimensions of
regularity that where the action is and

3424
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:58,000
regularity that where the action is and
 

3425
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,709
regularity that where the action is and
others that are less variable.

3426
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:00,719
others that are less variable.
 

3427
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:02,629
others that are less variable.
And in clustering it was that my data

3428
01:23:02,629 --> 01:23:02,639
And in clustering it was that my data
 

3429
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:05,430
And in clustering it was that my data
isn't sort of uniformly distributed. So

3430
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:05,440
isn't sort of uniformly distributed. So
 

3431
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,709
isn't sort of uniformly distributed. So
you think of dimensionality reduction is

3432
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:06,719
you think of dimensionality reduction is
 

3433
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:08,229
you think of dimensionality reduction is
my data isn't uniformly distributed.

3434
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:08,239
my data isn't uniformly distributed.
 

3435
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,950
my data isn't uniformly distributed.
It's on a thinner thing.

3436
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:10,960
It's on a thinner thing.
 

3437
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,950
It's on a thinner thing.
Clustering is my data isn't uniformly

3438
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:12,960
Clustering is my data isn't uniformly
 

3439
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,270
Clustering is my data isn't uniformly
distributed. It's in blobs.

3440
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:17,280

 

3441
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,149

Okay. Two different perspectives on the

3442
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:20,159
Okay. Two different perspectives on the
 

3443
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:24,390
Okay. Two different perspectives on the
kinds of patterns you want to get.

3444
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:24,400

 

3445
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,870

So

3446
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:26,880
So
 

3447
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,550
So
I will not be able to talk about

3448
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:28,560
I will not be able to talk about
 

3449
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,550
I will not be able to talk about
everything. So I will just like maybe

3450
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:30,560
everything. So I will just like maybe
 

3451
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,990
everything. So I will just like maybe
start a little bit and we'll have to re

3452
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:32,000
start a little bit and we'll have to re
 

3453
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,229
start a little bit and we'll have to re
we'll have to continue. Um

3454
01:23:36,229 --> 01:23:36,239
we'll have to continue. Um
 

3455
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:39,189
we'll have to continue. Um
if you think about like PCA

3456
01:23:39,189 --> 01:23:39,199
if you think about like PCA
 

3457
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:41,350
if you think about like PCA
that's the algorithm you learned for

3458
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:41,360
that's the algorithm you learned for
 

3459
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,669
that's the algorithm you learned for
dimensionality reduction

3460
01:23:43,669 --> 01:23:43,679
dimensionality reduction
 

3461
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:47,030
dimensionality reduction
you have these XI just X's

3462
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:47,040
you have these XI just X's
 

3463
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,629
you have these XI just X's
they're unlabeled data from some

3464
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:48,639
they're unlabeled data from some
 

3465
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,149
they're unlabeled data from some
interesting distribution in particular

3466
01:23:50,149 --> 01:23:50,159
interesting distribution in particular
 

3467
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:53,590
interesting distribution in particular
from a PCA point of view it's thin

3468
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:53,600
from a PCA point of view it's thin
 

3469
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,149
from a PCA point of view it's thin
it's not covering everything equally

3470
01:23:56,149 --> 01:23:56,159
it's not covering everything equally
 

3471
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:57,590
it's not covering everything equally
some area some directions are more

3472
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:57,600
some area some directions are more
 

3473
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,149
some area some directions are more
represented than others so the classic

3474
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:00,159
represented than others so the classic
 

3475
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,629
represented than others so the classic
recipe you learned which is not have the

3476
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
recipe you learned which is not have the
 

3477
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:04,950
recipe you learned which is not have the
form of loss function was you

3478
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:04,960
form of loss function was you
 

3479
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,149
form of loss function was you
constructed an X matrix of all the data

3480
01:24:08,149 --> 01:24:08,159
constructed an X matrix of all the data
 

3481
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:10,790
constructed an X matrix of all the data
then I'm going to ignore the mean parts

3482
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:10,800
then I'm going to ignore the mean parts
 

3483
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,669
then I'm going to ignore the mean parts
you computed it SVD

3484
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:13,679
you computed it SVD
 

3485
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,310
you computed it SVD
you said I'm going to keep the large top

3486
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:16,320
you said I'm going to keep the large top
 

3487
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,550
you said I'm going to keep the large top
singular vectors

3488
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:18,560
singular vectors
 

3489
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,750
singular vectors
and that's how you do dimensionality

3490
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:19,760
and that's how you do dimensionality
 

3491
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:24,149
and that's how you do dimensionality
reduction everyone remember this

3492
01:24:24,149 --> 01:24:24,159
reduction everyone remember this
 

3493
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,310
reduction everyone remember this
so

3494
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:26,320
so
 

3495
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,070
so
if you're given some other problem how

3496
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:28,080
if you're given some other problem how
 

3497
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,350
if you're given some other problem how
do you actually do dimensionality

3498
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:29,360
do you actually do dimensionality
 

3499
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,149
do you actually do dimensionality
reduction some other problem not this

3500
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:32,159
reduction some other problem not this
 

3501
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,229
reduction some other problem not this
unlabelled data some other problem you

3502
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:34,239
unlabelled data some other problem you
 

3503
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:37,350
unlabelled data some other problem you
have a new X what you do is you extract

3504
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:37,360
have a new X what you do is you extract
 

3505
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,430
have a new X what you do is you extract
the features from it by doing

3506
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:39,440
the features from it by doing
 

3507
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,149
the features from it by doing
projections onto the V's the top V's

3508
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:42,159
projections onto the V's the top V's
 

3509
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,189
projections onto the V's the top V's
that's how you actually do the

3510
01:24:43,189 --> 01:24:43,199
that's how you actually do the
 

3511
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:44,950
that's how you actually do the
dimensional reduction so you started off

3512
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:44,960
dimensional reduction so you started off
 

3513
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,870
dimensional reduction so you started off
with some X which is large dimension and

3514
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:46,880
with some X which is large dimension and
 

3515
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,430
with some X which is large dimension and
you end up with K dimensional things and

3516
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:49,440
you end up with K dimensional things and
 

3517
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,270
you end up with K dimensional things and
you use that for your learning problem

3518
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:51,280
you use that for your learning problem
 

3519
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,669
you use that for your learning problem
everyone remember this

3520
01:24:53,669 --> 01:24:53,679
everyone remember this
 

3521
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:57,110
everyone remember this
so the question is can we think about

3522
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:57,120
so the question is can we think about
 

3523
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:01,110
so the question is can we think about
this as self-s supervision

3524
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,120

 

3525
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:06,070

Okay, here there is no gradients,

3526
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:06,080
Okay, here there is no gradients,
 

3527
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,470
Okay, here there is no gradients,
there's no labels and there's no

3528
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:08,480
there's no labels and there's no
 

3529
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,550
there's no labels and there's no
supervision.

3530
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:10,560
supervision.
 

3531
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,870
supervision.
Everyone see that? We want to say is

3532
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:12,880
Everyone see that? We want to say is
 

3533
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,550
Everyone see that? We want to say is
there a way of understanding what we did

3534
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:14,560
there a way of understanding what we did
 

3535
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,430
there a way of understanding what we did
here in terms of a loss

3536
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:17,440
here in terms of a loss
 

3537
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,870
here in terms of a loss
that we could train using gradient

3538
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:18,880
that we could train using gradient
 

3539
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,709
that we could train using gradient
descent

3540
01:25:20,709 --> 01:25:20,719
descent
 

3541
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:21,990
descent
where none of the ingredients are

3542
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:22,000
where none of the ingredients are
 

3543
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,870
where none of the ingredients are
present. Okay.

3544
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:24,880
present. Okay.
 

3545
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,709
present. Okay.
And the answer is yes

3546
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:28,719

 

3547
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:32,470

because of this.

3548
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:32,480

 

3549
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,470

So the justification you saw so you

3550
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,480
So the justification you saw so you
 

3551
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,070
So the justification you saw so you
might have seen PCA justified by it

3552
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:36,080
might have seen PCA justified by it
 

3553
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,510
might have seen PCA justified by it
works totally fine. Um you might have

3554
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:39,520
works totally fine. Um you might have
 

3555
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,430
works totally fine. Um you might have
also seen it justified by the echerty

3556
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:41,440
also seen it justified by the echerty
 

3557
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,229
also seen it justified by the echerty
young mirki theorem for forbinius norm

okay which is that given a matrix x if

3560
01:25:48,229 --> 01:25:48,239
okay which is that given a matrix x if
 

3561
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,149
okay which is that given a matrix x if
you look at the best rank k

3562
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:50,159
you look at the best rank k
 

3563
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,669
you look at the best rank k
approximation it's going to come from

3564
01:25:51,669 --> 01:25:51,679
approximation it's going to come from
 

3565
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,430
approximation it's going to come from
looking at the top k singular vectors

3566
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:53,440
looking at the top k singular vectors
 

3567
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,189
looking at the top k singular vectors
and singular values and just keeping

3568
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:55,199
and singular values and just keeping
 

3569
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:58,149
and singular values and just keeping
them and that's the best in the sense of

3570
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
them and that's the best in the sense of
 

3571
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,310
them and that's the best in the sense of
minimizing the difference between this

3572
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:00,320
minimizing the difference between this
 

3573
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,950
minimizing the difference between this
rank k thing and x in forbinius norm

3574
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:02,960

squared or forbinous norm doesn't matter

3576
01:26:06,149 --> 01:26:06,159
squared or forbinous norm doesn't matter
 

3577
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:07,910
squared or forbinous norm doesn't matter
if you see an optimization class You

3578
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:07,920
if you see an optimization class You
 

3579
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,430
if you see an optimization class You
might have seen this in two different

3580
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:09,440
might have seen this in two different
 

3581
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,590
might have seen this in two different
norms in Fbinius norm and in spectral

3582
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:11,600
norms in Fbinius norm and in spectral
 

3583
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,149
norms in Fbinius norm and in spectral
norm here forbinius norm is the one

3584
01:26:14,149 --> 01:26:14,159
norm here forbinius norm is the one
 

3585
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:16,070
norm here forbinius norm is the one
that's more useful for us because it's

3586
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:16,080
that's more useful for us because it's
 

3587
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,550
that's more useful for us because it's
going to treat every row as a vector.

3588
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:18,560
going to treat every row as a vector.
 

3589
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,430
going to treat every row as a vector.
Okay, that will give us a loss. Then we

3590
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:21,440
Okay, that will give us a loss. Then we
 

3591
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,590
Okay, that will give us a loss. Then we
can interpret what PCA is doing as

3592
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:23,600
can interpret what PCA is doing as
 

3593
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,830
can interpret what PCA is doing as
self-supervision.

3594
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:25,840
self-supervision.
 

3595
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:26,790
self-supervision.
This will then connect us to

3596
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:26,800
This will then connect us to
 

3597
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,470
This will then connect us to
autoenccoders

3598
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:28,480
autoenccoders
 

3599
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,910
autoenccoders
which is useful. Okay, that's the next

3600
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:31,920
which is useful. Okay, that's the next
 

3601
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,430
which is useful. Okay, that's the next
part of the class. I was too ambitious

3602
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:33,440
part of the class. I was too ambitious
 

3603
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,189
part of the class. I was too ambitious
in what I thought I could cover in in

3604
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:35,199
in what I thought I could cover in in
 

3605
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:37,350
in what I thought I could cover in in
one lecture. But that's the next little

3606
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:37,360
one lecture. But that's the next little
 

3607
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,110
one lecture. But that's the next little
segment before we then go back to this

3608
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:39,120
segment before we then go back to this
 

3609
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,390
segment before we then go back to this

3611
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,910

here about we can learn things up to

3612
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:43,920
here about we can learn things up to
 

3613
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,350
here about we can learn things up to
IGEN values maybe we can think about

3614
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:45,360
IGEN values maybe we can think about
 

3615
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,669
IGEN values maybe we can think about
that how to make better

3616
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:47,679
that how to make better
 

3617
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:50,629
that how to make better
uh recurrent networks. Okay all these
