we moved it
 

75
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,950
we moved it
again. We encourage people to come take

82
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
office hours.
 

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,350
office hours.
>> There are some people who are scared to

84
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
>> There are some people who are scared to
 

85
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,270
>> There are some people who are scared to
come into office hours.

86
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
come into office hours.
 

87
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,590
come into office hours.
>> Yeah. Good. You should come. Should

88
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
>> Yeah. Good. You should come. Should
 

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,550
>> Yeah. Good. You should come. Should
come. Yeah. Um, you need to learn the

90
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
come. Yeah. Um, you need to learn the
 

91
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,350
come. Yeah. Um, you need to learn the
material. Uh, asking questions is a good

92
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
material. Uh, asking questions is a good
 

93
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,310
material. Uh, asking questions is a good
way. Coming to office hours prepared to

94
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
way. Coming to office hours prepared to
 

95
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,230
way. Coming to office hours prepared to
ask questions is a good way to get

96
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
ask questions is a good way to get
 

97
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,030
ask questions is a good way to get
yourself ready.

98
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,040
yourself ready.
 

99
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,150
yourself ready.
>> Office hours. Sit there and do your

100
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
>> Office hours. Sit there and do your
 

101
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,270
>> Office hours. Sit there and do your
homework.

102
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
homework.
 

103
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,270
homework.
>> Yeah.

104
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
>> Yeah.
 

105
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,550
>> Yeah.
Yeah. You have to do homework sometime.

106
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
Yeah. You have to do homework sometime.
 

107
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,310
Yeah. You have to do homework sometime.
Might as well do it then. Um, okay. So,

108
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
Might as well do it then. Um, okay. So,
 

109
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,029
Might as well do it then. Um, okay. So,
we're going to continue. So, uh,

110
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
we're going to continue. So, uh,
 

111
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,070
we're going to continue. So, uh,
everyone recalls the setting. Um, I'm

112
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
everyone recalls the setting. Um, I'm
 

113
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,510
everyone recalls the setting. Um, I'm
going to skip this thing that we did

114
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
going to skip this thing that we did
 

115
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,870
going to skip this thing that we did
last time about normalization layers and

116
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
last time about normalization layers and
 

117
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,469
last time about normalization layers and
continue talking about residual and skip

118
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
continue talking about residual and skip
 

119
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,830
continue talking about residual and skip
connections. We went a little fast. So,

120
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
connections. We went a little fast. So,
 

121
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,870
connections. We went a little fast. So,
I'll just quickly recap where we were.

122
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
I'll just quickly recap where we were.
 

123
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,469
I'll just quickly recap where we were.
So, people saw that networks were doing

124
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
So, people saw that networks were doing
 

125
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,830
So, people saw that networks were doing
neural network was doing quite well.

126
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
neural network was doing quite well.
 

127
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,670
neural network was doing quite well.
They saw that making them bigger made

128
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
They saw that making them bigger made
 

129
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,070
They saw that making them bigger made
them work better and they tried to make

130
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
them work better and they tried to make
 

131
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,070
them work better and they tried to make
them even bigger and then they observed

132
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
them even bigger and then they observed
 

133
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,990
them even bigger and then they observed
this odd phenomena. Although they were

134
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
this odd phenomena. Although they were
 

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,950
this odd phenomena. Although they were
adding parameters, they found that the

136
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
adding parameters, they found that the
 

137
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,110
adding parameters, they found that the
larger network was performing worse

138
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
larger network was performing worse
 

139
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,749
larger network was performing worse
uh and in training as well as in

140
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
uh and in training as well as in
 

141
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,990
uh and in training as well as in
testing. And this would

142
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
testing. And this would
 

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,430
testing. And this would
>> mic.

144
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440

 

145
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,270

Let's see if this works better. Is that

146
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
Let's see if this works better. Is that
 

147
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,110
Let's see if this works better. Is that
okay? Uh so you normally

148
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
okay? Uh so you normally
 

149
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,870
okay? Uh so you normally
think of a phenomena like this as being

150
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
think of a phenomena like this as being
 

151
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,629
think of a phenomena like this as being
an underfitting phenomena because you're

152
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
an underfitting phenomena because you're
 

153
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,070
an underfitting phenomena because you're
doing bad and you're doing worse in

154
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
doing bad and you're doing worse in
 

155
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,189
doing bad and you're doing worse in
training but it was odd from the ML

156
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
training but it was odd from the ML
 

157
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,189
training but it was odd from the ML
community's point of view because you're

158
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
community's point of view because you're
 

159
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,270
community's point of view because you're
making the model bigger and it's

160
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
making the model bigger and it's
 

161
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,550
making the model bigger and it's
underfitting. So what was going on? They

162
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
underfitting. So what was going on? They
 

163
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,270
underfitting. So what was going on? They
said okay it's probably uh not training

164
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
said okay it's probably uh not training
 

165
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,990
said okay it's probably uh not training
very well. And so this the idea was

166
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
very well. And so this the idea was
 

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,590
very well. And so this the idea was
somehow the gradients as they're going

168
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
somehow the gradients as they're going
 

169
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,510
somehow the gradients as they're going
backwards are either diminishing or

170
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
backwards are either diminishing or
 

171
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,950
backwards are either diminishing or
becoming garbled and less informative.

172
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
becoming garbled and less informative.
 

173
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,350
becoming garbled and less informative.
And the idea was wouldn't it be great if

174
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
And the idea was wouldn't it be great if
 

175
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,710
And the idea was wouldn't it be great if
we could somehow create a gradient

176
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
we could somehow create a gradient
 

177
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,230
we could somehow create a gradient
superighway.

178
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
superighway.
 

179
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,230
superighway.
Some way of having the gradients come

180
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
Some way of having the gradients come
 

181
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,110
Some way of having the gradients come
from the later layers back to earlier

182
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
from the later layers back to earlier
 

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,350
from the later layers back to earlier
layers uh in a way that the earlier

184
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
layers uh in a way that the earlier
 

185
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,029
layers uh in a way that the earlier
layers could contribute without having

186
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
layers could contribute without having
 

187
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,029
layers could contribute without having
it get garbled by intermediate layers.

188
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
it get garbled by intermediate layers.
 

189
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,110
it get garbled by intermediate layers.
And so the first idea one might have of

190
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
And so the first idea one might have of
 

191
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,350
And so the first idea one might have of
basically adding links in the so

192
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
basically adding links in the so
 

193
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,189
basically adding links in the so
remember the gradients follow the path

194
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
remember the gradients follow the path
 

195
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,870
remember the gradients follow the path
of the forward network. So if you want

196
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
of the forward network. So if you want
 

197
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,550
of the forward network. So if you want
to add a path for gradients you have to

198
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
to add a path for gradients you have to
 

199
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,270
to add a path for gradients you have to
add paths in the forward network. So

200
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
add paths in the forward network. So
 

201
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,029
add paths in the forward network. So
from this point of view the idea was

202
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
from this point of view the idea was
 

203
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,710
from this point of view the idea was
well I could add lots of paths from

204
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
well I could add lots of paths from
 

205
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,589
well I could add lots of paths from
everybody to here

206
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599
everybody to here
 

207
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,029
everybody to here
and then I could do the same thing to

208
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
and then I could do the same thing to
 

209
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,790
and then I could do the same thing to
every other position intermediate and

210
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
every other position intermediate and
 

211
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,550
every other position intermediate and
that doesn't work because the

212
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
that doesn't work because the
 

213
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,870
that doesn't work because the
activations get really big. So

214
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
activations get really big. So
 

215
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,469
activations get really big. So
the question was what's the minimal

216
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
the question was what's the minimal
 

217
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,070
the question was what's the minimal
thing you need to do to get gradients to

218
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,080
thing you need to do to get gradients to
 

219
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,270
thing you need to do to get gradients to
go everywhere and the idea was these

220
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
go everywhere and the idea was these
 

221
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,270
go everywhere and the idea was these
skip connections. So the skip

222
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
skip connections. So the skip
 

223
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,110
skip connections. So the skip
connections do is they add the input to

224
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
connections do is they add the input to
 

225
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,350
connections do is they add the input to
the output of a layer where now we're

226
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
the output of a layer where now we're
 

227
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,350
the output of a layer where now we're
going to think of a layer now in a more

228
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
going to think of a layer now in a more
 

229
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,629
going to think of a layer now in a more
flexible way as a block. The block is

230
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
flexible way as a block. The block is
 

231
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,189
flexible way as a block. The block is
now the thing that gets skipped.

232
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
now the thing that gets skipped.
 

233
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,790
now the thing that gets skipped.
Everyone with me? Before we thought

234
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
Everyone with me? Before we thought
 

235
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,350
Everyone with me? Before we thought
about a layer as being some weights,

236
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
about a layer as being some weights,
 

237
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,950
about a layer as being some weights,
some bias and then some nonlinearity

238
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:50,960
some bias and then some nonlinearity
 

239
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,189
some bias and then some nonlinearity
possibly, maybe not a nonlinearity.

240
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
possibly, maybe not a nonlinearity.
 

241
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,189
possibly, maybe not a nonlinearity.
Maybe a normalization comes in as a

242
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
Maybe a normalization comes in as a
 

243
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,510
Maybe a normalization comes in as a
layer. So now we're going to abstract up

244
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
layer. So now we're going to abstract up
 

245
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,390
layer. So now we're going to abstract up
to boxes and in the boxes are going to

246
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
to boxes and in the boxes are going to
 

247
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,150
to boxes and in the boxes are going to
be things like weights and biases and

248
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
be things like weights and biases and
 

249
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,830
be things like weights and biases and
nonlinearities.

250
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
nonlinearities.
 

251
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,150
nonlinearities.
So we have to decide what goes in the

252
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
So we have to decide what goes in the
 

253
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,749
So we have to decide what goes in the
boxes. But the idea behind the skip

254
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
boxes. But the idea behind the skip
 

255
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,589
boxes. But the idea behind the skip
connections is by adding these paths the

256
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
connections is by adding these paths the
 

257
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,990
connections is by adding these paths the
gradients will always remember a plus

258
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
gradients will always remember a plus
 

259
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,469
gradients will always remember a plus
splits the gradient in backrop the same

260
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
splits the gradient in backrop the same
 

261
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,070
splits the gradient in backrop the same
thing goes on both both sides of the

262
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
thing goes on both both sides of the
 

263
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,230
thing goes on both both sides of the
plus. So the gradient coming back

264
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
plus. So the gradient coming back
 

265
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,550
plus. So the gradient coming back
through the output layer will not only

266
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
through the output layer will not only
 

267
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,790
through the output layer will not only
go into this box and then continue on

268
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
go into this box and then continue on
 

269
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,830
go into this box and then continue on
here it will also just go over this plus

270
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
here it will also just go over this plus
 

271
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,629
here it will also just go over this plus
and then enter here. But by that token,

272
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
and then enter here. But by that token,
 

273
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,190
and then enter here. But by that token,
it'll also do this

274
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200

 

275
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,630

back to everywhere any the gradient from

276
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
back to everywhere any the gradient from
 

277
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,909
back to everywhere any the gradient from
the last thing goes back to everybody

278
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
the last thing goes back to everybody
 

279
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,230
the last thing goes back to everybody
else. And by the same logic, the

280
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
else. And by the same logic, the
 

281
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,470
else. And by the same logic, the
gradient that's coming through this

282
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
gradient that's coming through this
 

283
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,190
gradient that's coming through this
penultimate layer is also going back to

284
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
penultimate layer is also going back to
 

285
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,030
penultimate layer is also going back to
everybody.

286
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
everybody.
 

287
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,710
everybody.
So every previous layer box sees

288
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
So every previous layer box sees
 

289
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,150
So every previous layer box sees
gradients coming from every future thing

290
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
gradients coming from every future thing
 

291
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,829
gradients coming from every future thing
in this picture. That's the idea.

292
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
in this picture. That's the idea.
 

293
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,430
in this picture. That's the idea.
Everyone cool with the idea?

294
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
Everyone cool with the idea?
 

295
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,310
Everyone cool with the idea?
Okay. So now what we're going to do is

296
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
Okay. So now what we're going to do is
 

297
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,550
Okay. So now what we're going to do is
we're going to talk about what goes

298
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
we're going to talk about what goes
 

299
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,949
we're going to talk about what goes
inside that box, that block that gets

300
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
inside that box, that block that gets
 

301
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,630
inside that box, that block that gets
skipped over.

302
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640

 

303
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,870

So here it's interesting. So if you go

304
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
So here it's interesting. So if you go
 

305
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,509
So here it's interesting. So if you go
back and read the earlier papers and

306
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
back and read the earlier papers and
 

307
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,030
back and read the earlier papers and
then you look at what people are doing

308
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
then you look at what people are doing
 

309
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,430
then you look at what people are doing
today, you'll see a difference. So I

310
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
today, you'll see a difference. So I
 

311
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,750
today, you'll see a difference. So I
want to acknowledge that and I want to

312
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
want to acknowledge that and I want to
 

313
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,110
want to acknowledge that and I want to
give you the old perspective

314
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
give you the old perspective
 

315
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,910
give you the old perspective
and then the more current perspective on

316
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
and then the more current perspective on
 

317
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,310
and then the more current perspective on
this. Everything now follows generally

318
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
this. Everything now follows generally
 

319
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,070
this. Everything now follows generally
the more current perspective.

320
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080

 

321
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,310

So the old perspective was that what you

322
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
So the old perspective was that what you
 

323
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,630
So the old perspective was that what you
do is

324
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
do is
 

325
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,230
do is
and they found it curious was that you

326
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
and they found it curious was that you
 

327
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,990
and they found it curious was that you
take

328
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
take
 

329
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,630
take
two layers

330
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
two layers
 

331
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,870
two layers
Okay, where a layer is the minimum kind

332
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
Okay, where a layer is the minimum kind
 

333
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,710
Okay, where a layer is the minimum kind
of component of a layer is there's some

334
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
of component of a layer is there's some
 

335
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,790
of component of a layer is there's some
weights, there's a bias and there's a

336
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
weights, there's a bias and there's a
 

337
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,310
weights, there's a bias and there's a
nonlinearity,

338
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
nonlinearity,
 

339
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,470
nonlinearity,
but you take two of the layers and you

340
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
but you take two of the layers and you
 

341
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,509
but you take two of the layers and you
put them inside of a box.

342
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
put them inside of a box.
 

343
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,790
put them inside of a box.
Okay, so there are even papers written

344
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
Okay, so there are even papers written
 

345
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,230
Okay, so there are even papers written
about this where the people are

346
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
about this where the people are
 

347
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,550
about this where the people are
wondering, wait, why doesn't it work

348
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
wondering, wait, why doesn't it work
 

349
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,949
wondering, wait, why doesn't it work
when I just put one, put the skip over

350
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
when I just put one, put the skip over
 

351
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,590
when I just put one, put the skip over
one? Why do I have to do two? Okay, so

352
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
one? Why do I have to do two? Okay, so
 

353
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,269
one? Why do I have to do two? Okay, so
people tried everything and they said

354
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
people tried everything and they said
 

355
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,550
people tried everything and they said
that, you know, two, I need at least

356
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
that, you know, two, I need at least
 

357
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,509
that, you know, two, I need at least
two. I could put three but two I need at

358
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
two. I could put three but two I need at
 

359
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,350
two. I could put three but two I need at
least two for it to work with just one

360
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
least two for it to work with just one
 

361
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,230
least two for it to work with just one
it didn't work right

362
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
it didn't work right
 

363
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,670
it didn't work right
so uh now again when I talk about this

364
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
so uh now again when I talk about this
 

365
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,110
so uh now again when I talk about this
layer when I when I write a weight

366
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
layer when I when I write a weight
 

367
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,670
layer when I when I write a weight
matrix W you should interpret it as

368
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
matrix W you should interpret it as
 

369
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,110
matrix W you should interpret it as
either this is like an MLP we just have

370
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
either this is like an MLP we just have
 

371
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,069
either this is like an MLP we just have
a weight matrix a dense weight matrix or

372
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
a weight matrix a dense weight matrix or
 

373
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,550
a weight matrix a dense weight matrix or
it's like a conflict both of these are

374
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
it's like a conflict both of these are
 

375
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,230
it's like a conflict both of these are
like weights so I'm going to treat these

376
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
like weights so I'm going to treat these
 

377
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,590
like weights so I'm going to treat these
interchangeably from the perspective

378
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
interchangeably from the perspective
 

379
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,470
interchangeably from the perspective
disc of discussions of uh resonance

380
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480

 

381
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,829

Okay, so this is the again the uh the

382
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
Okay, so this is the again the uh the
 

383
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,509
Okay, so this is the again the uh the
old perspective when you just think

384
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
old perspective when you just think
 

385
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,710
old perspective when you just think
about uh the core building blocks, but

386
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
about uh the core building blocks, but
 

387
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,590
about uh the core building blocks, but
we said wait, we talked about

388
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
we said wait, we talked about
 

389
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,030
we said wait, we talked about
normalization layers. How do

390
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
normalization layers. How do
 

391
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,350
normalization layers. How do
normalization layers interact with these

392
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
normalization layers interact with these
 

393
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,350
normalization layers interact with these
residual connections and the blocks?

394
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
residual connections and the blocks?
 

395
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,550
residual connections and the blocks?
Everyone see this as the question? I

396
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
Everyone see this as the question? I
 

397
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,190
Everyone see this as the question? I
added a new idea adding these skips. So

398
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
added a new idea adding these skips. So
 

399
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,790
added a new idea adding these skips. So
we have to make sure we can make this

400
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
we have to make sure we can make this
 

401
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,150
we have to make sure we can make this
work with all of the ideas we had

402
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
work with all of the ideas we had
 

403
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,990
work with all of the ideas we had
before.

404
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
before.
 

405
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,550
before.
So the old way of thinking about this is

406
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
So the old way of thinking about this is
 

407
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,269
So the old way of thinking about this is
the is a picture uh that looks like this

408
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
the is a picture uh that looks like this
 

409
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,509
the is a picture uh that looks like this
which says

410
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
which says
 

411
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,550
which says
you have these normalization layers at

412
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
you have these normalization layers at
 

413
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,150
you have these normalization layers at
the end. So what's the logic? You do

414
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
the end. So what's the logic? You do
 

415
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,470
the end. So what's the logic? You do
some processing

416
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
some processing
 

417
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,470
some processing
then maybe things have gotten out of

418
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
then maybe things have gotten out of
 

419
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,470
then maybe things have gotten out of
hand and have gotten too big or not

420
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
hand and have gotten too big or not
 

421
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,069
hand and have gotten too big or not
behaving properly. So you stick in a

422
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
behaving properly. So you stick in a
 

423
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,069
behaving properly. So you stick in a
normalization layer to force it back to

424
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
normalization layer to force it back to
 

425
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,670
normalization layer to force it back to
where it needs to be and then you

426
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
where it needs to be and then you
 

427
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,710
where it needs to be and then you
continue. Everyone with me? So this is

428
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
continue. Everyone with me? So this is
 

429
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,350
continue. Everyone with me? So this is
the old perspective. Again, many papers

430
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
the old perspective. Again, many papers
 

431
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,750
the old perspective. Again, many papers
are written from this kind of

432
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
are written from this kind of
 

433
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,790
are written from this kind of
perspective. Uh there's one that's

434
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
perspective. Uh there's one that's
 

435
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,310
perspective. Uh there's one that's
particularly important that we'll talk

436
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
particularly important that we'll talk
 

437
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,710
particularly important that we'll talk
about later that you need to be aware of

438
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
about later that you need to be aware of
 

439
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,150
about later that you need to be aware of
uh which some students find quite

440
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
uh which some students find quite
 

441
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,790
uh which some students find quite
confusing which is the very famous

442
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
confusing which is the very famous
 

443
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,150
confusing which is the very famous
attention is all you need paper in 2017

444
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
attention is all you need paper in 2017
 

445
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,949
attention is all you need paper in 2017
is also written implicitly with this

446
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
is also written implicitly with this
 

447
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,949
is also written implicitly with this
style of thinking in it. However, that

448
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
style of thinking in it. However, that
 

449
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,790
style of thinking in it. However, that
style of thinking is now

450
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
style of thinking is now
 

451
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,590
style of thinking is now
more or less as a default obsolete. So I

452
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:17,600
more or less as a default obsolete. So I
 

453
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,790
more or less as a default obsolete. So I
want to talk about what how you think

454
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
want to talk about what how you think
 

455
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,269
want to talk about what how you think
about it in a more current perspective.

456
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
about it in a more current perspective.
 

457
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,710
about it in a more current perspective.
So what do you actually need to do? What

458
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
So what do you actually need to do? What
 

459
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,870
So what do you actually need to do? What
matters? Why did people observe that you

460
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
matters? Why did people observe that you
 

461
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,829
matters? Why did people observe that you
needed to have two?

462
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
needed to have two?
 

463
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,750
needed to have two?
So the core thing that it turns out you

464
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
So the core thing that it turns out you
 

465
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,110
So the core thing that it turns out you
need uh as a minimal object that sits

466
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
need uh as a minimal object that sits
 

467
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,949
need uh as a minimal object that sits
inside of the block that's going to get

468
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
inside of the block that's going to get
 

469
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,949
inside of the block that's going to get
skipped over is something that looks

470
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
skipped over is something that looks
 

471
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,550
skipped over is something that looks
like this.

472
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560

 

473
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,470

So let's think about this. This is

474
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
So let's think about this. This is
 

475
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,750
So let's think about this. This is
something that should be very familiar

476
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
something that should be very familiar
 

477
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,310
something that should be very familiar
to you everyone.

478
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
to you everyone.
 

479
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,470
to you everyone.
This is the first neural net that you

480
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
This is the first neural net that you
 

481
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,069
This is the first neural net that you
saw in the class and discussion was this

482
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
saw in the class and discussion was this
 

483
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,069
saw in the class and discussion was this
right? Remember the thinking thinking

484
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
right? Remember the thinking thinking
 

485
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,269
right? Remember the thinking thinking
behind it was you have some inputs you

486
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
behind it was you have some inputs you
 

487
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,829
behind it was you have some inputs you
have some weights you have some biases

488
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
have some weights you have some biases
 

489
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,829
have some weights you have some biases
that made a bunch of elbow feature type

490
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
that made a bunch of elbow feature type
 

491
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,910
that made a bunch of elbow feature type
features then you had nine the

492
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
features then you had nine the
 

493
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,310
features then you had nine the
nonlinearity that made it happen but

494
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
nonlinearity that made it happen but
 

495
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,670
nonlinearity that made it happen but
then you need to combine them in

496
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
then you need to combine them in
 

497
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,430
then you need to combine them in
different ways and then you had another

498
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
different ways and then you had another
 

499
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,350
different ways and then you had another
set of weights and in particular there

500
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
set of weights and in particular there
 

501
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,150
set of weights and in particular there
was this problem that if you didn't have

502
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
was this problem that if you didn't have
 

503
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,990
was this problem that if you didn't have
this guy

504
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
this guy
 

505
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,910
this guy
the output of this is always going to be

506
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
the output of this is always going to be
 

507
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,750
the output of this is always going to be
positive

508
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
positive
 

509
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,269
positive
or zero and that's a bit weird. It It's

510
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
or zero and that's a bit weird. It It's
 

511
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,949
or zero and that's a bit weird. It It's
a very big limitation on what you can

512
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
a very big limitation on what you can
 

513
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,949
a very big limitation on what you can
express. But if you put these weights

514
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:30,959
express. But if you put these weights
 

515
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,150
express. But if you put these weights
afterwards, you can then go negative.

516
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
afterwards, you can then go negative.
 

517
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,310
afterwards, you can then go negative.
Everyone remember that? So it turns out

518
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
Everyone remember that? So it turns out
 

519
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,350
Everyone remember that? So it turns out
this is this is important.

520
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
this is this is important.
 

521
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,310
this is this is important.
Okay. So

522
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,320
Okay. So
 

523
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,590
Okay. So
why is this important? And here there's

524
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
why is this important? And here there's
 

525
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,190
why is this important? And here there's
uh you know early on there's papers

526
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,200
uh you know early on there's papers
 

527
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,190
uh you know early on there's papers
talking about exactly why working it out

528
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,200
talking about exactly why working it out
 

529
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,949
talking about exactly why working it out
uh mathematically, but it's useful to

530
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:50,959
uh mathematically, but it's useful to
 

531
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,550
uh mathematically, but it's useful to
think about this from an intuitive point

532
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
think about this from an intuitive point
 

533
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,670
think about this from an intuitive point
of view to grasp what's going on.

534
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
of view to grasp what's going on.
 

535
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,069
of view to grasp what's going on.
And the intuitive perspective is before

536
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
And the intuitive perspective is before
 

537
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,829
And the intuitive perspective is before
ResNets when you thought about a

538
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
ResNets when you thought about a
 

539
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,269
ResNets when you thought about a
multi-layer network what you had was a

540
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
multi-layer network what you had was a
 

541
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,310
multi-layer network what you had was a
bunch of nested functions. Does everyone

542
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
bunch of nested functions. Does everyone
 

543
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,150
bunch of nested functions. Does everyone
see that you take the output of one

544
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
see that you take the output of one
 

545
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,389
see that you take the output of one
layer as the input to the next. So this

546
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
layer as the input to the next. So this
 

547
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,430
layer as the input to the next. So this
is the first thing you see sees the

548
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
is the first thing you see sees the
 

549
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,430
is the first thing you see sees the
input and then the next layer sees that

550
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
input and then the next layer sees that
 

551
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,590
input and then the next layer sees that
as its input and so on and so on until

552
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600
as its input and so on and so on until
 

553
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,509
as its input and so on and so on until
the end.

554
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
the end.
 

555
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,430
the end.
Okay.

556
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
Okay.
 

557
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,470
Okay.
And the ResNet perspective

558
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
And the ResNet perspective
 

559
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,750
And the ResNet perspective
instead looks like this. Because you

560
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:27,760
instead looks like this. Because you
 

561
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,189
instead looks like this. Because you
have these skips,

562
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199

 

563
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,910

what you're doing is every layer's

564
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
what you're doing is every layer's
 

565
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,430
what you're doing is every layer's
output

566
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
output
 

567
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,350
output
is the output that was before it plus

568
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
is the output that was before it plus
 

569
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,350
is the output that was before it plus
some function, some new function acting

570
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:41,360
some function, some new function acting
 

571
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,710
some function, some new function acting
on the previous thing.

572
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
on the previous thing.
 

573
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,069
on the previous thing.
Did everyone see that?

574
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
Did everyone see that?
 

575
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,590
Did everyone see that?
So

576
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
So
 

577
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,310
So
if you squint at this a little bit, you

578
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
if you squint at this a little bit, you
 

579
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,910
if you squint at this a little bit, you
think, what does this remind you of,

580
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
think, what does this remind you of,
 

581
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,550
think, what does this remind you of,
right? Like anyone want to comment like

582
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
right? Like anyone want to comment like
 

583
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,150
right? Like anyone want to comment like
what kind of a thing does this look like

584
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
what kind of a thing does this look like
 

585
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,829
what kind of a thing does this look like
to you? Where have you seen this kind of

586
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:01,839
to you? Where have you seen this kind of
 

587
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,910
to you? Where have you seen this kind of
a thing before?

588
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:05,920

 

589
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,829

>> Yeah.

590
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:07,839
>> Yeah.
 

591
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,030
>> Yeah.
>> The way you might describe like a

592
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
>> The way you might describe like a
 

593
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,230
>> The way you might describe like a
system.

594
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,240
system.
 

595
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,430
system.
>> Yeah, it's like a recurrence relation

596
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
>> Yeah, it's like a recurrence relation
 

597
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,870
>> Yeah, it's like a recurrence relation
you might think of as like a system,

598
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
you might think of as like a system,
 

599
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,790
you might think of as like a system,
right? And if you think about those

600
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
right? And if you think about those
 

601
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,310
right? And if you think about those
recurrence relations that define

602
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
recurrence relations that define
 

603
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,230
recurrence relations that define
systems, you can think of them as

604
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
systems, you can think of them as
 

605
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,670
systems, you can think of them as
potentially coming from things like

606
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
potentially coming from things like
 

607
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,670
potentially coming from things like
discretizations of differential

608
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
discretizations of differential
 

609
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,350
discretizations of differential
equations,

610
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
equations,
 

611
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,310
equations,
right? So when you discretise a

612
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
right? So when you discretise a
 

613
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,670
right? So when you discretise a
differential equation, you get something

614
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
differential equation, you get something
 

615
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,790
differential equation, you get something
like this, except there's like a

616
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
like this, except there's like a
 

617
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,389
like this, except there's like a
multiplier here that says some something

618
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
multiplier here that says some something
 

619
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,430
multiplier here that says some something
small.

620
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440

 

621
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,550

So if you think of it that way, this G

622
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,560
So if you think of it that way, this G
 

623
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,230
So if you think of it that way, this G
thing, this is like if you write, so it

624
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
thing, this is like if you write, so it
 

625
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,110
thing, this is like if you write, so it
feels like, let me just make a write

626
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
feels like, let me just make a write
 

627
00:15:43,120 --> 00:16:09,350
feels like, let me just make a write
this out here.

628
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360

 

629
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,990

feels like this.

630
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
feels like this.
 

631
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,590
feels like this.
I think there's a step size missing but

632
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
I think there's a step size missing but
 

633
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,230
I think there's a step size missing but
kind of has this kind of feel. So if you

634
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,240
kind of has this kind of feel. So if you
 

635
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,310
kind of has this kind of feel. So if you
take this perspective,

636
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,320
take this perspective,
 

637
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,749
take this perspective,
what you're trying to do is you're

638
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
what you're trying to do is you're
 

639
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,749
what you're trying to do is you're
trying to design a differential equation

640
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
trying to design a differential equation
 

641
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,949
trying to design a differential equation
that has a flow that takes you to the

642
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:26,959
that has a flow that takes you to the
 

643
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,030
that has a flow that takes you to the
place you want to go.

644
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
place you want to go.
 

645
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,030
place you want to go.
You start with an input and you want to

646
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
You start with an input and you want to
 

647
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,990
You start with an input and you want to
let it compute by like moving it around

648
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
let it compute by like moving it around
 

649
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,189
let it compute by like moving it around
and then getting you to where you want

650
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
and then getting you to where you want
 

651
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,629
and then getting you to where you want
to go. It's a nonlinear differential

652
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
to go. It's a nonlinear differential
 

653
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,069
to go. It's a nonlinear differential
equation.

654
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079
equation.
 

655
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,430
equation.
So if you think of it that way now you

656
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:41,440
So if you think of it that way now you
 

657
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,550
So if you think of it that way now you
can appreciate more why the restriction

658
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
can appreciate more why the restriction
 

659
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,310
can appreciate more why the restriction
that G always be positive is bad is

660
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
that G always be positive is bad is
 

661
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,150
that G always be positive is bad is
really hurting you on what you can do

662
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
really hurting you on what you can do
 

663
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,990
really hurting you on what you can do
right you want to be able to sort of go

664
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
right you want to be able to sort of go
 

665
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,150
right you want to be able to sort of go
back and around

666
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
back and around
 

667
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,949
back and around
okay so that tells you why you know the

668
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
okay so that tells you why you know the
 

669
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,590
okay so that tells you why you know the
having a relu at the end all the time is

670
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
having a relu at the end all the time is
 

671
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,829
having a relu at the end all the time is
not a great idea

672
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:01,839
not a great idea
 

673
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,309
not a great idea
okay

674
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
okay
 

675
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,949
okay
so this hopefully helps now I wanted to

676
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
so this hopefully helps now I wanted to
 

677
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,429
so this hopefully helps now I wanted to
acknowge something right here. uh when

678
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
acknowge something right here. uh when
 

679
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,029
acknowge something right here. uh when
people first uh observed this and they

680
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,039
people first uh observed this and they
 

681
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,829
people first uh observed this and they
saw it, they were got quite excited and

682
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
saw it, they were got quite excited and
 

683
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,510
saw it, they were got quite excited and
uh another area uh sort of came into

684
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
uh another area uh sort of came into
 

685
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,909
uh another area uh sort of came into
being which was neural odes

686
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:25,919
being which was neural odes
 

687
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,590
being which was neural odes
where people think about differential

688
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
where people think about differential
 

689
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,070
where people think about differential
equations that are defined by neural

690
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
equations that are defined by neural
 

691
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,750
equations that are defined by neural
nets and resets felt like a neural OD

692
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
nets and resets felt like a neural OD
 

693
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,909
nets and resets felt like a neural OD
and people then it was really great

694
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
and people then it was really great
 

695
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,430
and people then it was really great
because suddenly

696
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:39,440
because suddenly
 

697
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,070
because suddenly
uh a lot of people became inspired from

698
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
uh a lot of people became inspired from
 

699
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,150
uh a lot of people became inspired from
the physics side and said we can think

700
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
the physics side and said we can think
 

701
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,230
the physics side and said we can think
about physics inspired neural networks

702
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
about physics inspired neural networks
 

703
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,750
about physics inspired neural networks
because now we can map them into resnets

704
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:49,760
because now we can map them into resnets
 

705
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,549
because now we can map them into resnets
and once you think of the OD perspective

706
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
and once you think of the OD perspective
 

707
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,230
and once you think of the OD perspective
you notice that when I wrote this thing

708
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
you notice that when I wrote this thing
 

709
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,990
you notice that when I wrote this thing
that should remind you of

710
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
that should remind you of
 

711
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,510
that should remind you of
you usually write it without a g

712
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
you usually write it without a g
 

713
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,230
you usually write it without a g
subscript t of course g can also def

714
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
subscript t of course g can also def
 

715
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,830
subscript t of course g can also def
depend on time that's also an od um time

716
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
depend on time that's also an od um time
 

717
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,390
depend on time that's also an od um time
varying but you used to write You you

718
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
varying but you used to write You you
 

719
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,510
varying but you used to write You you
think of writing it this way and a lot

720
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
think of writing it this way and a lot
 

721
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,390
think of writing it this way and a lot
of physical laws have this way. And so

722
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
of physical laws have this way. And so
 

723
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,990
of physical laws have this way. And so
people thought about hey if this is

724
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
people thought about hey if this is
 

725
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,150
people thought about hey if this is
interesting in physics maybe we can

726
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
interesting in physics maybe we can
 

727
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,430
interesting in physics maybe we can
bring this idea back to neural nets

728
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
bring this idea back to neural nets
 

729
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,110
bring this idea back to neural nets
and bringing the idea back to neural

730
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
and bringing the idea back to neural
 

731
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,270
and bringing the idea back to neural
nets of saying maybe there's useful

732
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
nets of saying maybe there's useful
 

733
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,029
nets of saying maybe there's useful
invariance of not having the G change or

734
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,039
invariance of not having the G change or
 

735
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,110
invariance of not having the G change or
not to change too much with time. Does

736
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
not to change too much with time. Does
 

737
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,230
not to change too much with time. Does
everyone see that as a way of thinking?

738
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
everyone see that as a way of thinking?
 

739
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,870
everyone see that as a way of thinking?
And so that translates into back into

740
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
And so that translates into back into
 

741
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,190
And so that translates into back into
the neural net perspective because

742
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
the neural net perspective because
 

743
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,310
the neural net perspective because
remember these G's here

744
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,320
remember these G's here
 

745
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,909
remember these G's here
are these boxes here. Does everyone see

746
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
are these boxes here. Does everyone see
 

747
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,510
are these boxes here. Does everyone see
that?

748
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
that?
 

749
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,909
that?
So what that suggests as an approach to

750
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
So what that suggests as an approach to
 

751
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,710
So what that suggests as an approach to
follow is to think about adding weight

752
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
follow is to think about adding weight
 

753
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,270
follow is to think about adding weight
sharing across depth.

754
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
sharing across depth.
 

755
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,750
sharing across depth.
Did everyone see that?

756
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
Did everyone see that?
 

757
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,870
Did everyone see that?
This is kind of how you go back and

758
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
This is kind of how you go back and
 

759
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,549
This is kind of how you go back and
forth across ideas. Neural net deep deep

760
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:02,559
forth across ideas. Neural net deep deep
 

761
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,310
forth across ideas. Neural net deep deep
deep neural nets are often about where

762
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
deep neural nets are often about where
 

763
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,750
deep neural nets are often about where
can you get an idea and how can you

764
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
can you get an idea and how can you
 

765
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,190
can you get an idea and how can you
figure out how to apply it and you see

766
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
figure out how to apply it and you see
 

767
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,669
figure out how to apply it and you see
does it work or not. So this turned out

768
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:09,679
does it work or not. So this turned out
 

769
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,310
does it work or not. So this turned out
to be quite helpful in many physics type

770
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
to be quite helpful in many physics type
 

771
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,350
to be quite helpful in many physics type
problems. Um but and people were really

772
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
problems. Um but and people were really
 

773
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,909
problems. Um but and people were really
hoping that the neural OD ideas when

774
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
hoping that the neural OD ideas when
 

775
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:23,029
hoping that the neural OD ideas when
applied to classical uh vision problems

776
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
applied to classical uh vision problems
 

777
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,990
applied to classical uh vision problems
would actually beat resonance. But it

778
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
would actually beat resonance. But it
 

779
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,710
would actually beat resonance. But it
turned out they didn't. Okay. And people

780
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
turned out they didn't. Okay. And people
 

781
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,029
turned out they didn't. Okay. And people
still don't completely understand why.

782
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
still don't completely understand why.
 

783
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,789
still don't completely understand why.
But something about the ResNet

784
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799
But something about the ResNet
 

785
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,029
But something about the ResNet
architecture without having that much

786
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
architecture without having that much
 

787
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,190
architecture without having that much
weight sharing uh having basically no

788
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
weight sharing uh having basically no
 

789
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,150
weight sharing uh having basically no
weight sharing across depth does better.

790
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,160
weight sharing across depth does better.
 

791
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,310
weight sharing across depth does better.
Um

792
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
Um
 

793
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,830
Um
so this just a little story uh on the

794
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:45,840
so this just a little story uh on the
 

795
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,669
so this just a little story uh on the
side about how the evolution of these

796
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
side about how the evolution of these
 

797
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,470
side about how the evolution of these
ideas happened. Um weight sharing across

798
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
ideas happened. Um weight sharing across
 

799
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,990
ideas happened. Um weight sharing across
layers is something which continues to

800
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
layers is something which continues to
 

801
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,029
layers is something which continues to
be actively investigated uh today even

802
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:55,039
be actively investigated uh today even
 

803
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,590
be actively investigated uh today even
in transformers and the like. So I do

804
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,600
in transformers and the like. So I do
 

805
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,630
in transformers and the like. So I do
want to acknowledge that that idea

806
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
want to acknowledge that that idea
 

807
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,590
want to acknowledge that that idea
hasn't gone away but uh for the reset

808
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
hasn't gone away but uh for the reset
 

809
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,549
hasn't gone away but uh for the reset
case it turned out that resonance

810
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:02,559
case it turned out that resonance
 

811
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,909
case it turned out that resonance
without weight sharing across layers did

812
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
without weight sharing across layers did
 

813
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,590
without weight sharing across layers did
better for vision problems. Yeah.

814
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
better for vision problems. Yeah.
 

815
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,070
better for vision problems. Yeah.
Question.

816
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
Question.
 

817
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,270
Question.
>> Yeah. Isn't there something about like

818
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280
>> Yeah. Isn't there something about like
 

819
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,950
>> Yeah. Isn't there something about like
in terms of like robotics when you're

820
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
in terms of like robotics when you're
 

821
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,430
in terms of like robotics when you're
learning system dynamics there's like

822
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
learning system dynamics there's like
 

823
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,990
learning system dynamics there's like
that kind of competition between the

824
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
that kind of competition between the
 

825
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,750
that kind of competition between the
output of a neural network and like the

826
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:17,760
output of a neural network and like the
 

827
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,990
output of a neural network and like the
true body physics. Is that is that kind

828
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
true body physics. Is that is that kind
 

829
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,510
true body physics. Is that is that kind
of similar to what you're talking about

830
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520
of similar to what you're talking about
 

831
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:21,990
of similar to what you're talking about
here?

832
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,000
here?
 

833
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,669
here?
>> So right now I'm just talking about the

834
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
>> So right now I'm just talking about the
 

835
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,070
>> So right now I'm just talking about the
inspiration from physics. So of course

836
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
inspiration from physics. So of course
 

837
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,669
inspiration from physics. So of course
physics inspired neural nets and

838
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
physics inspired neural nets and
 

839
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,110
physics inspired neural nets and
thinking about this when you're actually

840
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
thinking about this when you're actually
 

841
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,710
thinking about this when you're actually
interacting with the physical world

842
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
interacting with the physical world
 

843
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,310
interacting with the physical world
where you believe the physical physical

844
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
where you believe the physical physical
 

845
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,070
where you believe the physical physical
world is actually defined and governed

846
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,080
world is actually defined and governed
 

847
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,750
world is actually defined and governed
by differential equations that's very

848
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
by differential equations that's very
 

849
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,590
by differential equations that's very
useful and so that's another side I'm

850
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:37,600
useful and so that's another side I'm
 

851
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,669
useful and so that's another side I'm
not talking about which is that if you

852
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
not talking about which is that if you
 

853
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,789
not talking about which is that if you
have uh an actual OD that you believe

854
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799
have uh an actual OD that you believe
 

855
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,549
have uh an actual OD that you believe
governs the environment you can take

856
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
governs the environment you can take
 

857
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,870
governs the environment you can take
this perspective to fold a part of the

858
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:46,880
this perspective to fold a part of the
 

859
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,430
this perspective to fold a part of the
outside environment or simulated outside

860
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
outside environment or simulated outside
 

861
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,710
outside environment or simulated outside
environment into your neural net as a

862
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
environment into your neural net as a
 

863
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,590
environment into your neural net as a
frozen set of layers that's the world

864
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
frozen set of layers that's the world
 

865
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,710
frozen set of layers that's the world
and you can back prop through the world.

866
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
and you can back prop through the world.
 

867
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,390
and you can back prop through the world.
Okay, this is very useful in in idea. So

868
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
Okay, this is very useful in in idea. So
 

869
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,909
Okay, this is very useful in in idea. So
it is related but it's not what I was

870
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:05,919
it is related but it's not what I was
 

871
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,630
it is related but it's not what I was
particularly bringing up. Um other

872
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
particularly bringing up. Um other
 

873
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,750
particularly bringing up. Um other
questions on the I want to make sure

874
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
questions on the I want to make sure
 

875
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,870
questions on the I want to make sure
people understand the basics of this

876
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:10,880
people understand the basics of this
 

877
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,789
people understand the basics of this
resonate idea and potentially some of

878
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:12,799
resonate idea and potentially some of
 

879
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,029
resonate idea and potentially some of
the connections to neural. Yeah,

880
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,039
the connections to neural. Yeah,
 

881
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,390
the connections to neural. Yeah,
>> just going back a little bit. I'm a

little confused why

884
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000

 

885
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,430

doesn't

886
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440

 

887
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,510

Sorry.

888
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
Sorry.
 

889

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
>> Okay,
 

891
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,990
>> Okay,
>> that's a great question. I'll come back

893
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,669
>> that's a great question. I'll come back
to this. Okay, so the question was wait

894
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
to this. Okay, so the question was wait
 

895
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,669
to this. Okay, so the question was wait
um we said here the problem was

896
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
um we said here the problem was
 

897
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,990
um we said here the problem was
everything was blowing up here still

898
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
everything was blowing up here still
 

899
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,470
everything was blowing up here still
everything is still adding up so why

900
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,480
everything is still adding up so why
 

901
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,630
everything is still adding up so why
isn't everything blowing up here? Is

902
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
isn't everything blowing up here? Is
 

903
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,070
isn't everything blowing up here? Is
that am I getting your question right?

904
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
that am I getting your question right?
 

905
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,669
that am I getting your question right?
Okay, that's a great question. Let me

906
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
Okay, that's a great question. Let me
 

907
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,310
Okay, that's a great question. Let me
give you the brief answer.

908
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
give you the brief answer.
 

909
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,630
give you the brief answer.
When you unroll this,

910
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
When you unroll this,
 

911
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,029
When you unroll this,
thinking about unrolling this, what do

912
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
thinking about unrolling this, what do
 

913
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,390
thinking about unrolling this, what do
you get when you unroll a differential

914
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:54,400
you get when you unroll a differential
 

915
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,470
you get when you unroll a differential
equation like this? You get an integral.

916
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,480
equation like this? You get an integral.
 

917
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,990
equation like this? You get an integral.
So when you unroll this, you'll get a

918
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:58,000
So when you unroll this, you'll get a
 

919
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,750
So when you unroll this, you'll get a
sum. How many terms in the sum? Roughly

920
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
sum. How many terms in the sum? Roughly
 

921
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,990
sum. How many terms in the sum? Roughly
the number of blocks.

922
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,000
the number of blocks.
 

923
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,549
the number of blocks.
So it is growing, but it's growing

924
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
So it is growing, but it's growing
 

925
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,230
So it is growing, but it's growing
arithmetically

926
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,240
arithmetically
 

927
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,870
arithmetically
with depth. So now this connects to the

928
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880
with depth. So now this connects to the
 

929
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,310
with depth. So now this connects to the
issue of floatingoint precision, which I

930
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
issue of floatingoint precision, which I
 

931
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,430
issue of floatingoint precision, which I
want to talk about later, but I might as

932
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
want to talk about later, but I might as
 

933
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,710
want to talk about later, but I might as
well talk about it now since you asked

934
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
well talk about it now since you asked
 

935
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,789
well talk about it now since you asked
the question. Um, so if you have using

936
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:18,799
the question. Um, so if you have using
 

937
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,149
the question. Um, so if you have using
something like FB32, 32-bit floats, it

938
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:22,159
something like FB32, 32-bit floats, it
 

939
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,230
something like FB32, 32-bit floats, it
turns out you have plenty of dynamic

940
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240
turns out you have plenty of dynamic
 

941
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,390
turns out you have plenty of dynamic
range and you can absorb this kind of

942
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
range and you can absorb this kind of
 

943
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,789
range and you can absorb this kind of
arithmetic growth easily.

944
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
arithmetic growth easily.
 

945
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,270
arithmetic growth easily.
If you start shifting to smaller and

946
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280
If you start shifting to smaller and
 

947
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,830
If you start shifting to smaller and
smaller floatingoint representations,

948
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
smaller floatingoint representations,
 

949
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,590
smaller floatingoint representations,
this particular arithmetic growth can

950
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:35,600
this particular arithmetic growth can
 

951
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,590
this particular arithmetic growth can
start to become painful and then you

952
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
start to become painful and then you
 

953
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,590
start to become painful and then you
have to deal with it.

954
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:39,600
have to deal with it.
 

955
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,710
have to deal with it.
But uh at FP32, it's fine. FP16

956
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720
But uh at FP32, it's fine. FP16
 

957
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,070
But uh at FP32, it's fine. FP16
also fine if you do mixed uh mixed

958
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,080
also fine if you do mixed uh mixed
 

959
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,710
also fine if you do mixed uh mixed
precision uh training FB8 and the like

960
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:50,720
precision uh training FB8 and the like
 

961
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,710
precision uh training FB8 and the like
it becomes quite tricky and you saw in

962
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
it becomes quite tricky and you saw in
 

963
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,750
it becomes quite tricky and you saw in
the homework we gave you homework think

964
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
the homework we gave you homework think
 

965
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,310
the homework we gave you homework think
about how MUP works with uh a floating

966
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:56,320
about how MUP works with uh a floating
 

967
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,350
about how MUP works with uh a floating
point and then you have to use tricks

968
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
point and then you have to use tricks
 

969
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,590
point and then you have to use tricks
like that to try to do rescalings that

970
00:22:59,590 --> 00:22:59,600
like that to try to do rescalings that
 

971
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,590
like that to try to do rescalings that
are different on the forward path and on

972
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:01,600
are different on the forward path and on
 

973
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,270
are different on the forward path and on
the backward path to keep everything in

974
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
the backward path to keep everything in
 

975
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,149
the backward path to keep everything in
the right uh scale and if you've seen

976
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:06,159
the right uh scale and if you've seen
 

977
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,029
the right uh scale and if you've seen
recently uh Nvidia has released an FP4

978
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:11,039
recently uh Nvidia has released an FP4
 

979
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,029
recently uh Nvidia has released an FP4
format So fourbit numbers four bits

980
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:15,039
format So fourbit numbers four bits
 

981
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,230
format So fourbit numbers four bits
remember four bits is 16 numbers just 16

982
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
remember four bits is 16 numbers just 16
 

983
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,669
remember four bits is 16 numbers just 16
and talking about how you can get

984
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:19,679
and talking about how you can get
 

985
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,149
and talking about how you can get
training to work sometimes keeping you

986
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:22,159
training to work sometimes keeping you
 

987
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,950
training to work sometimes keeping you
know stuff at four bit precision. So

988
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:24,960
know stuff at four bit precision. So
 

989
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,950
know stuff at four bit precision. So
people are p pushing on this precision

990
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:26,960
people are p pushing on this precision
 

991
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,549
people are p pushing on this precision

994
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
connections. Okay. Does that answer your
 

995
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:40,310
connections. Okay. Does that answer your
question nicely?

996
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,320

 

997
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,470

>> Ah great question. So if you add

998
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
>> Ah great question. So if you add
 

999
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,590
>> Ah great question. So if you add
everything in uh here then it's not

1000
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
everything in uh here then it's not
 

1001
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,870
everything in uh here then it's not
because what's happening is that you

1002
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:46,880
because what's happening is that you
 

1003
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,310
because what's happening is that you
it's also happening at all previous

1004
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:48,320
it's also happening at all previous
 

1005
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,750
it's also happening at all previous
levels and so it's kind of blowing up um

1006
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
levels and so it's kind of blowing up um
 

1007
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,669
levels and so it's kind of blowing up um
as a result. Of course normalizations

1008
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679
as a result. Of course normalizations
 

1009
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,510
as a result. Of course normalizations
would change that if you inserted

1010
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
would change that if you inserted
 

1011
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,190
would change that if you inserted
normalizations inside these boxes it

1012
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
normalizations inside these boxes it
 

1013
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,510
normalizations inside these boxes it
would potentially change it but I want

1014
00:23:59,510 --> 00:23:59,520
would potentially change it but I want
 

1015
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,430
would potentially change it but I want
to acknowledge there is a difference

1016
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
to acknowledge there is a difference
 

1017
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,310
to acknowledge there is a difference
between this and this.

1018
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
between this and this.
 

1019
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,909
between this and this.
Um yes another question.

1020
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
Um yes another question.
 

1021
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,990
Um yes another question.

1031
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,110
between weight sharing and uh not weight

1032
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
sharing. So, when I do when I write it
 

1033
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,230
sharing. So, when I do when I write it
this way, the picture here, this is this

1034
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:32,240
this way, the picture here, this is this
 

1035
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,070
this way, the picture here, this is this
has some weights associated with it. So,

1036
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
has some weights associated with it. So,
 

1037
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,149
has some weights associated with it. So,
this is the first set of weights. This

1038
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
this is the first set of weights. This
 

1039
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,390
this is the first set of weights. This
is a second set of weights. This is a

is a second set of weights. This is a
 

1041
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,870
is a second set of weights. This is a
third set of weights. This is a i set of

1042
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
third set of weights. This is a i set of
 

1043
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,190
third set of weights. This is a i set of
weights. You know, this is the

1044
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,200
weights. You know, this is the
 

1045
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,710
weights. You know, this is the
nth set of weights and this is the n

1046
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
nth set of weights and this is the n
 

1047
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,390
nth set of weights and this is the n
minus one set of weights. You know,

1048
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
minus one set of weights. You know,
 

1049
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,230
minus one set of weights. You know,
think of it this way. They're all

1050
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,240
think of it this way. They're all
 

1051
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,789
think of it this way. They're all
different weights. When we think about a

1052
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:54,799
different weights. When we think about a
 

1053
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,549
different weights. When we think about a
neural net by default, there's no weight

1054
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559

1055
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,549

1057
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,190

in a conet is spatial. As you slide the

in a conet is spatial. As you slide the
filters around there, the weights are

1061
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,669

1101
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,950

is we've talked about the basic story
the core

1104
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,120
the core
 

1105
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,310
the core
you need to have something like this

1106
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,320
you need to have something like this
 

1107
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,870
you need to have something like this
that you skip over. Oh yeah question.

1108
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:54,880
that you skip over. Oh yeah question.
 

1109
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,549
that you skip over. Oh yeah question.
I'm just wondering like what would you

I'm just wondering like what would you
 

1111
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,390

highway people believe the main thing is

1128
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,320
highway people believe the main thing is
 

1129
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,830
highway people believe the main thing is
it lets the gradients go back to

1130
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:19,840
it lets the gradients go back to
 

1131
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,350
it lets the gradients go back to
everybody

1132
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,360
everybody
 

1133
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,390
everybody
okay that's the clean answer that the

1134
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:24,400
okay that's the clean answer that the
 

1135
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,990
okay that's the clean answer that the
fact that it could also look like this

1136
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,000
fact that it could also look like this
 

1137
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,149
fact that it could also look like this
make inspired people to think about it

1138
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:28,159
make inspired people to think about it
 

1139
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,830
make inspired people to think about it
as the expressive powers of odes which

1140
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:31,840
as the expressive powers of odes which
 

1141
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,190
as the expressive powers of odes which
if you think about it what they're

1142
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,200
if you think about it what they're
 

1143
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,789
if you think about it what they're
thinking about is odes are natural and

1144
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:36,799
thinking about is odes are natural and
 

1145
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,029
thinking about is odes are natural and
define things in the world but they also

1146
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
define things in the world but they also
 

1147
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,230
define things in the world but they also
represent a kind of parsimony or compact

1148
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:42,240
represent a kind of parsimony or compact
 

1149
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,630
represent a kind of parsimony or compact
representation of physics with simple

1150
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
representation of physics with simple
 

1151
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,149
representation of physics with simple
equations and so people were attracted

1152
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:48,159
equations and so people were attracted
 

1153
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,669
equations and so people were attracted
by the idea that maybe if I could build

1154
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
by the idea that maybe if I could build
 

1155
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,510
by the idea that maybe if I could build
in the right kind of parsimony the right

1156
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,520
in the right kind of parsimony the right
 

1157
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,510
in the right kind of parsimony the right
kind of limited number of parameters by

1158
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
kind of limited number of parameters by
 

1159
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,430
kind of limited number of parameters by
doing parameter sharing I would get a

1160
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
doing parameter sharing I would get a
 

1161
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,909
doing parameter sharing I would get a
more faithful representation of reality

1162
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
more faithful representation of reality
 

1163
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,510
more faithful representation of reality
and it would be easier to train which is

1164
00:26:59,510 --> 00:26:59,520
and it would be easier to train which is
 

1165
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,549
and it would be easier to train which is
a classical ML perspective but it turns

1166
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
a classical ML perspective but it turns
 

1167
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,710
a classical ML perspective but it turns
out that for lots of neural nets having

1168
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
out that for lots of neural nets having
 

1169
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,470
out that for lots of neural nets having
lots of parameters doesn't hurt you in

1170
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
lots of parameters doesn't hurt you in
 

1171
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,990
lots of parameters doesn't hurt you in
fact it can help you and that was

1172
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
fact it can help you and that was
 

1173
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,190
fact it can help you and that was
another theme of research that happened

1174
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,200
another theme of research that happened
 

1175
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,230
another theme of research that happened
we're not talking about it right now but

1176
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
we're not talking about it right now but
 

1177
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,310
we're not talking about it right now but
okay so I want to get back to the issue

1178
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,320
okay so I want to get back to the issue
 

1179
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,710
okay so I want to get back to the issue
of uh the normalizations

1180
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
of uh the normalizations
 

1181
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,110
of uh the normalizations
and here I want to recognize the modern

1182
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
and here I want to recognize the modern
 

1183
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,990
and here I want to recognize the modern
default which is different than this

1184
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,000
default which is different than this
 

1185
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,870
default which is different than this
approach So in the past people would do

1186
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:24,880
approach So in the past people would do
 

1187
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,149
approach So in the past people would do
things like this which is called

1188
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
things like this which is called
 

1189
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,669
things like this which is called
postnormalization

1190
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
postnormalization
 

1191
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,269
postnormalization
where you'd put the normalizations at

1192
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
where you'd put the normalizations at
 

1193
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,149
where you'd put the normalizations at
the end and the modern uh default is

1194
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:34,159
the end and the modern uh default is
 

1195
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,510
the end and the modern uh default is
normalizations go inside a block and

1196
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520
normalizations go inside a block and
 

1197
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,230
normalizations go inside a block and
they go near the beginning of the block.

1198
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
they go near the beginning of the block.
 

1199
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,909
they go near the beginning of the block.
So if you have to make a design you you

1200
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
So if you have to make a design you you
 

1201
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,390
So if you have to make a design you you
do that.

1202
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:44,400
do that.
 

1203
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:52,230
do that.
Okay. So here's an example like this.

1204
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240

 

1205
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,590

So remember here I'll use the blue

1206
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600
So remember here I'll use the blue
 

1207
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,350
So remember here I'll use the blue
color. The skip is going like this

1208
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
color. The skip is going like this
 

1209
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,669
color. The skip is going like this
over everything.

1210
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:03,679

 

1211
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,750

So what this does is this makes it be

1212
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:07,760
So what this does is this makes it be
 

1213
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,669
So what this does is this makes it be
the case that there are no

1214
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
the case that there are no
 

1215
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,110
the case that there are no
normalizations along the skip paths. So

1216
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,120
normalizations along the skip paths. So
 

1217
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,110
normalizations along the skip paths. So
from the end to the beginning it never

1218
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120
from the end to the beginning it never
 

1219
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,190
from the end to the beginning it never
the gradient never experiences a norm

1220
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
the gradient never experiences a norm
 

1221
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,190
the gradient never experiences a norm
a normalization layer just keeps hopping

1222
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,200
a normalization layer just keeps hopping
 

1223
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,389
a normalization layer just keeps hopping
back

1224
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:24,399

 

1225
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,750

and you put the norm uh near the

1226
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:27,760
and you put the norm uh near the
 

1227
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,430
and you put the norm uh near the
beginning as opposed to near the end. So

1228
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
beginning as opposed to near the end. So
 

1229
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,190
beginning as opposed to near the end. So
there's inside the block versus outside

1230
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,200
there's inside the block versus outside
 

1231
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,190
there's inside the block versus outside
the block.

1232
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,200
the block.
 

1233
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,190
the block.
The modern choice is inside the block

1234
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
The modern choice is inside the block
 

1235
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,950
The modern choice is inside the block
and then there's near the end or near

1236
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:36,960
and then there's near the end or near
 

1237
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,870
and then there's near the end or near
the beginning and the modern choice is

1238
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
the beginning and the modern choice is
 

1239
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,070
the beginning and the modern choice is
near the beginning.

1240
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
near the beginning.
 

1241
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,310
near the beginning.
and the near the beginning basically

1242
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:44,320
and the near the beginning basically
 

1243
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,710
and the near the beginning basically
says look a bunch of stuff might have

1244
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
says look a bunch of stuff might have
 

1245
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,750
says look a bunch of stuff might have
been added

1246
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:49,760
been added
 

1247
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,149
been added
up by the time I got here. So maybe the

1248
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
up by the time I got here. So maybe the
 

1249
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,070
up by the time I got here. So maybe the
activations are big or weird or

1250
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,080
activations are big or weird or
 

1251
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,110
activations are big or weird or
something. I'll normalize them first. So

1252
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,120
something. I'll normalize them first. So
 

1253
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,029
something. I'll normalize them first. So
now they're where I want them and now

1254
00:28:59,029 --> 00:28:59,039
now they're where I want them and now
 

1255
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:05,669
now they're where I want them and now
I'll act on this.

1256
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679

 

1257
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,950

Okay, any questions on this? And the the

1258
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
Okay, any questions on this? And the the
 

1259
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,110
Okay, any questions on this? And the the
practical importance is it's associated

1260
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,120
practical importance is it's associated
 

1261
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,549
practical importance is it's associated
with even more more stable training.

1262
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:14,559
with even more more stable training.
 

1263
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,110
with even more more stable training.
>> Yeah.

1264
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,120
>> Yeah.
 

1265
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,870
>> Yeah.
>> Is it not symmetric to just have the

00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:16,880
>> Is it not symmetric to just have the
 

1267
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,350
>> Is it not symmetric to just have the
normalization at the end because if you

1268
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
normalization at the end because if you
 

1269
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,990
normalization at the end because if you
go to the next layer

1270
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,000
go to the next layer
 

1271
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,710
go to the next layer
at the end

1272
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:22,720
at the end
 

1273
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,269
at the end
>> okay that's a great question. So the

1274
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:25,279
>> okay that's a great question. So the
 

1275
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,549
>> okay that's a great question. So the
question I'll repeat for everyone make

1276
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:26,559
question I'll repeat for everyone make
 

1277
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,830
question I'll repeat for everyone make
sure it's recorded properly is

1278
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
sure it's recorded properly is
 

1279
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,630
sure it's recorded properly is
why does beginning versus end matter

1280
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:32,640
why does beginning versus end matter
 

1281
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,950
why does beginning versus end matter
when everything is just repeated over

1282
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:34,960
when everything is just repeated over
 

1283
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,909
when everything is just repeated over
and over again. So the end of this is

1284
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:37,919
and over again. So the end of this is
 

1285
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,669
and over again. So the end of this is
the beginning of the next guy. So what

1286
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:39,679
the beginning of the next guy. So what
 

1287
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,950
the beginning of the next guy. So what
does it matter? Am I getting your

1288
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
does it matter? Am I getting your
 

1289
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,389
does it matter? Am I getting your
question correctly? Okay. So it matters.

1290
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:44,399
question correctly? Okay. So it matters.
 

1291
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,870
question correctly? Okay. So it matters.
It matters because the skips are

1292
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:48,880
It matters because the skips are
 

1293
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,470
It matters because the skips are
outside. Remember the first choice is

1294
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
outside. Remember the first choice is
 

1295
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,590
outside. Remember the first choice is
are this is the norms are do norms occur

1296
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:53,600
are this is the norms are do norms occur
 

1297
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,630
are this is the norms are do norms occur
inside the skips along the skip path or

1298
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
inside the skips along the skip path or
 

1299
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,669
inside the skips along the skip path or
not? And I'm saying not. Once you make

1300
00:29:59,669 --> 00:29:59,679
not? And I'm saying not. Once you make
 

1301
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,710
not? And I'm saying not. Once you make
that choice, it's very different.

1302
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:02,720
that choice, it's very different.
 

1303
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,870
that choice, it's very different.
Okay? Because if I put a norm at the end

1304
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:04,880
Okay? Because if I put a norm at the end
 

1305
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,230
Okay? Because if I put a norm at the end
of this block hypothetically and then I

1306
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,240
of this block hypothetically and then I
 

1307
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,630
of this block hypothetically and then I
skip over it, the input to the next

1308
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:10,640
skip over it, the input to the next
 

1309
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,990
skip over it, the input to the next
block doesn't get the benefit of that

1310
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
block doesn't get the benefit of that
 

1311
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,230
block doesn't get the benefit of that
norm hypothetical norm that that you

1312
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,240
norm hypothetical norm that that you
 

1313
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,990
norm hypothetical norm that that you
were talking about drawing. So it makes

1314
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,000
were talking about drawing. So it makes
 

1315
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,950
were talking about drawing. So it makes
a difference. Um now people I say this

1316
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:20,960
a difference. Um now people I say this
 

1317
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,310
a difference. Um now people I say this
associated with more stable training. it

1318
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:22,320
associated with more stable training. it
 

1319
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,750
associated with more stable training. it
is the default if you have to do

1320
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
is the default if you have to do
 

1321
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,230
is the default if you have to do
something that said there are a few

1322
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:26,240
something that said there are a few
 

1323
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,350
something that said there are a few
recent papers that look at this question

1324
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
recent papers that look at this question
 

1325
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,430
recent papers that look at this question
of pre-orm versus postnorm in even

1326
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
of pre-orm versus postnorm in even
 

1327
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,070
of pre-orm versus postnorm in even
modern architectures and some

1328
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
modern architectures and some
 

1329
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,230
modern architectures and some
architectures claim that by doing a

1330
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
architectures claim that by doing a
 

1331
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,230
architectures claim that by doing a
little bit of postnorm you can ek out a

1332
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,240
little bit of postnorm you can ek out a
 

1333
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,389
little bit of postnorm you can ek out a
little bit extra performance

1334
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:40,399
little bit extra performance
 

1335
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,870
little bit extra performance
for reasons that are not quite clear. So

1336
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:42,880
for reasons that are not quite clear. So
 

1337
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,230
for reasons that are not quite clear. So
sometimes people will use a little bit

1338
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,240
sometimes people will use a little bit
 

1339
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,350
sometimes people will use a little bit
of postnorm in some places but again the

1340
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,360
of postnorm in some places but again the
 

1341
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,230
of postnorm in some places but again the
default now is to do it pre-orm.

1342
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240

 

1343
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,830

Okay,

1344
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:53,840
Okay,
 

1345
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,310
Okay,
any questions on this?

1346
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
any questions on this?
 

1347
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,990
any questions on this?
So there's a really nice figure in

1348
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
So there's a really nice figure in
 

1349
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,710
So there's a really nice figure in
printince that helps you see uh sort of

1350
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
printince that helps you see uh sort of
 

1351
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,549
printince that helps you see uh sort of
what's happening.

1352
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:02,559
what's happening.
 

1353
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,430
what's happening.
So I thought I'd just replicate it

1354
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:05,440
So I thought I'd just replicate it
 

1355
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,389
So I thought I'd just replicate it
uh for everybody.

1356
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:08,399
uh for everybody.
 

1357
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,870
uh for everybody.
So what this does is it just

1358
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
So what this does is it just
 

1359
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,110
So what this does is it just
grinds through and says look if I take

1360
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,120
grinds through and says look if I take
 

1361
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,630
grinds through and says look if I take
this architecture as f1 f_sub_2 f3 f4

1362
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:18,640
this architecture as f1 f_sub_2 f3 f4
 

1363
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,430
this architecture as f1 f_sub_2 f3 f4
and just expand it out of what does that

1364
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:21,440
and just expand it out of what does that
 

1365
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,630
and just expand it out of what does that
actually mean you get

1366
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:24,640
actually mean you get
 

1367
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,669
actually mean you get
uh this thing if you want to make it

1368
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
uh this thing if you want to make it
 

1369
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,950
uh this thing if you want to make it
look like what's what's what's happening

1370
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:26,960
look like what's what's what's happening
 

1371
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,549
look like what's what's what's happening
in in potential parallel for the

1372
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:28,559
in in potential parallel for the
 

1373
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,549
in in potential parallel for the
gradient paths. So this shows you

1374
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:30,559
gradient paths. So this shows you
 

1375
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,110
gradient paths. So this shows you
directly that a gradient that comes back

1376
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,120
directly that a gradient that comes back
 

1377
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,789
directly that a gradient that comes back
here, remember a plus distributes the

1378
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:34,799
here, remember a plus distributes the
 

1379
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,590
here, remember a plus distributes the
gradient out, the gradient coming here,

1380
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:37,600
gradient out, the gradient coming here,
 

1381
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,470
gradient out, the gradient coming here,
it goes straight back to x, it goes to

1382
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:40,480
it goes straight back to x, it goes to
 

1383
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,990
it goes straight back to x, it goes to
f1.

1384
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,000
f1.
 

1385
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,630
f1.
It uh it goes see another path here. It

1386
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:48,640
It uh it goes see another path here. It
 

1387
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,149
It uh it goes see another path here. It
f there's f1. There's a path to f2 also.

1388
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:52,159
f there's f1. There's a path to f2 also.
 

1389
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,710
f there's f1. There's a path to f2 also.
Yeah, path to f2.

1390
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
Yeah, path to f2.
 

1391
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,630
Yeah, path to f2.
It goes to f3 and it goes to f4. So all

1392
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:58,640
It goes to f3 and it goes to f4. So all
 

1393
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,590
It goes to f3 and it goes to f4. So all
of the SS see directly that gradient.

1394
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:01,600
of the SS see directly that gradient.
 

1395
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,029
of the SS see directly that gradient.
You can see it from this perspective

1396
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:03,039
You can see it from this perspective
 

1397
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,269
You can see it from this perspective
more easily. Some people find this

1398
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:05,279
more easily. Some people find this
 

1399
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,789
more easily. Some people find this
useful. So I wanted to bring that up to

1400
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:06,799
useful. So I wanted to bring that up to
 

1401
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,470
useful. So I wanted to bring that up to
everyone.

1402
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:08,480
everyone.
 

1403
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,909
everyone.
So this is the gradient superighway

1404
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:09,919
So this is the gradient superighway
 

1405
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,149
So this is the gradient superighway
dimension of the uh residual

1406
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
dimension of the uh residual
 

1407
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,750
dimension of the uh residual
connections.

1408
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:13,760
connections.
 

1409
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,509
connections.
Okay.

1410
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:15,519
Okay.
 

1411
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,669
Okay.
So now uh with the residual connections

1412
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
So now uh with the residual connections
 

1413
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,070
So now uh with the residual connections
uh that are done, you might think, okay,

1414
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,080
uh that are done, you might think, okay,
 

1415
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,909
uh that are done, you might think, okay,
great. We know how to do this. We're

1416
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:23,919
great. We know how to do this. We're
 

1417
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,269
great. We know how to do this. We're
happy. Let's move on. There's one little

1418
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:27,279
happy. Let's move on. There's one little
 

1419
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,950
happy. Let's move on. There's one little
issue that we'll also talk about in

1420
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
issue that we'll also talk about in
 

1421
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,470
issue that we'll also talk about in
discussion but I wanted to make sure we

1422
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:30,480
discussion but I wanted to make sure we
 

1423
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,549
discussion but I wanted to make sure we
mention it here.

1424
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:32,559
mention it here.
 

1425
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,070
mention it here.
So here's a figure uh from Prince uh for

1426
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,080
So here's a figure uh from Prince uh for
 

1427
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,470
So here's a figure uh from Prince uh for
the you know very famous ResNet 200

1428
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,480
the you know very famous ResNet 200
 

1429
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,070
the you know very famous ResNet 200
architecture

1430
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,080
architecture
 

1431
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,310
architecture
of how does that look for doing image

1432
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,320
of how does that look for doing image
 

1433
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,389
of how does that look for doing image
classification. So this is for imageet.

1434
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:44,399
classification. So this is for imageet.
 

1435
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,110
classification. So this is for imageet.
So, imaget has a thousand uh classes

1436
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,120
So, imaget has a thousand uh classes
 

1437
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,149
So, imaget has a thousand uh classes
that uh people want to classify to. And

1438
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:50,159
that uh people want to classify to. And
 

1439
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,310
that uh people want to classify to. And
the way it works is it's using residual

1440
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
the way it works is it's using residual
 

1441
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,430
the way it works is it's using residual
blocks, but it's still following the

1442
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:55,440
blocks, but it's still following the
 

1443
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,230
blocks, but it's still following the
same pattern that we saw in older neural

1444
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,240
same pattern that we saw in older neural
 

1445
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,909
same pattern that we saw in older neural
nets, which is you still want to do this

1446
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
nets, which is you still want to do this
 

1447
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,630
nets, which is you still want to do this
image starts out big, then you make it

1448
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:04,640
image starts out big, then you make it
 

1449
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,470
image starts out big, then you make it
smaller, but add more channels, then you

1450
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:06,480
smaller, but add more channels, then you
 

1451
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,990
smaller, but add more channels, then you
make it smaller and add more channels

1452
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
make it smaller and add more channels
 

1453
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,029
make it smaller and add more channels
with distill information down. Remember

1454
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,039
with distill information down. Remember
 

1455
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,029
with distill information down. Remember
that principle from earlier? So you

1456
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:13,039
that principle from earlier? So you
 

1457
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,830
that principle from earlier? So you
still want to do that. So you know you

1458
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:15,840
still want to do that. So you know you
 

1459
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,389
still want to do that. So you know you
start with something big, you do make it

1460
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:18,399
start with something big, you do make it
 

1461
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,430
start with something big, you do make it
smaller, you have some uh these residual

1462
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:21,440
smaller, you have some uh these residual
 

1463
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,350
smaller, you have some uh these residual
blocks that all look like this. So this

1464
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
blocks that all look like this. So this
 

1465
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,909
blocks that all look like this. So this
is the old this is uh you know there's a

1466
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:25,919
is the old this is uh you know there's a
 

1467
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,630
is the old this is uh you know there's a
batchorm relu con batchorm relu con

1468
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640
batchorm relu con batchorm relu con
 

1469
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,669
batchorm relu con batchorm relu con
batchorm relu like this

1470
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:35,679

 

1471
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,990

and but then you have to make it

1472
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
and but then you have to make it
 

1473
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,990
and but then you have to make it
smaller.

1474
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,000
smaller.
 

1475
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,470
smaller.
Okay. So some kind of subsampling uh

1476
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,480
Okay. So some kind of subsampling uh
 

1477
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,149
Okay. So some kind of subsampling uh
step happens. Then you have some more

1478
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
step happens. Then you have some more
 

1479
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,070
step happens. Then you have some more
blocks. You make it smaller. Some more

1480
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,080
blocks. You make it smaller. Some more
 

1481
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,190
blocks. You make it smaller. Some more
blocks. Smaller more blocks. And

1482
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200
blocks. Smaller more blocks. And
 

1483
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,630
blocks. Smaller more blocks. And
interesting design choice that they

1484
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:50,640
interesting design choice that they
 

1485
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,990
interesting design choice that they
found in uh this in these resets was

1486
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,000
found in uh this in these resets was
 

1487
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,029
found in uh this in these resets was
that in the old days what you would do

1488
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:57,039
that in the old days what you would do
 

1489
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,870
that in the old days what you would do
was you would take at the end you would

1490
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:58,880
was you would take at the end you would
 

1491
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,909
was you would take at the end you would
take the entire image all the channels

1492
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:01,919
take the entire image all the channels
 

1493
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,710
take the entire image all the channels
flatten it into a giant thing and run it

1494
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:04,720
flatten it into a giant thing and run it
 

1495
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,550
flatten it into a giant thing and run it
through an MLP for classification.

1496
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:08,560

 

1497
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,629

What they decided was no, we're not

1498
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:10,639
What they decided was no, we're not
 

1499
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,669
What they decided was no, we're not
going to do that. Instead, they take the

1500
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:13,679
going to do that. Instead, they take the
 

1501
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,550
going to do that. Instead, they take the
entire image. So these are like seven by

1502
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:16,560
entire image. So these are like seven by
 

1503
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,149
entire image. So these are like seven by
seven images. The entire image has been

1504
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:18,159
seven images. The entire image has been
 

1505
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,869
seven images. The entire image has been
shrunk down to 7 by7. They take the 7

1506
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879
shrunk down to 7 by7. They take the 7
 

1507
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,790
shrunk down to 7 by7. They take the 7
by7 image and they do what's called a

1508
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:22,800
by7 image and they do what's called a
 

1509
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,109
by7 image and they do what's called a
global average pool.

1510
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:25,119
global average pool.
 

1511
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,629
global average pool.
They take every channel and they just

1512
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
They take every channel and they just
 

1513
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,190
They take every channel and they just
average it across space. You can think

1514
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,200
average it across space. You can think
 

1515
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,470
average it across space. You can think
about this. Remember the intuition that

1516
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,480
about this. Remember the intuition that
 

1517
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,470
about this. Remember the intuition that
there's a catnness

1518
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:32,480
there's a catnness
 

1519
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,669
there's a catnness
channel. So now you say, I don't care

1520
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:35,679
channel. So now you say, I don't care
 

1521
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,829
channel. So now you say, I don't care
where the cat is in the picture. Just

1522
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:37,839
where the cat is in the picture. Just
 

1523
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,909
where the cat is in the picture. Just
tell me the average catness of this

1524
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:39,919
tell me the average catness of this
 

1525
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,030
tell me the average catness of this
entire image. So you do a global average

1526
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,040
entire image. So you do a global average
 

1527
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,550
entire image. So you do a global average
pool to compress it down. Now you just

1528
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
pool to compress it down. Now you just
 

1529
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,950
pool to compress it down. Now you just
have the channels and then you run the

1530
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:46,960
have the channels and then you run the
 

1531
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,030
have the channels and then you run the
channels through a fully connected layer

1532
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,040
channels through a fully connected layer
 

1533
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,950
channels through a fully connected layer
and then take a soft max.

1534
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:52,960
and then take a soft max.
 

1535
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,829
and then take a soft max.
Okay, so this is the kind of perspective

1536
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:55,839
Okay, so this is the kind of perspective
 

1537
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,510
Okay, so this is the kind of perspective
of getting rid of the large MLP at the

1538
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,520
of getting rid of the large MLP at the
 

1539
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,950
of getting rid of the large MLP at the
end. So all of the MLP like work is

1540
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:00,960
end. So all of the MLP like work is
 

1541
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,670
end. So all of the MLP like work is
being done by these one by one cons uh

1542
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:03,680
being done by these one by one cons uh
 

1543
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,270
being done by these one by one cons uh
throughout.

1544
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:07,280

 

1545
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,510

Okay. So this is like how people did it

1546
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,520
Okay. So this is like how people did it
 

1547
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,829
Okay. So this is like how people did it
for imageet. But there's a question if

1548
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:13,839
for imageet. But there's a question if
 

1549
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,310
for imageet. But there's a question if
you have a block that wants to include

1550
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:16,320
you have a block that wants to include
 

1551
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,870
you have a block that wants to include
something that's a downsampling like a

1552
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:18,880
something that's a downsampling like a
 

1553
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,829
something that's a downsampling like a
max pool or something with stride what

1554
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:21,839
max pool or something with stride what
 

1555
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,990
max pool or something with stride what
do you do? So I say what do you mean

1556
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,000
do you do? So I say what do you mean
 

1557
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,870
do you do? So I say what do you mean
what do you do? You do the same thing

1558
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:24,880
what do you do? You do the same thing
 

1559
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,750
what do you do? You do the same thing
you always do. So here I'll show you a

1560
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:27,760
you always do. So here I'll show you a
 

1561
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,589
you always do. So here I'll show you a
picture. Suppose you came in with a 100

1562
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
picture. Suppose you came in with a 100
 

1563
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,069
picture. Suppose you came in with a 100
by 100 image and it has 32 channels.

1564
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:36,079
by 100 image and it has 32 channels.
 

1565
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,750
by 100 image and it has 32 channels.
That's what this thing is. Then there's

1566
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:37,760
That's what this thing is. Then there's
 

1567
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,630
That's what this thing is. Then there's
a box, a block. This block includes

1568
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:40,640
a box, a block. This block includes
 

1569
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,630
a box, a block. This block includes
things like a max pool, stride,

1570
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:42,640
things like a max pool, stride,
 

1571
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,710
things like a max pool, stride,
something that makes a down sample. So

1572
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:44,720
something that makes a down sample. So
 

1573
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,109
something that makes a down sample. So
the output of this is a 50 by 50 image

1574
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:47,119
the output of this is a 50 by 50 image
 

1575
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,190
the output of this is a 50 by 50 image
with 50 channels. Let's say I just make

1576
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,200
with 50 channels. Let's say I just make
 

1577
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,430
with 50 channels. Let's say I just make
these numbers up.

1578
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:51,440
these numbers up.
 

1579
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,510
these numbers up.
So now I want to have a skip connection.

1580
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:55,520

 

1581
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,430

Does everyone see? This is what you want

1582
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,440
Does everyone see? This is what you want
 

1583
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:04,630
Does everyone see? This is what you want
to do. So, can I do this?

1584
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:04,640

 

1585
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,390

Maybe everyone take a minute, talk to

1586
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,400
Maybe everyone take a minute, talk to
 

1587
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,390
Maybe everyone take a minute, talk to
your neighbors and think about this.

1588
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:08,400
your neighbors and think about this.
 

1589
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,310
your neighbors and think about this.
This is important for you to It's like a

1590
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:10,320
This is important for you to It's like a
 

1591
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,430
This is important for you to It's like a
test of whether you understand what's

1592
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:11,440

1595
00:36:34,320 --> 00:37:12,860

pretty good.

1596

Okay. So, interest of time, I want to

1600
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:20,480
Okay. So, interest of time, I want to
 

1601
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,870
Okay. So, interest of time, I want to
pull everyone back together. So,

1602
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
pull everyone back together. So,
 

1603
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,510
pull everyone back together. So,
first, can anyone tell me if I just add

1604
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:27,520
first, can anyone tell me if I just add
 

1605
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,310
first, can anyone tell me if I just add
this as a plus? What will happen?

something that's 100 by 32 to something
 

1611
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,069
something that's 100 by 32 to something
that's 50/50 by 50. It just doesn't

1612
00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:40,079
that's 50/50 by 50. It just doesn't
 

1613
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,310
that's 50/50 by 50. It just doesn't
work. They're wrong shapes. They don't

1614
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:42,320
work. They're wrong shapes. They don't
 

1615
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,670
work. They're wrong shapes. They don't
add. In fact, there's different numbers

1616
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:43,680
add. In fact, there's different numbers
 

1617
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,349
add. In fact, there's different numbers
of things in there even. So, you can't

1618
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:47,359
of things in there even. So, you can't
 

1619
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,190
of things in there even. So, you can't
do that.

1620
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
do that.
 

1621
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,510
do that.
So,

1622
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:51,520
So,
 

1623
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,030
So,
first thought might be this is just

1624
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,040
first thought might be this is just
 

1625
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,870
first thought might be this is just
broken. Like you're dead, right? You

1626
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:56,880
broken. Like you're dead, right? You
 

1627
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,470
broken. Like you're dead, right? You
just can't do it. So, you have to

1628
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:58,480
just can't do it. So, you have to
 

1629
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,430
just can't do it. So, you have to
remember what are you trying to do?

1630
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:01,440
remember what are you trying to do?
 

1631
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,390
remember what are you trying to do?
Your goal, remember, is to make sure the

1632
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:04,400
Your goal, remember, is to make sure the
 

1633
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,470
Your goal, remember, is to make sure the
gradient here can pass back in some

1634
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:08,480
gradient here can pass back in some
 

1635
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,950
gradient here can pass back in some
meaningful way back.

1636
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:10,960
meaningful way back.
 

1637
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,430
meaningful way back.
That's the goal. So you want to create a

1638
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:13,440
That's the goal. So you want to create a
 

1639
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,589
That's the goal. So you want to create a
path for the gradient.

1640
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:15,599
path for the gradient.
 

1641
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,190
path for the gradient.
Now

1642
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,200
Now
 

1643
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,910
Now
the gradient at this point, right, is 50

1644
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:19,920
the gradient at this point, right, is 50
 

1645
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,109
the gradient at this point, right, is 50
by 50 by 50.

1646
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:23,119
by 50 by 50.
 

1647
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,790
by 50 by 50.
So it's not going to pass directly

1648
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800
So it's not going to pass directly
 

1649
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,190
So it's not going to pass directly
through over here.

1650
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:27,200
through over here.
 

1651
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,390
through over here.
So what can we do?

1652
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:30,400
So what can we do?
 

1653
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,069
So what can we do?
What do we what's the minimal thing we

1654
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:32,079
What do we what's the minimal thing we
 

1655
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:39,990
What do we what's the minimal thing we
need to do?

1656
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000

 

1657

1663
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,870

Okay. So, I need something that changes

1664
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:04,880
Okay. So, I need something that changes
 

1665
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,150
Okay. So, I need something that changes
the shape. So,

1666
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,160
the shape. So,
 

1667
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,790
the shape. So,
what is an example of something that can

1668
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:10,800
what is an example of something that can
 

1669
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,030
what is an example of something that can
change the shape for me?

1670
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,040

 

1671
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,670

>> Yeah.

1672
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:15,680
>> Yeah.
 

1673
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,910
>> Yeah.
>> Down the image.

1674
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:17,920
>> Down the image.
 

1675
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,670
>> Down the image.
>> Down sampling the image. But it's

1676
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:19,680
>> Down sampling the image. But it's
 

1677
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,030
>> Down sampling the image. But it's
happening inside of here. There's some

1678
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,040
happening inside of here. There's some
 

1679
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,829
happening inside of here. There's some
downsampling happening inside of here.

1680
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:23,839
downsampling happening inside of here.
 

1681
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,430
downsampling happening inside of here.
So remember, when you downsample the

1682
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,440
So remember, when you downsample the
 

1683
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,750
So remember, when you downsample the
image, typically you're downsampling by

1684
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:27,760
image, typically you're downsampling by
 

1685
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,270
image, typically you're downsampling by
using a max pull or a stride, but you're

1686
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:29,280
using a max pull or a stride, but you're
 

1687
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,390
using a max pull or a stride, but you're
typically also increasing the channels.

1688
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,400
typically also increasing the channels.
 

1689
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,150
typically also increasing the channels.
So it need not be the case that there's

1690
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,160
So it need not be the case that there's
 

1691
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,589
So it need not be the case that there's
fewer things on the outside than there

1692
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:35,599
fewer things on the outside than there
 

1693
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,910
fewer things on the outside than there
are on the inside. Here there are, but

1694
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:37,920
are on the inside. Here there are, but
 

1695
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,510
are on the inside. Here there are, but
that doesn't have to be the case. It

1696
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:39,520
that doesn't have to be the case. It
 

1697
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,069
that doesn't have to be the case. It
could be there's more things here.

1698
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:46,079

 

1699
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,750

Just think from the perspective of the

1700
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:47,760
Just think from the perspective of the
 

1701
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,550
Just think from the perspective of the
mathematics of it. You need some object

1702
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:50,560
mathematics of it. You need some object
 

1703
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,630
mathematics of it. You need some object
that'll change the shape. What's the

1704
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:52,640
that'll change the shape. What's the
 

1705

that'll change the shape. What's the
simplest object you know that will

simplest object you know that will
 

1707

simplest object you know that will
change the shape?

Okay, so it's called this linear like P.

Oops.
And it turns out one solution is simply

1726
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,040
And it turns out one solution is simply
 

1727
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,310
And it turns out one solution is simply
to add a learnable P matrix. So remember

1728
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:44,320
to add a learnable P matrix. So remember
 

1729
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,030
to add a learnable P matrix. So remember
what's the deep learning rule, right? I

going backwards. That's what you want to
do. It's a gradient path and

1752
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:17,680
do. It's a gradient path and
 

1753
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,950
do. It's a gradient path and
just let it learn. Okay, that's a valid

1754
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:20,960
just let it learn. Okay, that's a valid
 

1755
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,550
just let it learn. Okay, that's a valid
solution. Yeah.

1756
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:22,560
solution. Yeah.
 

1757
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,790
solution. Yeah.
>> Are we sharing across the connection?

1758
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:26,800
>> Are we sharing across the connection?
 

1759
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,710
>> Are we sharing across the connection?
>> Great question. Are you sharing the P

1760
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:28,720
>> Great question. Are you sharing the P
 

1761
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,030
>> Great question. Are you sharing the P
across the depth of uh skip connections?

1762
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,040
across the depth of uh skip connections?
 

1763
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,230
across the depth of uh skip connections?
And the answer is if you make them

1764
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,240
And the answer is if you make them
 

1765
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,430
And the answer is if you make them
learnable parameters, you do not have

1766
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:33,440
learnable parameters, you do not have
 

1767
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,790
learnable parameters, you do not have
to. People have done both things. In

1768
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:36,800
to. People have done both things. In
 

1769
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,670
to. People have done both things. In
fact, people found that and the res the

1770
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:39,680
fact, people found that and the res the
 

1771
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,430
fact, people found that and the res the
first ResNet paper didn't even make it

1772
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,440
first ResNet paper didn't even make it
 

1773
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,109
first ResNet paper didn't even make it
learnable. It just says I will pick a

1774
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:43,119
learnable. It just says I will pick a
 

1775
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,270
learnable. It just says I will pick a
matrix. So for example, if I'm

1776
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:45,280
matrix. So for example, if I'm
 

1777
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,910
matrix. So for example, if I'm
downsampling, one way of doing it is to

1778
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:47,920
downsampling, one way of doing it is to
 

1779
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,230
downsampling, one way of doing it is to
say if I'm downsampling uh in 4x4

1780
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,240
say if I'm downsampling uh in 4x4
 

1781
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,990
say if I'm downsampling uh in 4x4
blocks, which is what this is, like back

1782
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,000
blocks, which is what this is, like back
 

1783
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,109
blocks, which is what this is, like back
by a factor of two, I'll just put an

1784
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
by a factor of two, I'll just put an
 

1785
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,270
by a factor of two, I'll just put an
average

1786
00:41:59,270 --> 00:41:59,280
average
 

1787
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,710
average
across the block for this matrix. If I

1788
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:02,720
across the block for this matrix. If I
 

1789
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,510
across the block for this matrix. If I
had 32 channels here, I will have that

1790
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:05,520
had 32 channels here, I will have that
 

1791
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,510
had 32 channels here, I will have that
average go over to the first 32 channels

1792
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:07,520
average go over to the first 32 channels
 

1793
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,750
average go over to the first 32 channels
here, and I'll just set the others to

1794
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:09,760
here, and I'll just set the others to
 

1795
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,670
here, and I'll just set the others to
zero.

1796
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:11,680
zero.
 

1797
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,589
zero.
So what that means is that the gradients

1798
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
So what that means is that the gradients
 

1799
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,750
So what that means is that the gradients
on those channels stop here. They won't

1800
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:15,760
on those channels stop here. They won't
 

1801
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,750
on those channels stop here. They won't
go back.

1802
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:17,760
go back.
 

1803
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,109
go back.
But the gradients on the first ones will

1804
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:19,119
But the gradients on the first ones will
 

1805
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,190
But the gradients on the first ones will
go back. That also works.

1806
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,200
go back. That also works.
 

1807
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,710
go back. That also works.
So people have experimented and for

1808
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
So people have experimented and for
 

1809
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,910
So people have experimented and for
different applications have different

1810
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
different applications have different
 

1811
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,150
different applications have different
choices of what they do. But the

1812
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,160
choices of what they do. But the
 

1813
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,430
choices of what they do. But the
important thing to understand here is

1814
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,440
important thing to understand here is
 

1815
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,829
important thing to understand here is
you have to do something.

1816
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:31,839
you have to do something.
 

1817
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,470
you have to do something.
You can't do nothing.

1818
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:34,480
You can't do nothing.
 

1819
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,150
You can't do nothing.
Okay? Because if you did nothing, you

1820
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,160
Okay? Because if you did nothing, you
 

1821
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,829
Okay? Because if you did nothing, you
didn't put the skip at all, you would

1822
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:37,839
didn't put the skip at all, you would
 

1823
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,550
didn't put the skip at all, you would
lose the gradients going backwards.

1824
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:40,560
lose the gradients going backwards.
 

1825
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,990
lose the gradients going backwards.
you'd lose the gradient super highway to

1826
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,000
you'd lose the gradient super highway to
 

1827
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,150
you'd lose the gradient super highway to
stop there.

1828
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
stop there.
 

1829
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,870
stop there.
Okay, so discussion will talk a little

1830
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:46,880
Okay, so discussion will talk a little
 

1831
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,990
Okay, so discussion will talk a little
bit more about this just to make sure

1832
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,000
bit more about this just to make sure
 

1833
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,069
bit more about this just to make sure
everyone gets it but it's an important

1834
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:50,079
everyone gets it but it's an important
 

1835
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,270
everyone gets it but it's an important
uh point for resonance.

1836
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,280
uh point for resonance.
 

1837
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,670
uh point for resonance.
Okay, so I want to move uh move on.

1838
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:57,680
Okay, so I want to move uh move on.
 

1839
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,470
Okay, so I want to move uh move on.
So this all this perspective was

1840
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:02,480
So this all this perspective was
 

1841
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,829
So this all this perspective was
uh you know if you look at the uh these

1842
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:05,839
uh you know if you look at the uh these
 

1843
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,910
uh you know if you look at the uh these
papers these are all like you know

1844
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
papers these are all like you know
 

1845
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,349
papers these are all like you know
resnet I believe came out in 2015 uh and

1846
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:11,359
resnet I believe came out in 2015 uh and
 

1847
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,270
resnet I believe came out in 2015 uh and
so this is you know all at that time

1848
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,280
so this is you know all at that time
 

1849
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,790
so this is you know all at that time
period

1850
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:14,800
period
 

1851
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,910
period
uh was the the next in the first in the

1852
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:17,920
uh was the the next in the first in the
 

1853
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,550
uh was the the next in the first in the
beginning of the modern age of neural

1854
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:20,560
beginning of the modern age of neural
 

1855
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,109
beginning of the modern age of neural
nets it was the first large

1856
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:23,119
nets it was the first large
 

1857
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,710
nets it was the first large
architectural advance that hadn't been

1858
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:24,720
architectural advance that hadn't been
 

1859
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,550
architectural advance that hadn't been
there before was was the residual

1860
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:26,560
there before was was the residual
 

1861
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,790
there before was was the residual
connections

1862
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:28,800
connections
 

1863
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,470
connections
Um and then people you know kept looking

1864
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,480
Um and then people you know kept looking
 

1865
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,230
Um and then people you know kept looking
at this and historical perspective is in

1866
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:36,240
at this and historical perspective is in
 

1867
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,069
at this and historical perspective is in
2017 uh transformers came out. uh people

1868
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:40,079
2017 uh transformers came out. uh people
 

1869
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,630
2017 uh transformers came out. uh people
started applying them to vision in 2018

1870
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:42,640
started applying them to vision in 2018
 

1871
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,309
started applying them to vision in 2018
2019 and by that time frame they were

1872
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:46,319
2019 and by that time frame they were
 

1873
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,470
2019 and by that time frame they were
really in many problems beating the uh

1874
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:50,480
really in many problems beating the uh
 

1875
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,109
really in many problems beating the uh
old connet architecture and so people

1876
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:53,119
old connet architecture and so people
 

1877
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,309
old connet architecture and so people
took a look again and said

1878
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:56,319
took a look again and said
 

1879
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,589
took a look again and said
is this because we are there's something

1880
00:43:59,589 --> 00:43:59,599
is this because we are there's something
 

1881
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,270
is this because we are there's something
fundamentally better about what's inside

1882
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:01,280
fundamentally better about what's inside
 

1883
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,390
fundamentally better about what's inside
transformers which we'll talk about

1884
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,400
transformers which we'll talk about
 

1885
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,750
transformers which we'll talk about
later um or were we not doing connets

1886
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
later um or were we not doing connets
 

1887
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,990
later um or were we not doing connets
correctly and there's a really nice

1888
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
correctly and there's a really nice
 

1889
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,670
correctly and there's a really nice
paper which is a connet for the 2020s uh

1890
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:11,680
paper which is a connet for the 2020s uh
 

1891
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,109
paper which is a connet for the 2020s uh
by lead which came out in 2022. It's

1892
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:15,119
by lead which came out in 2022. It's
 

1893
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,710
by lead which came out in 2022. It's
actually a collaboration between

1894
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:16,720
actually a collaboration between
 

1895
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,829
actually a collaboration between
metaphair was called despair then um and

1896
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:19,839
metaphair was called despair then um and
 

1897
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,550
metaphair was called despair then um and
Berkeley and they proposed an

1898
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,560
Berkeley and they proposed an
 

1899
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,190
Berkeley and they proposed an
architecture they called con next

1900
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:25,200
architecture they called con next
 

1901
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,670
architecture they called con next
generation connet.

1902
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:27,680
generation connet.
 

1903
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,190
generation connet.
So this is useful to talk about like

1904
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,200
So this is useful to talk about like
 

1905
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,750
So this is useful to talk about like
what what things are happening here uh

1906
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:31,760
what what things are happening here uh
 

1907
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,550
what what things are happening here uh
introduce a couple more concepts.

1908
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:34,560
introduce a couple more concepts.
 

1909
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,950
introduce a couple more concepts.
So they went through and it's actually a

1910
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:36,960
So they went through and it's actually a
 

1911
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,710
So they went through and it's actually a
beautiful paper to read. I recommend you

1912
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:38,720
beautiful paper to read. I recommend you
 

1913
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,910
beautiful paper to read. I recommend you
look at it as a way to understand how to

1914
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
look at it as a way to understand how to
 

1915
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,670
look at it as a way to understand how to
think systematically about architectural

1916
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:43,680
think systematically about architectural
 

1917
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,270
think systematically about architectural
experimentation.

1918
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:45,280
experimentation.
 

1919
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,950
experimentation.
And so they really took everything and

1920
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:46,960
And so they really took everything and
 

1921
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,630
And so they really took everything and
they broke it out into pieces and says

1922
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,640
they broke it out into pieces and says
 

1923
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,030
they broke it out into pieces and says
what can I play with? What can I adjust?

1924
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,040
what can I play with? What can I adjust?
 

1925
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,230
what can I play with? What can I adjust?
How can I explore these different

1926
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:52,240
How can I explore these different
 

1927
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,910
How can I explore these different
things? What's really important? What's

1928
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:53,920
things? What's really important? What's
 

1929
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,390
things? What's really important? What's
not important? So it's a fun paper to

1930
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,400
not important? So it's a fun paper to
 

1931
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,670
not important? So it's a fun paper to
read and understand kind of from a

1932
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:57,680
read and understand kind of from a
 

1933
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,030
read and understand kind of from a
perspective point of view.

1934
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:01,040
perspective point of view.
 

1935
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,990
perspective point of view.
And so the original ResNet blocks look

1936
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,000
And so the original ResNet blocks look
 

1937
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,589
And so the original ResNet blocks look
like this that people after much

1938
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:05,599
like this that people after much
 

1939
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,950
like this that people after much
iteration, right? Uh, and what they did

1940
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:08,960
iteration, right? Uh, and what they did
 

1941
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,710
iteration, right? Uh, and what they did
was they said, "Well, I'm going to start

1942
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:10,720
was they said, "Well, I'm going to start
 

1943
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,309
was they said, "Well, I'm going to start
with 256 channels, for example,

1944
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:14,319
with 256 channels, for example,
 

1945
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,390
with 256 channels, for example,
and the first thing I'm going to do is a

1946
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:16,400
and the first thing I'm going to do is a
 

1947
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,950
and the first thing I'm going to do is a
one by one con that turns those 256

1948
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:18,960
one by one con that turns those 256
 

1949
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,829
one by one con that turns those 256
channels into 64 channels. Then there'll

1950
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:21,839
channels into 64 channels. Then there'll
 

1951
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,670
channels into 64 channels. Then there'll
be a batchorm and array luminal

1952
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
be a batchorm and array luminal
 

1953
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,270
be a batchorm and array luminal
linearity.

1954
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:25,280
linearity.
 

1955
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,550
linearity.
Then there will be a 3x3 con

1956
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:30,560
Then there will be a 3x3 con
 

1957
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,750
Then there will be a 3x3 con
with the same 64 channels. And then I'll

1958
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:33,760
with the same 64 channels. And then I'll
 

1959
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,349
with the same 64 channels. And then I'll
have another batch norm and

1960
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:35,359
have another batch norm and
 

1961
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,910
have another batch norm and
nonlinearity. And then I'll expand back

1962
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:37,920
nonlinearity. And then I'll expand back
 

1963
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,230
nonlinearity. And then I'll expand back
out using a one by one con 5 to 256. And

1964
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:40,240
out using a one by one con 5 to 256. And
 

1965
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,230
out using a one by one con 5 to 256. And
I'll put another batch norm. Then I'll

1966
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,240
I'll put another batch norm. Then I'll
 

1967
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,150
I'll put another batch norm. Then I'll
add the I'll actually add the skip and

1968
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,160
add the I'll actually add the skip and
 

1969
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,589
add the I'll actually add the skip and
then put the relu after.

1970
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:47,599
then put the relu after.
 

1971
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,349
then put the relu after.
Okay, this is the way that people used

1972
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:49,359
Okay, this is the way that people used
 

1973
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,589
Okay, this is the way that people used
to do things.

1974
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:51,599
to do things.
 

1975
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,390
to do things.
And

1976
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:54,400
And
 

1977
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,710
And
what they said was

1978
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:56,720
what they said was
 

1979
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,829
what they said was
you can do better than doing this. And

1980
00:45:59,829 --> 00:45:59,839
you can do better than doing this. And
 

1981
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,950
you can do better than doing this. And
this has so remember we said at the very

1982
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:02,960
this has so remember we said at the very
 

1983
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,589
this has so remember we said at the very
beginning deep learning is there's lots

1984
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:05,599
beginning deep learning is there's lots
 

1985
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,390
beginning deep learning is there's lots
of freedom and so there is a bit of

1986
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,400
of freedom and so there is a bit of
 

1987
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,510
of freedom and so there is a bit of
pragmatic superstition that is useful

1988
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
pragmatic superstition that is useful
 

1989
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,750
pragmatic superstition that is useful
which is if you don't know why someone

1990
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:13,760
which is if you don't know why someone
 

1991
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,190
which is if you don't know why someone
did something just do the same thing

1992
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,200
did something just do the same thing
 

1993
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,829
did something just do the same thing
they're doing right you don't have to

1994
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
they're doing right you don't have to
 

1995
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,470
they're doing right you don't have to
understand everything you have to but

1996
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:20,480
understand everything you have to but
 

1997
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,309
understand everything you have to but
it's better to copy something else that

1998
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:22,319
it's better to copy something else that
 

1999
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,630
it's better to copy something else that
worked and change a little bit than to

2000
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:24,640
worked and change a little bit than to
 

2001
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,470
worked and change a little bit than to
try to do it from scratch because you

2002
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:26,480
try to do it from scratch because you
 

2003
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,390
try to do it from scratch because you
don't know why things work. Okay, this

2004
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,400
don't know why things work. Okay, this
 

2005
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,870
don't know why things work. Okay, this
is a kind of superstitious perspective

2006
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:30,880
is a kind of superstitious perspective
 

2007
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,790
is a kind of superstitious perspective
on deep learning, but people kept doing

2008
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
on deep learning, but people kept doing
 

2009
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,430
on deep learning, but people kept doing
it. And then they said maybe a lot of

2010
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:35,440
it. And then they said maybe a lot of
 

2011
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,950
it. And then they said maybe a lot of
these things are just happening because

2012
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:36,960
these things are just happening because
 

2013
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,470
these things are just happening because
people are doing them over and over

2014
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,480
people are doing them over and over
 

2015
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,710
people are doing them over and over
again and you don't need them and they

2016
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:40,720
again and you don't need them and they
 

2017
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,870
again and you don't need them and they
actually might be making things worse.

2018
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
actually might be making things worse.
 

2019
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,870
actually might be making things worse.
So the old style of thinking about

2020
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
So the old style of thinking about
 

2021
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,910
So the old style of thinking about
neural nets was very much fixated on

2022
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:47,920
neural nets was very much fixated on
 

2023
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,630
neural nets was very much fixated on
well you have some like you know they

2024
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:50,640
well you have some like you know they
 

2025
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,470
well you have some like you know they
use biological language you have some

2026
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:52,480
use biological language you have some
 

2027
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,309
use biological language you have some
synapse-like thing which is like some

2028
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:54,319
synapse-like thing which is like some
 

2029
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,150
synapse-like thing which is like some
weights multiplying stuff and then

2030
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:56,160
weights multiplying stuff and then
 

2031
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,670
weights multiplying stuff and then
there's an activation function and

2032
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:57,680
there's an activation function and
 

2033
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,390
there's an activation function and
there's a bias and then repeats so this

2034
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:00,400
there's a bias and then repeats so this
 

2035
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,349
there's a bias and then repeats so this
like ritualistic putting of the

2036
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:03,359
like ritualistic putting of the
 

2037
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,670
like ritualistic putting of the
nonlinearity everywhere

2038
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:05,680
nonlinearity everywhere
 

2039
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,390
nonlinearity everywhere
and they said maybe I don't need that

2040
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:08,400
and they said maybe I don't need that
 

2041
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,230
and they said maybe I don't need that
and what this one of the big shifts they

2042
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:10,240
and what this one of the big shifts they
 

2043
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,390
and what this one of the big shifts they
did was they said I'll have a linear

2044
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:12,400
did was they said I'll have a linear
 

2045
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,829
did was they said I'll have a linear
operation here. I'll have a linear

2046
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:15,839
operation here. I'll have a linear
 

2047
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,750
operation here. I'll have a linear
operations here and I'll put only one

2048
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:17,760
operations here and I'll put only one
 

2049
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,190
operations here and I'll put only one
nonlinearity inside this box.

2050
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,200
nonlinearity inside this box.
 

2051
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,870
nonlinearity inside this box.
Okay, actually there's two. There's the

2052
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:22,880
Okay, actually there's two. There's the
 

2053
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,710
Okay, actually there's two. There's the
nonlinearity from the normalization and

2054
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:24,720
nonlinearity from the normalization and
 

2055
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,109
nonlinearity from the normalization and
there's a nonlinearity in here. But

2056
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:27,119
there's a nonlinearity in here. But
 

2057
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,790
there's a nonlinearity in here. But
that's I'm not going to have

2058
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:28,800
that's I'm not going to have
 

2059
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,349
that's I'm not going to have
nonlinearities everywhere and I'm not

2060
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:31,359
nonlinearities everywhere and I'm not
 

2061
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,750
nonlinearities everywhere and I'm not
going to use batch norms and rails

2062
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:33,760
going to use batch norms and rails
 

2063
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,190
going to use batch norms and rails
everywhere. That's like one shift they

2064
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,200
everywhere. That's like one shift they
 

2065
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,589
everywhere. That's like one shift they
did and this improved performance. This

2066
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:37,599
did and this improved performance. This
 

2067
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,829
did and this improved performance. This
is a big a big source of performance

2068
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:39,839
is a big a big source of performance
 

2069
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,630
is a big a big source of performance
improvement. Not the choice of gay

2070
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:42,640
improvement. Not the choice of gay
 

2071
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,309
improvement. Not the choice of gay
versus relu. This is an excuse so I can

2072
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:44,319
versus relu. This is an excuse so I can
 

2073
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,470
versus relu. This is an excuse so I can
show you what this one is. But uh that's

2074
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:46,480
show you what this one is. But uh that's
 

2075
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,910
show you what this one is. But uh that's
not a big deal. But the having an linear

2076
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:49,920
not a big deal. But the having an linear
 

2077
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,670
not a big deal. But the having an linear
one place that was useful and having the

2078
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:53,680
one place that was useful and having the
 

2079
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,870
one place that was useful and having the
layer norm early was useful.

2080
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:58,880

 

2081
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,589

Okay. Next thing

2082
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:01,599
Okay. Next thing
 

2083
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,309
Okay. Next thing
uh they did was they said they looked at

2084
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:04,319
uh they did was they said they looked at
 

2085
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,950
uh they did was they said they looked at
the parameter counts involved and they

2086
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:06,960
the parameter counts involved and they
 

2087
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,870
the parameter counts involved and they
said it's actually better if I

2088
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:10,880
said it's actually better if I
 

2089
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,950
said it's actually better if I
instead of going from large number of

2090
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:12,960
instead of going from large number of
 

2091
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,390
instead of going from large number of
channels to a small number of channels

2092
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,400
channels to a small number of channels
 

2093
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,790
channels to a small number of channels
and then going back to a large number of

2094
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:18,800
and then going back to a large number of
 

2095
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,950
and then going back to a large number of
channels. This is this evolved but in

2096
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:22,960
channels. This is this evolved but in
 

2097
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,510
channels. This is this evolved but in
hindsight is a bit strange right because

2098
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:25,520
hindsight is a bit strange right because
 

2099
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,030
hindsight is a bit strange right because
remember when you were doing the example

2100
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,040
remember when you were doing the example
 

2101
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,589
remember when you were doing the example
with the elbows and the relus

2102
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:31,599
with the elbows and the relus
 

2103
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,109
with the elbows and the relus
having lots of things in the hidden

2104
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:33,119
having lots of things in the hidden
 

2105
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,069
having lots of things in the hidden
layer increases expressive power

2106
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:36,079
layer increases expressive power
 

2107
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,910
layer increases expressive power
right and folding it back so this is

2108
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:37,920
right and folding it back so this is
 

2109
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,109
right and folding it back so this is
saying look let's let's do the same

2110
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:39,119
saying look let's let's do the same
 

2111
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,069
saying look let's let's do the same
thing here let's have 96 channels and

2112
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:42,079
thing here let's have 96 channels and
 

2113
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,710
thing here let's have 96 channels and
then let's expand out and do to 384

2114
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:46,720
then let's expand out and do to 384
 

2115
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,030
then let's expand out and do to 384
think of this adding a lot more features

2116
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:49,040
think of this adding a lot more features
 

2117
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,270
think of this adding a lot more features
and then go through nine linearities and

2118
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:51,280
and then go through nine linearities and
 

2119
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,589
and then go through nine linearities and
then let's come back down.

2120
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:53,599
then let's come back down.
 

2121
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,790
then let's come back down.
Let's do it this way. And this saves uh

2122
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:56,800
Let's do it this way. And this saves uh
 

2123
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,510
Let's do it this way. And this saves uh
parameters also overall matches the

2124
00:48:59,510 --> 00:48:59,520
parameters also overall matches the
 

2125
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,470
parameters also overall matches the
parameters basically.

2126
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:02,480
parameters basically.
 

2127
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,910
parameters basically.
Second thing they said is that look a 64

2128
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:05,920
Second thing they said is that look a 64
 

2129
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,510
Second thing they said is that look a 64
channel

2130
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:07,520
channel
 

2131
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,910
channel
uh traditional con has this 3x3 has lots

2132
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:11,920
uh traditional con has this 3x3 has lots
 

2133
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,589
uh traditional con has this 3x3 has lots
of parameters because you're actually

2134
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:13,599
of parameters because you're actually
 

2135
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,910
of parameters because you're actually
adding stuff together from all the

2136
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:15,920
adding stuff together from all the
 

2137
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,670
adding stuff together from all the
channels to get the output for a given

2138
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:17,680
channels to get the output for a given
 

2139
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,030
channels to get the output for a given
channel. A traditional con remember does

2140
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,040
channel. A traditional con remember does
 

2141
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,109
channel. A traditional con remember does
cons at every channel and then adds them

2142
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:23,119
cons at every channel and then adds them
 

2143
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,030
cons at every channel and then adds them
up to get you for a particular channel.

2144
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:27,040
up to get you for a particular channel.
 

2145
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,470
up to get you for a particular channel.
They switched to something called a

2146
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:28,480
They switched to something called a
 

2147
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,349
They switched to something called a
depthwise convolution which says treat

2148
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:31,359
depthwise convolution which says treat
 

2149
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,150
depthwise convolution which says treat
every channel as though it's its own

2150
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:34,160
every channel as though it's its own
 

2151
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,710
every channel as though it's its own
channel. Have a single con for that

2152
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:36,720
channel. Have a single con for that
 

2153
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,510
channel. Have a single con for that
channel. Make it a 7 by7 con. Do that

2154
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:39,520
channel. Make it a 7 by7 con. Do that
 

2155
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,430
channel. Make it a 7 by7 con. Do that
for the 96 different channels but have

2156
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:41,440
for the 96 different channels but have
 

2157
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,390
for the 96 different channels but have
no interactions among these cons.

2158
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:44,400
no interactions among these cons.
 

2159
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,470
no interactions among these cons.
This is called a depthwise convolution.

2160
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
This is called a depthwise convolution.
 

2161
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,630
This is called a depthwise convolution.
So I have a picture below of a depthwise

2162
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:48,640
So I have a picture below of a depthwise
 

2163
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,950
So I have a picture below of a depthwise
convolution.

2164
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:52,960

 

2165
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,069

So here's a 5x5 depthwise convolution.

2166
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:56,079
So here's a 5x5 depthwise convolution.
 

2167
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,309
So here's a 5x5 depthwise convolution.
You just have suppose there were three

2168
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:58,319
You just have suppose there were three
 

2169
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,190
You just have suppose there were three
input channels as an example. You just

2170
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:01,200
input channels as an example. You just
 

2171
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,069
input channels as an example. You just
have a separate filter for this orange

2172
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:04,079
have a separate filter for this orange
 

2173
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,230
have a separate filter for this orange
channel, a different filter for the red

2174
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:06,240
channel, a different filter for the red
 

2175
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,710
channel, a different filter for the red
channel and a different filter for the

2176
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:08,720
channel and a different filter for the
 

2177
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,109
channel and a different filter for the
yellow channel. And you take the outputs

2178
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:11,119
yellow channel. And you take the outputs
 

2179
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,710
yellow channel. And you take the outputs
and get a new output. Is everyone clear

2180
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:14,720
and get a new output. Is everyone clear
 

2181
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,630
and get a new output. Is everyone clear
on a depthwise? It's just

2182
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:18,640
on a depthwise? It's just
 

2183
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,990
on a depthwise? It's just
the channels don't interact with each

2184
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,000
the channels don't interact with each
 

2185
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,829
the channels don't interact with each
other. You treat every channel you treat

2186
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:21,839
other. You treat every channel you treat
 

2187
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:22,950
other. You treat every channel you treat
all the cons as though there are one

2188
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:22,960
all the cons as though there are one
 

2189
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,670
all the cons as though there are one
channel in and one channel out con.

2190
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:25,680
channel in and one channel out con.
 

2191
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,150
channel in and one channel out con.
channel by channel. No weight sharing

2192
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,160
channel by channel. No weight sharing
 

2193
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,910
channel by channel. No weight sharing
across channels. Channels can have all

2194
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:29,920
across channels. Channels can have all
 

2195
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,549
across channels. Channels can have all
do their own thing, but

2196
00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:32,559
do their own thing, but
 

2197
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,109
do their own thing, but
uh as always, but you don't have any

2198
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:35,119
uh as always, but you don't have any
 

2199
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,750
uh as always, but you don't have any
interactions among channels. All the

2200
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:37,760
interactions among channels. All the
 

2201
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,670
interactions among channels. All the
interactions among channels happen from

2202
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:39,680
interactions among channels happen from
 

2203
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,870
interactions among channels happen from
the one by one.

2204
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:42,880
the one by one.
 

2205
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,710
the one by one.
And this helped because it saved a lot

2206
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:44,720
And this helped because it saved a lot
 

2207
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,109
And this helped because it saved a lot
of parameters here and they're able to

2208
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119
of parameters here and they're able to
 

2209
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,790
of parameters here and they're able to
use them to get more expressive power

2210
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:48,800
use them to get more expressive power
 

2211
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,510
use them to get more expressive power
here.

2212
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:51,520
here.
 

2213
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,150
here.
and then a minor shift from batch norm

2214
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,160
and then a minor shift from batch norm
 

2215
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,309
and then a minor shift from batch norm
to layer norm

2216
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:56,319
to layer norm
 

2217
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,069
to layer norm
and instead of having it three times

2218
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:58,079
and instead of having it three times
 

2219
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,309
and instead of having it three times
having it only one place early.

2220
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:02,319

 

2221
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,309

Okay. So what this

2222
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:06,319
Okay. So what this
 

2223
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,549
Okay. So what this
there's a couple of lessons of this one

2224
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:08,559
there's a couple of lessons of this one
 

2225
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,549
there's a couple of lessons of this one
is that

2226
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:10,559
is that
 

2227
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,790
is that
convolutional architectures

2228
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:12,800
convolutional architectures
 

2229
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,150
convolutional architectures
uh sometimes architectures aren't

2230
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,160
uh sometimes architectures aren't
 

2231
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,829
uh sometimes architectures aren't
actually the problem. there

2232
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:19,839
actually the problem. there
 

2233
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:22,549
actually the problem. there
you have to get the details right.

2234
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
you have to get the details right.
 

2235
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,710
you have to get the details right.
Right. So what they proved pretty

2236
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:24,720
Right. So what they proved pretty
 

2237
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,870
Right. So what they proved pretty
convincingly was that the it wasn't any

2238
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:28,880
convincingly was that the it wasn't any
 

2239
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,470
convincingly was that the it wasn't any
advantages of attention in transformers

2240
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:32,480
advantages of attention in transformers
 

2241
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,309
advantages of attention in transformers
relative to connets that were giving the

2242
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:34,319
relative to connets that were giving the
 

2243
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,990
relative to connets that were giving the
advantages. It was that the connets

2244
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:36,000
advantages. It was that the connets
 

2245
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,589
advantages. It was that the connets
weren't quite doing the right thing and

2246
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:37,599
weren't quite doing the right thing and
 

2247
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,510
weren't quite doing the right thing and
a better co net could be competitive and

2248
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:39,520
a better co net could be competitive and
 

2249
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,069
a better co net could be competitive and
beat uh the transformers

2250
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:42,079
beat uh the transformers
 

2251
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,710
beat uh the transformers
at that point. Um later on there's like

2252
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:44,720
at that point. Um later on there's like
 

2253
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,549
at that point. Um later on there's like
another follow- on paper that we'll

2254
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:46,559
another follow- on paper that we'll
 

2255
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,790
another follow- on paper that we'll
maybe mention later in the class that's

2256
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:48,800
maybe mention later in the class that's
 

2257
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,390
maybe mention later in the class that's
the con next 2.0 which was talking about

2258
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
the con next 2.0 which was talking about
 

2259
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,870
the con next 2.0 which was talking about
the next difference between how people

2260
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:54,880
the next difference between how people
 

2261
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,190
the next difference between how people
were using transform architectures and

2262
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:57,200
were using transform architectures and
 

2263
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,630
were using transform architectures and
connets which has to do with

2264
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:58,640
connets which has to do with
 

2265
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,630
connets which has to do with
pre-training but we will come to that

2266
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:00,640
pre-training but we will come to that
 

2267
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,710
pre-training but we will come to that
later. So this is the constant dialogue

2268
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:02,720
later. So this is the constant dialogue
 

2269
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,150
later. So this is the constant dialogue
what is actually important what's

2270
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,160
what is actually important what's
 

2271
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,030
what is actually important what's
actually giving you useful gains.

2272
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:07,040
actually giving you useful gains.
 

2273
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,630
actually giving you useful gains.
So this is the culling away of

2274
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,640
So this is the culling away of
 

2275
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,109
So this is the culling away of
superstitious accretion

2276
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:11,119
superstitious accretion
 

2277
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,710
superstitious accretion
uh that has happens in uh design.

2278
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:14,720
uh that has happens in uh design.
 

2279
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,910
uh that has happens in uh design.
So there's always these different

2280
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:15,920
So there's always these different
 

2281
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,790
So there's always these different
nonlinearities. Uh so Wikipedia has a

2282
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:18,800
nonlinearities. Uh so Wikipedia has a
 

2283
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,109
nonlinearities. Uh so Wikipedia has a
really nice article on the gel. You

2284
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:21,119
really nice article on the gel. You
 

2285
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,950
really nice article on the gel. You
should you can look at it if you want.

2286
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:22,960
should you can look at it if you want.
 

2287
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,829
should you can look at it if you want.
As a pictorially it just has the instead

2288
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:25,839
As a pictorially it just has the instead
 

2289
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,390
As a pictorially it just has the instead
of the relu it's like a smoother curve

2290
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:28,400
of the relu it's like a smoother curve
 

2291
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,230
of the relu it's like a smoother curve
but a bit weird looking um as a curve.

2292
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:32,240
but a bit weird looking um as a curve.
 

2293
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,870
but a bit weird looking um as a curve.
The actual equation for this curve is

2294
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:34,880
The actual equation for this curve is
 

2295
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:41,589
The actual equation for this curve is
the CDF of a Gaussian times the input.

2296
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:41,599
the CDF of a Gaussian times the input.
 

2297
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,790
the CDF of a Gaussian times the input.
Okay, so this is just uh what it is. And

2298
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:44,800
Okay, so this is just uh what it is. And
 

2299
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,790
Okay, so this is just uh what it is. And
sometimes because it is a little bit

2300
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:46,800
sometimes because it is a little bit
 

2301
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,030
sometimes because it is a little bit
smoother around here in some cases works

2302
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:49,040
smoother around here in some cases works
 

2303
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,030
smoother around here in some cases works
a little bit better

2304
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:51,040
a little bit better
 

2305
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,030
a little bit better
again. But in the comics paper, it's not

2306
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,040
again. But in the comics paper, it's not
 

2307
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,270
again. But in the comics paper, it's not
that it was a major source of

2308
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:55,280
that it was a major source of
 

2309
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,150
that it was a major source of
improvement. It's just uh is an excuse

2310
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:58,160
improvement. It's just uh is an excuse
 

2311
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,510
improvement. It's just uh is an excuse
to for me to show you another

2312
00:52:59,510 --> 00:52:59,520
to for me to show you another
 

2313
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,829
to for me to show you another
nonlinearity you should know about.

2314
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:03,839

 

2315
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:09,109

Okay. So now you know the kind of modern

2316
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
Okay. So now you know the kind of modern
 

2317
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,589
Okay. So now you know the kind of modern
uh connet uh picture. Um I want to sort

2318
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:13,599
uh connet uh picture. Um I want to sort
 

2319
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,309
uh connet uh picture. Um I want to sort
of talk a little bit about come back to

2320
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:16,319
of talk a little bit about come back to
 

2321
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,069
of talk a little bit about come back to
the issue of pooling because I want to

2322
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,079
the issue of pooling because I want to
 

2323
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,790
the issue of pooling because I want to
move on to how to think about problems

2324
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:20,800
move on to how to think about problems
 

2325
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,950
move on to how to think about problems
that are not uh is this image a dog?

2326
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:24,960
that are not uh is this image a dog?
 

2327
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,270
that are not uh is this image a dog?
Okay. Because if you saw again in the

2328
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,280
Okay. Because if you saw again in the
 

2329
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,390
Okay. Because if you saw again in the
ResNet picture I did here uh at the end

2330
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:30,400
ResNet picture I did here uh at the end
 

2331
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,430
ResNet picture I did here uh at the end
it did this global average pooling and

2332
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:33,440
it did this global average pooling and
 

2333
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,630
it did this global average pooling and
then it would give you an answer in

2334
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:34,640
then it would give you an answer in
 

2335
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,470
then it would give you an answer in
these thousand categories you know is it

2336
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,480
these thousand categories you know is it
 

2337
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,309
these thousand categories you know is it
a dog is it a cat is it an airplane or

2338
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:38,319
a dog is it a cat is it an airplane or
 

2339
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,150
a dog is it a cat is it an airplane or
so on but if you want to do more

2340
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:40,160
so on but if you want to do more
 

2341
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,589
so on but if you want to do more
interesting things like for example

2342
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:41,599
interesting things like for example
 

2343
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,510
interesting things like for example
label the pixels in an image this

2344
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:43,520
label the pixels in an image this
 

2345
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,910
label the pixels in an image this
doesn't work

2346
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:45,920
doesn't work
 

2347
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,430
doesn't work
and so one of the key things we're going

2348
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:47,440
and so one of the key things we're going
 

2349
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,470
and so one of the key things we're going
to need is we're going to need to be

2350
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:48,480
to need is we're going to need to be
 

2351
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,309
to need is we're going to need to be
able to

2352
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:50,319
able to
 

2353
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,270
able to
not just go down in resolution so that's

2354
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:53,280
not just go down in resolution so that's
 

2355
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,549
not just go down in resolution so that's
what I want to talk about

2356
00:53:58,549 --> 00:53:58,559

 

2357
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,430

Okay,

2358
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:03,440

 

2359
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,190

so first any questions on basic connets

2360
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:07,200
so first any questions on basic connets
 

2361
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,910
so first any questions on basic connets
for classification?

2362
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:09,920
for classification?
 

2363
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,670
for classification?
Now you know the all the basic building

2364
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
Now you know the all the basic building
 

2365
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,190
Now you know the all the basic building
blocks, normalization layers, blocks

2366
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:15,200
blocks, normalization layers, blocks
 

2367
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,870
blocks, normalization layers, blocks
that have skip connections on them and

2368
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:16,880
that have skip connections on them and
 

2369
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,390
that have skip connections on them and
how you place the normalization layers

2370
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:18,400
how you place the normalization layers
 

2371
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,309
how you place the normalization layers
inside the blocks near the beginning.

2372
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:22,319
inside the blocks near the beginning.
 

2373
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:26,150
inside the blocks near the beginning.
So if you remember pooling uh for down

2374
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
So if you remember pooling uh for down
 

2375
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,510
So if you remember pooling uh for down
basically how to do downsampling how to

2376
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:27,520
basically how to do downsampling how to
 

2377
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,430
basically how to do downsampling how to
make the resolution get smaller you had

2378
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:29,440
make the resolution get smaller you had
 

2379
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,910
make the resolution get smaller you had
three basic choices again this is figure

2380
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:31,920
three basic choices again this is figure
 

2381
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,230
three basic choices again this is figure
and prince you can do stride or

2382
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,240
and prince you can do stride or
 

2383
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,430
and prince you can do stride or
subsampling which is that you

2384
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:37,440
subsampling which is that you
 

2385
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,829
subsampling which is that you
take a little block and just pick the

2386
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:39,839
take a little block and just pick the
 

2387
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:43,589
take a little block and just pick the
first entry in the block as the output

2388
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:43,599
first entry in the block as the output
 

2389
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,030
first entry in the block as the output
and throw away all of these guys.

2390
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,040
and throw away all of these guys.
 

2391
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,790
and throw away all of these guys.
And then we told you that you could do

2392
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:48,800
And then we told you that you could do
 

2393
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,910
And then we told you that you could do
this in a more efficient manner by never

2394
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:51,920
this in a more efficient manner by never
 

2395
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,349
this in a more efficient manner by never
calculating these guys in the first

2396
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:53,359
calculating these guys in the first
 

2397
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,630
calculating these guys in the first
place. And that was a strided

2398
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:54,640
place. And that was a strided
 

2399
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,349
place. And that was a strided
convolution. Everyone remember?

2400
00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:57,359
convolution. Everyone remember?
 

2401
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,069
convolution. Everyone remember?
And then there's the idea of max pooling

2402
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:00,079
And then there's the idea of max pooling
 

2403
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,150
And then there's the idea of max pooling
which says in the block you actually

2404
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:02,160
which says in the block you actually
 

2405
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,910
which says in the block you actually
look at which one is the biggest and you

2406
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:05,920
look at which one is the biggest and you
 

2407
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,150
look at which one is the biggest and you
copy that over. So it could be different

2408
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:08,160
copy that over. So it could be different
 

2409
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,589
copy that over. So it could be different
entries. And we talked about how this

2410
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:09,599
entries. And we talked about how this
 

2411
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,309
entries. And we talked about how this
did gradient routing to the right spots

2412
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:12,319
did gradient routing to the right spots
 

2413
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,790
did gradient routing to the right spots
in the image.

2414
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:14,800
in the image.
 

2415
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,030
in the image.
And hopefully as you're doing the the

2416
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,040
And hopefully as you're doing the the
 

2417
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,790
And hopefully as you're doing the the
homework problem, you've done the

2418
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:18,800
homework problem, you've done the
 

2419
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,910
homework problem, you've done the
homework problem on uh what the

2420
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:21,920
homework problem on uh what the
 

2421
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,349
homework problem on uh what the
gradients look like, you see how what

2422
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:23,359
gradients look like, you see how what
 

2423
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,190
gradients look like, you see how what
this does is if you routed the

2424
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,200
this does is if you routed the
 

2425
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,710
this does is if you routed the
gradients, you're copying the right set

2426
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:26,720
gradients, you're copying the right set
 

2427
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,870
gradients, you're copying the right set
of things into the weights.

2428
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:28,880
of things into the weights.
 

2429
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,950
of things into the weights.
So if you were doing an edge detector

2430
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:30,960
So if you were doing an edge detector
 

2431
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,790
So if you were doing an edge detector
and there was actually an edge here,

2432
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:32,800
and there was actually an edge here,
 

2433
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,349
and there was actually an edge here,
you're going to copy like the edge like

2434
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:35,359
you're going to copy like the edge like
 

2435
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:36,950
you're going to copy like the edge like
behavior into the weights, which is what

2436
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:36,960
behavior into the weights, which is what
 

2437
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,030
behavior into the weights, which is what
you want. So this is the why back

2438
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:39,040
you want. So this is the why back
 

2439
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,670
you want. So this is the why back
pooling gives some advantages.

2440
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:41,680
pooling gives some advantages.
 

2441
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,030
pooling gives some advantages.
And then there's like average pooling,

2442
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,040
And then there's like average pooling,
 

2443
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,470
And then there's like average pooling,
mean pooling. It just takes the average.

2444
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:46,480
mean pooling. It just takes the average.
 

2445
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,349
mean pooling. It just takes the average.
Okay. So now the question is what if you

2446
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:49,359
Okay. So now the question is what if you
 

2447
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,910
Okay. So now the question is what if you
wanted to do the reverse? So each of

2448
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:51,920
wanted to do the reverse? So each of
 

2449
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,789
wanted to do the reverse? So each of
these takes you from high-res to low

2450
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:54,799
these takes you from high-res to low
 

2451
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,470
these takes you from high-res to low
res.

2452
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:56,480
res.
 

2453
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,789
res.
How do you go backwards?

2454
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
How do you go backwards?
 

2455
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,309
How do you go backwards?
If you wanted to go from low res to

2456
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:00,319
If you wanted to go from low res to
 

2457
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:01,990
If you wanted to go from low res to
high-res,

2458
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:02,000
high-res,
 

2459
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,510
high-res,
this is called upsampling.

2460
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:05,520

 

2461
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,390

So

2462
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:08,400
So
 

2463
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,829
So
let's think of two that are easy to

2464
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:09,839
let's think of two that are easy to
 

2465
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,470
let's think of two that are easy to
think about.

2466
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:12,480
think about.
 

2467
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,390
think about.
So you could imagine uh max unpool.

2468
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,400
So you could imagine uh max unpool.
 

2469
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:26,150
So you could imagine uh max unpool.
Okay. So max unpool would say

2470
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160

 

2471
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,309

I have a two, a four, a four, and an

2472
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:28,319
I have a two, a four, a four, and an
 

2473
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,870
I have a two, a four, a four, and an
eight. And suppose this is a big

2474
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:30,880
eight. And suppose this is a big
 

2475
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,870
eight. And suppose this is a big
suppose. Suppose I also remembered

2476
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880
suppose. Suppose I also remembered
 

2477
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,630
suppose. Suppose I also remembered
which spot these came from.

2478
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:38,640
which spot these came from.
 

2479
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,190
which spot these came from.
Okay. So I can for to do this I have to

2480
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,200
Okay. So I can for to do this I have to
 

2481
00:56:43,200 --> 00:57:05,750
Okay. So I can for to do this I have to
remember something.

2482
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:05,760

 

2483
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,190

Okay. If you remember which position was

2484
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:07,200
Okay. If you remember which position was
 

2485
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,430
Okay. If you remember which position was
the max, you could undo it.

2486
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:09,440
the max, you could undo it.
 

2487
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,230
the max, you could undo it.
But you have no information about the

2488
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,240
But you have no information about the
 

2489
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,870
But you have no information about the
other spots. Does everyone see that?

2490
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:14,880
other spots. Does everyone see that?
 

2491
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,750
other spots. Does everyone see that?
Like you only have the max. You don't

2492
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:17,760
Like you only have the max. You don't
 

2493
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,510
Like you only have the max. You don't
know which was the what the other was.

2494
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:19,520
know which was the what the other was.
 

2495
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,030
know which was the what the other was.
So you have to put something there. You

2496
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:21,040
So you have to put something there. You
 

2497
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,829
So you have to put something there. You
could put zeros. For example,

2498
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:23,839
could put zeros. For example,
 

2499
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,069
could put zeros. For example,
so it's like a max unpool. The easiest

2500
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:26,079
so it's like a max unpool. The easiest
 

2501
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,789
so it's like a max unpool. The easiest
one to understand is just duplication.

2502
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:28,799
one to understand is just duplication.
 

2503
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,349
one to understand is just duplication.
The opposite of a mean.

2504
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:31,359
The opposite of a mean.
 

2505
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,109
The opposite of a mean.
If you knew the average here in this

2506
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
If you knew the average here in this
 

2507
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,109
If you knew the average here in this
block was a two, what do you fill

2508
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:35,119
block was a two, what do you fill
 

2509
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,309
block was a two, what do you fill
everything in with twos?

2510
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:38,319
everything in with twos?
 

2511
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:44,549
everything in with twos?
Does everyone see that? Again, natural.

2512
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:44,559

 

2513
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,230

So,

2514
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:48,240

 

2515
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,430

what's the counterpart upsampling for

2516
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:51,440
what's the counterpart upsampling for
 

2517
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,390
what's the counterpart upsampling for
just subsampling? So, remember this

2518
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:54,400
just subsampling? So, remember this
 

2519
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,309
just subsampling? So, remember this
picture here?

2520
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:56,319
picture here?
 

2521
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:57,589
picture here?
What if you wanted to reverse that

2522
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:57,599
What if you wanted to reverse that
 

2523
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,670
What if you wanted to reverse that
picture?

2524
00:57:59,670 --> 00:57:59,680
picture?
 

2525
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,390
picture?
So, we're trying to reverse this one.

2526
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:04,400
So, we're trying to reverse this one.
 

2527
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,549
So, we're trying to reverse this one.
Okay,

2528
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:06,559
Okay,
 

2529
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,710
Okay,
what should we go to?

2530
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:08,720
what should we go to?
 

2531
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,549
what should we go to?
So,

2532
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:12,559

 

2533
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,309

this is where it came from. I just

2534
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:14,319
this is where it came from. I just
 

2535
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,309
this is where it came from. I just
copied from the above picture, but

2536
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:16,319
copied from the above picture, but
 

2537
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:17,990
copied from the above picture, but
there's no way we're going to get these

2538
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:18,000
there's no way we're going to get these
 

2539
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,589
there's no way we're going to get these
guys,

2540
00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:19,599
guys,
 

2541
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,950
guys,
right? So, I just copied it over with

2542
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
right? So, I just copied it over with
 

2543
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,510
right? So, I just copied it over with
like blank spots there.

2544
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:25,520
like blank spots there.
 

2545
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,950
like blank spots there.
So, what should we put in the blank

2546
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:26,960
So, what should we put in the blank
 

2547
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,109
So, what should we put in the blank
spots? Anyone want to venture a guess?

2548
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:31,119
spots? Anyone want to venture a guess?
 

2549
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:31,589
spots? Anyone want to venture a guess?
>> Yeah.

2550
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:31,599
>> Yeah.
 

2551
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,309
>> Yeah.
>> What if you just randomly choose values?

2552
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:34,319
>> What if you just randomly choose values?
 

2553
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,230
>> What if you just randomly choose values?
>> Randomly choosing values. Okay, that's

2554
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:36,240
>> Randomly choosing values. Okay, that's
 

2555
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,630
>> Randomly choosing values. Okay, that's
an interesting choice. Okay, so if you

2556
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:38,640
an interesting choice. Okay, so if you
 

2557
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,470
an interesting choice. Okay, so if you
don't know what goes there to choose

2558
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:40,480
don't know what goes there to choose
 

2559
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,470
don't know what goes there to choose
randomly uh is a choice. However, that

2560
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:44,480
randomly uh is a choice. However, that
 

2561
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,589
randomly uh is a choice. However, that
is introducing a bunch of noise into my

2562
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:47,599
is introducing a bunch of noise into my
 

2563
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,390
is introducing a bunch of noise into my
processing. So it tends not to be a good

2564
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
processing. So it tends not to be a good
 

2565
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,910
processing. So it tends not to be a good
choice.

2566
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:51,920
choice.
 

2567
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,990
choice.
Okay. So you don't know what goes there.

2568
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:54,000
Okay. So you don't know what goes there.
 

2569
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,710
Okay. So you don't know what goes there.
You do something. Yeah.

2570
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:56,720
You do something. Yeah.
 

2571
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:01,030
You do something. Yeah.

2573
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,470

>> Okay. So I'll write that as an idea.

2574
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:04,480

Ideas.

2577
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:19,910

>> Okay. What's another idea of what I

2578
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:19,920
>> Okay. What's another idea of what I
 

2579
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,630
>> Okay. What's another idea of what I

2580
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:24,640

 

2581
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,950

>> Okay. So the idea was so instead of

2582
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:26,960
>> Okay. So the idea was so instead of
 

2583
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,789
>> Okay. So the idea was so instead of
randomly generating it just for the

2584
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:28,799
randomly generating it just for the
 

2585
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,950
randomly generating it just for the
uniform distribution you could randomly

2586
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:30,960
uniform distribution you could randomly
 

2587
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:38,470
uniform distribution you could randomly
generate it using something else.

2588
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:38,480

 

2589
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,230

>> Okay.

2590
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:40,240
>> Okay.
 

2591
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,750
>> Okay.
So,

2592
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:41,760
So,
 

2593
00:59:41,760 --> 01:00:01,190
So,
I'll write that one down.

2594
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:01,200

 

2595
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,069

Okay. So it turns out although you can

2596
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:04,079
Okay. So it turns out although you can
 

2597
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:06,549
Okay. So it turns out although you can
do this, it tends not to be a good idea

2598
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:06,559
do this, it tends not to be a good idea
 

2599
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,190
do this, it tends not to be a good idea
for the same reason that what you're

2600
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,200
for the same reason that what you're
 

2601
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,349
for the same reason that what you're
doing here is

2602
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:11,359
doing here is
 

2603
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,150
doing here is
you actually know almost nothing about

2604
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,160
you actually know almost nothing about
 

2605
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,069
you actually know almost nothing about
what goes on here. And this value might

2606
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:18,079
what goes on here. And this value might
 

2607
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,470
what goes on here. And this value might
not uh be telling you all the

2608
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:20,480
not uh be telling you all the
 

2609
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,750
not uh be telling you all the
information you need of what goes on

2610
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
information you need of what goes on
 

2611
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,589
information you need of what goes on
here. So if you randomly sample from

2612
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:23,599
here. So if you randomly sample from
 

2613
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,030
here. So if you randomly sample from
some distribution, you're just injecting

2614
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,040
some distribution, you're just injecting
 

2615
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,910
some distribution, you're just injecting
noise, which again, sometimes that's a

2616
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:27,920
noise, which again, sometimes that's a
 

2617
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,430
noise, which again, sometimes that's a
useful thing to do, but it's not a

2618
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:29,440
useful thing to do, but it's not a
 

2619
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,750
useful thing to do, but it's not a
generically useful thing to do. Um

2620
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:31,760
generically useful thing to do. Um
 

2621
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,589
generically useful thing to do. Um
interpolation in a smooth way says that

2622
01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:35,599
interpolation in a smooth way says that
 

2623
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,829
interpolation in a smooth way says that
well you know something you don't know

2624
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:37,839
well you know something you don't know
 

2625
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,789
well you know something you don't know
what's here this three but you know

2626
01:00:40,789 --> 01:00:40,799
what's here this three but you know
 

2627
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:43,589
what's here this three but you know
there was a five over there so maybe

2628
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:43,599
there was a five over there so maybe
 

2629
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,470
there was a five over there so maybe
something in between makes sense so use

2630
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:46,480
something in between makes sense so use
 

2631
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,990
something in between makes sense so use
something about the neighboring thing.

2632
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:50,000
something about the neighboring thing.
 

2633
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,750
something about the neighboring thing.
Does anyone want to give a different uh

2634
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:51,760
Does anyone want to give a different uh
 

2635
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,069
Does anyone want to give a different uh
idea?

2636
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,079
idea?
 

2637
01:00:54,079 --> 01:01:03,430
idea?
>> Yeah. just like

2638
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:03,440

 

2639
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,750

ah so remember the question we're facing

2640
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:05,760
ah so remember the question we're facing
 

2641
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,750
ah so remember the question we're facing
just so make sure it's very clear all we

2642
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:07,760
just so make sure it's very clear all we
 

2643
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,670
just so make sure it's very clear all we
have is this

2644
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:09,680
have is this
 

2645
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:18,950
have is this
>> you

2646
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:18,960

 

2647
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,870

corner the top right corner Imagine

2648
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:24,880

 

2649
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,430

like rotating it. So,

2650
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:27,440
like rotating it. So,
 

2651
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,829
like rotating it. So,
>> so remember the idea here. So, this is a

2652
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:29,839
>> so remember the idea here. So, this is a
 

2653
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:32,470
>> so remember the idea here. So, this is a
proxy for an entire image.

2654
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:32,480
proxy for an entire image.
 

2655
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,390
proxy for an entire image.
Okay? So, you think about this is I I

2656
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:34,400
Okay? So, you think about this is I I
 

2657
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,230
Okay? So, you think about this is I I
drew four just because like it's small.

2658
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,240
drew four just because like it's small.
 

2659
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,069
drew four just because like it's small.
It's like an entire image. The entire

2660
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:38,079
It's like an entire image. The entire
 

2661
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,710
It's like an entire image. The entire
image started off 256 x 256 and now I

2662
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:40,720
image started off 256 x 256 and now I
 

2663
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,589
image started off 256 x 256 and now I
have 128 x 128. I want to get back to

2664
01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:43,599
have 128 x 128. I want to get back to
 

2665
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,510
have 128 x 128. I want to get back to
256 x 256. So

2666
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:47,520
256 x 256. So
 

2667
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,430
256 x 256. So
I know what goes I know that this was

2668
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:49,440
I know what goes I know that this was
 

2669
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,069
I know what goes I know that this was
generated by downsampling. So I knew I

2670
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:52,079
generated by downsampling. So I knew I
 

2671
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,109
generated by downsampling. So I knew I
know exactly what goes into these spots.

2672
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:55,119
know exactly what goes into these spots.
 

2673
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,630
know exactly what goes into these spots.
I the problem is I don't know what goes

2674
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,640
I the problem is I don't know what goes
 

2675
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,190
I the problem is I don't know what goes
into these spots. So a rotation based

2676
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,200
into these spots. So a rotation based
 

2677
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,069
into these spots. So a rotation based
idea that's tied to a 2x2 block doesn't

2678
01:02:02,069 --> 01:02:02,079
idea that's tied to a 2x2 block doesn't
 

2679
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,309
idea that's tied to a 2x2 block doesn't
generalize. Okay. So we have to think

2680
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:04,319
generalize. Okay. So we have to think
 

2681
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:05,910
generalize. Okay. So we have to think
about something that what's another

2682
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:05,920
about something that what's another
 

2683
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,230
about something that what's another
choice of what I can do. Yeah.

2684
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:08,240
choice of what I can do. Yeah.
 

2685
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,589
choice of what I can do. Yeah.
>> Initiate a function.

2686
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:11,599
>> Initiate a function.
 

2687
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,510
>> Initiate a function.
>> Um learn a function. Ah okay. Good. So

2688
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:13,520
>> Um learn a function. Ah okay. Good. So
 

2689
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,309
>> Um learn a function. Ah okay. Good. So
let's think about that way.

2690
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:16,319
let's think about that way.
 

2691
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,150
let's think about that way.
That's a good one. It's always a good

2692
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:18,160
That's a good one. It's always a good
 

2693
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,829
That's a good one. It's always a good
one, right? When you don't know what to

2694
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:19,839
one, right? When you don't know what to
 

2695
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:23,829
one, right? When you don't know what to
do, make it learnable. So,

2696
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:23,839
do, make it learnable. So,
 

2697
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:28,630
do, make it learnable. So,
make it learnable.

2698
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:28,640

 

2699
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,150

Okay.

2700
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:30,160
Okay.
 

2701
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,270
Okay.
So, if you want to make it learnable,

2702
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:33,280
So, if you want to make it learnable,
 

2703
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,030
So, if you want to make it learnable,
um we're going to go in that direction.

2704
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:35,040
um we're going to go in that direction.
 

2705
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:39,030
um we're going to go in that direction.
Uh so, one way to think about it is this

2706
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:39,040
Uh so, one way to think about it is this
 

2707
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:47,910
Uh so, one way to think about it is this
is a learnable version of a

2708
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:47,920

 

2709
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,390

I want to interpolate with neighboring

2710
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:50,400
I want to interpolate with neighboring
 

2711
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,190
I want to interpolate with neighboring
values in some way. I don't know how to

2712
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:53,200
values in some way. I don't know how to
 

2713
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,270
values in some way. I don't know how to
interpolate it. So I will make the

2714
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:55,280
interpolate it. So I will make the
 

2715
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,150
interpolate it. So I will make the
interpolation method learnable. Everyone

2716
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:58,160
interpolation method learnable. Everyone
 

2717
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,190
interpolation method learnable. Everyone
see that as a way to go. Okay, we're

2718
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:01,200
see that as a way to go. Okay, we're
 

2719
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,190
see that as a way to go. Okay, we're
going to follow that one. But there's

2720
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:03,200
going to follow that one. But there's
 

2721
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,510
going to follow that one. But there's
another one that I want to recognize as

2722
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:05,520
another one that I want to recognize as
 

2723
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,589
another one that I want to recognize as
a choice.

2724
01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:07,599
a choice.
 

2725
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,589
a choice.
So I'll just write it down for interest

2726
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:09,599
So I'll just write it down for interest
 

2727
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,470
So I'll just write it down for interest
of time. for max unpool I said look I

2728
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,480
of time. for max unpool I said look I
 

2729
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,069
of time. for max unpool I said look I
don't know what goes there so I can just

2730
01:03:14,069 --> 01:03:14,079
don't know what goes there so I can just
 

2731
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:16,549
don't know what goes there so I can just
fill it in with a default value and a

2732
01:03:16,549 --> 01:03:16,559
fill it in with a default value and a
 

2733
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,630
fill it in with a default value and a
default value of zero is a useful

2734
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:18,640
default value of zero is a useful
 

2735
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,950
default value of zero is a useful
default value zero is a useful default

2736
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:20,960
default value zero is a useful default
 

2737
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,829
default value zero is a useful default
when you're thinking about linear things

2738
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:23,839
when you're thinking about linear things
 

2739
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,510
when you're thinking about linear things
because zero behaves nicely with linear

2740
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:25,520
because zero behaves nicely with linear
 

2741
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,510
because zero behaves nicely with linear
things nonlinear things you have to be

2742
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:27,520
things nonlinear things you have to be
 

2743
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,950
things nonlinear things you have to be
careful about using zero as a default

2744
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:28,960
careful about using zero as a default
 

2745
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,630
careful about using zero as a default
value but for linear is definitely a

2746
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:30,640
value but for linear is definitely a
 

2747
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,789
value but for linear is definitely a
useful thing

2748
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:32,799
useful thing
 

2749
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:44,549
useful thing
so this is just fill with zeros

2750
01:03:44,549 --> 01:03:44,559

 

2751
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:49,430

Okay, so

2752
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:49,440

 

2753
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,109

it turns out that

2754
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:53,119
it turns out that
 

2755
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,710
it turns out that
there's a way of using things we already

2756
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:56,720
there's a way of using things we already
 

2757
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,870
there's a way of using things we already
know to achieve this make it learnable.

2758
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:00,880
know to achieve this make it learnable.
 

2759
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,390
know to achieve this make it learnable.
Okay. And the way you can make it um

2760
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:04,400
Okay. And the way you can make it um
 

2761
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,750
Okay. And the way you can make it um
learnable is to say the following. See

2762
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:07,760
learnable is to say the following. See
 

2763
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:15,349
learnable is to say the following. See
if I can write this idea.

2764
01:04:15,349 --> 01:04:15,359

 

2765
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,950

Use approach D

2766
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:18,960
Use approach D
 

2767
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,470
Use approach D
followed by

2768
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:24,480

 

2769
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,470

uh

2770
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:26,480
uh
 

2771
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,470
uh
learnable

2772
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:28,480
learnable
 

2773
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,029
learnable
con.

2774
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:33,039

 

2775
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:34,789

So the discussion will have you engage

2776
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:34,799
So the discussion will have you engage
 

2777
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:37,510
So the discussion will have you engage
with this. But

2778
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:37,520
with this. But
 

2779
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,990
with this. But
what is this saying? This says how can I

2780
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:40,000
what is this saying? This says how can I
 

2781
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,910
what is this saying? This says how can I
do interpolation?

2782
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:41,920
do interpolation?
 

2783
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,910
do interpolation?
One way of doing interpolation is to

2784
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:43,920
One way of doing interpolation is to
 

2785
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,470
One way of doing interpolation is to
view interpolation as a kind of blurring

2786
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:46,480
view interpolation as a kind of blurring
 

2787
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,470
view interpolation as a kind of blurring
operation. So this comes from a signal

2788
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:48,480
operation. So this comes from a signal
 

2789
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,710
operation. So this comes from a signal
processing perspective. So if anyone has

2790
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
processing perspective. So if anyone has
 

2791
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,829
processing perspective. So if anyone has
seen how you think about changing uh

2792
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:53,839
seen how you think about changing uh
 

2793
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:57,349
seen how you think about changing uh
sampling rates in signal processing, you

2794
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:57,359
sampling rates in signal processing, you
 

2795
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,510
sampling rates in signal processing, you
follow this idea of you take something,

2796
01:04:59,510 --> 01:04:59,520
follow this idea of you take something,
 

2797
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,910
follow this idea of you take something,
if you want to up sample it, you insert

2798
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:01,920
if you want to up sample it, you insert
 

2799
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,150
if you want to up sample it, you insert
zeros and then you smooth it.

2800
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:06,160
zeros and then you smooth it.
 

2801
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,390
zeros and then you smooth it.
So what that means is that you blur it.

2802
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:08,400
So what that means is that you blur it.
 

2803
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,789
So what that means is that you blur it.
A con is like a blur, a smoothing. So it

2804
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:10,799
A con is like a blur, a smoothing. So it
 

2805
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,270
A con is like a blur, a smoothing. So it
says I want to this has too much high

2806
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:13,280
says I want to this has too much high
 

2807
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,029
says I want to this has too much high
frequency stuff in it with zeros here.

2808
01:05:15,029 --> 01:05:15,039
frequency stuff in it with zeros here.
 

2809
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,549
frequency stuff in it with zeros here.
So I put zeros in here. Just write

2810
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:16,559
So I put zeros in here. Just write
 

2811
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:27,430
So I put zeros in here. Just write
zeros.

2812
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:27,440

 

2813
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,230

So if I smooth this with some kind of

2814
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:30,240
So if I smooth this with some kind of
 

2815
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,109
So if I smooth this with some kind of
blur blurring filter then I'll get

2816
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:33,119
blur blurring filter then I'll get
 

2817
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,589
blur blurring filter then I'll get
something that's smooth everywhere. Does

2818
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:35,599
something that's smooth everywhere. Does
 

2819
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,470
something that's smooth everywhere. Does
everyone see that as the intuition?

2820
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:38,480
everyone see that as the intuition?
 

2821
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,029
everyone see that as the intuition?
Okay. So

2822
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:41,039
Okay. So
 

2823
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:42,789
Okay. So
so if I if I do D followed by a

2824
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:42,799
so if I if I do D followed by a
 

2825
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:46,230
so if I if I do D followed by a
learnable con this whole thing

2826
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:46,240
learnable con this whole thing
 

2827
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,069
learnable con this whole thing
behaves

2828
01:05:50,069 --> 01:05:50,079

 

2829
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,589

like

2830
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:53,599

 

2831
01:05:53,599 --> 01:06:00,150

learnable interpolation.

2832
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:00,160

 

2833
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,309

Okay, does everyone understand this?

2834
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:04,319
Okay, does everyone understand this?
 

2835
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:06,470
Okay, does everyone understand this?
This is the part that often even in the

2836
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:06,480
This is the part that often even in the
 

2837
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,470
This is the part that often even in the
I think the description in Prince's book

2838
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:08,480
I think the description in Prince's book
 

2839
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,270
I think the description in Prince's book
doesn't make this as clear. This is

2840
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:11,280
doesn't make this as clear. This is
 

2841
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,190
doesn't make this as clear. This is
intuitive. Nothing new is happening

2842
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:13,200
intuitive. Nothing new is happening
 

2843
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,870
intuitive. Nothing new is happening
here, right? It's just I would like to

2844
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:16,880
here, right? It's just I would like to
 

2845
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,029
here, right? It's just I would like to
do something I can fill with zeros and I

2846
01:06:19,029 --> 01:06:19,039
do something I can fill with zeros and I
 

2847
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,589
do something I can fill with zeros and I
can do a con. Okay. So now comes the

2848
01:06:23,589 --> 01:06:23,599
can do a con. Okay. So now comes the
 

2849
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,230
can do a con. Okay. So now comes the
idea of what's called a transpose

2850
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:26,240
idea of what's called a transpose
 

2851
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,870
idea of what's called a transpose
convolution.

2852
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:28,880
convolution.
 

2853
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,510
convolution.
So what is a transpose convolution?

2854
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:31,520
So what is a transpose convolution?
 

2855
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,510
So what is a transpose convolution?
Okay, it's a

2856
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:35,520

 

2857
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,589

think of it this way. In downsampling,

2858
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
think of it this way. In downsampling,
 

2859
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,950
think of it this way. In downsampling,
we had the idea that if I have a con

2860
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:42,960
we had the idea that if I have a con
 

2861
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,390
we had the idea that if I have a con
followed by subsampling,

2862
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:46,400
followed by subsampling,
 

2863
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,549
followed by subsampling,
I can avoid redundant computation

2864
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:50,559
I can avoid redundant computation
 

2865
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:53,829
I can avoid redundant computation
by just computing only the things I

2866
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:53,839
by just computing only the things I
 

2867
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:57,990
by just computing only the things I
need. And that was called a strided con.

2868
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
need. And that was called a strided con.
 

2869
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,029
need. And that was called a strided con.
Everyone remember this?

2870
01:07:01,029 --> 01:07:01,039
Everyone remember this?
 

2871
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:05,510
Everyone remember this?
So now the question is in upsampling I

2872
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:05,520
So now the question is in upsampling I
 

2873
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,990
So now the question is in upsampling I
have this zero fill

2874
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,000
have this zero fill
 

2875
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,710
have this zero fill
upsampling this kind of thing followed

2876
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:10,720
upsampling this kind of thing followed
 

2877
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,510
upsampling this kind of thing followed
by a con

2878
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:13,520
by a con
 

2879
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,349
by a con
can I merge those two operations

2880
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:15,359
can I merge those two operations
 

2881
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:20,069
can I merge those two operations
together into a strided something

2882
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:20,079
together into a strided something
 

2883
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,230
together into a strided something
does everyone see this as the kind of

2884
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:22,240
does everyone see this as the kind of
 

2885
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:27,510
does everyone see this as the kind of
it's just by by analogy by parallel

2886
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520

 

2887
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,390

so this thing is called a transpose con

2888
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:30,400
so this thing is called a transpose con
 

2889
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,150
so this thing is called a transpose con
and why it's cause called a transposed

2890
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:32,160
and why it's cause called a transposed
 

2891
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,549
and why it's cause called a transposed
con is a nice figure in printince that

2892
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:34,559
con is a nice figure in printince that
 

2893
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,750
con is a nice figure in printince that
shows you. So

2894
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:37,760
shows you. So
 

2895
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,670
shows you. So
over here you see a strided con.

2896
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:41,680
over here you see a strided con.
 

2897
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,190
over here you see a strided con.
It's taking x1 through x8 and

2898
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:45,200
It's taking x1 through x8 and
 

2899
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,589
It's taking x1 through x8 and
downsampling it by a factor of two with

2900
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:47,599
downsampling it by a factor of two with
 

2901
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,670
downsampling it by a factor of two with
a conve.

2902
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:49,680
a conve.
 

2903
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,349
a conve.
So, you know, this light edge is the

2904
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:53,359
So, you know, this light edge is the
 

2905
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:58,230
So, you know, this light edge is the
same edge that goes across.

2906
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:58,240

 

2907
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,670

The darker edge is the edge going to the

2908
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:01,680
The darker edge is the edge going to the
 

2909
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:05,589
The darker edge is the edge going to the
next thing. And the

2910
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:05,599
next thing. And the
 

2911
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,990
next thing. And the
lighter but not as light edge is going

2912
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:08,000
lighter but not as light edge is going
 

2913
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,510
lighter but not as light edge is going
up.

2914
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:09,520
up.
 

2915
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,270
up.
Okay?

2916
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:11,280
Okay?
 

2917
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,789
Okay?
And this is a strided con. Does everyone

2918
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:14,799
And this is a strided con. Does everyone
 

2919
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,630
And this is a strided con. Does everyone
see that?

2920
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:16,640
see that?
 

2921
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,870
see that?
Okay. strided con when you write it out

2922
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:18,880
Okay. strided con when you write it out
 

2923
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,870
Okay. strided con when you write it out
as a matrix

2924
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:20,880
as a matrix
 

2925
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,749
as a matrix
where the output is h and the input is

2926
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:23,759
where the output is h and the input is
 

2927
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:30,470
where the output is h and the input is
the x you get this diagonal structure

2928
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:30,480

 

2929
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,269

with weight which shared where here's

2930
01:08:33,269 --> 01:08:33,279
with weight which shared where here's
 

2931
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,749
with weight which shared where here's
the con

2932
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:35,759
the con
 

2933
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,229
the con
everyone see it

2934
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:38,239
everyone see it
 

2935
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,550
everyone see it
okay now

2936
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,560
okay now
 

2937
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,829
okay now
let's do the opposite effect

2938
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:43,839
let's do the opposite effect
 

2939
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:48,309
let's do the opposite effect
where I go from low to I

2940
01:08:48,309 --> 01:08:48,319
where I go from low to I
 

2941
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,870
where I go from low to I
I'm still doing a comp

2942
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:50,880
I'm still doing a comp
 

2943
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,910
I'm still doing a comp
still the same kind of con is happening.

2944
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:55,920

 

2945
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,630

Okay.

2946
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:58,640
Okay.
 

2947
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,870
Okay.
So what's happening is just to

2948
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:00,880
So what's happening is just to
 

2949
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,390
So what's happening is just to
understand this picture precisely

2950
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,400
understand this picture precisely
 

2951
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,349
understand this picture precisely
let me just uh put in some more things.

2952
01:09:07,349 --> 01:09:07,359
let me just uh put in some more things.
 

2953
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:14,709
let me just uh put in some more things.
There's a hidden zero here,

2954
01:09:14,709 --> 01:09:14,719

 

2955
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,149

but 0 multiplied by anything is zero. So

2956
01:09:18,149 --> 01:09:18,159
but 0 multiplied by anything is zero. So
 

2957
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:19,749
but 0 multiplied by anything is zero. So
you don't have to worry about its edges,

2958
01:09:19,749 --> 01:09:19,759
you don't have to worry about its edges,
 

2959
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:23,110
you don't have to worry about its edges,
outgoing edges. Does everyone see that?

2960
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:23,120
outgoing edges. Does everyone see that?
 

2961
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,590
outgoing edges. Does everyone see that?
They're there, but there's no point in

2962
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:25,600
They're there, but there's no point in
 

2963
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,669
They're there, but there's no point in
doing that multiplication. We can save

2964
01:09:27,669 --> 01:09:27,679
doing that multiplication. We can save
 

2965
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,749
doing that multiplication. We can save
that work.

2966
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:31,759

 

2967
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:34,709

And then you get this matrix.

2968
01:09:34,709 --> 01:09:34,719
And then you get this matrix.
 

2969
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,870
And then you get this matrix.
And now hopefully the name transposecon

2970
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:36,880
And now hopefully the name transposecon
 

2971
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,709
And now hopefully the name transposecon
is clear

2972
01:09:38,709 --> 01:09:38,719
is clear
 

2973
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:41,910
is clear
right this matrix and this matrix you

2974
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:41,920
right this matrix and this matrix you
 

2975
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,870
right this matrix and this matrix you
know their shape is just like transposes

2976
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:44,880
know their shape is just like transposes
 

2977
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,829
know their shape is just like transposes
of each other

2978
01:09:47,829 --> 01:09:47,839
of each other
 

2979
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:50,709
of each other
that's why it's called transpose con

2980
01:09:50,709 --> 01:09:50,719
that's why it's called transpose con
 

2981
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,950
that's why it's called transpose con
okay so questions on this picture then

2982
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:52,960
okay so questions on this picture then
 

2983
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,149
okay so questions on this picture then
I'll I'll talk about it a little bit

2984
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:54,159
I'll I'll talk about it a little bit
 

2985
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:55,110
I'll I'll talk about it a little bit
more yeah

2986
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:55,120
more yeah
 

2987
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,350
more yeah
>> sorry is that hidden zero I know you

2988
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:57,360
>> sorry is that hidden zero I know you
 

2989
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,390
>> sorry is that hidden zero I know you
said that it's just zero so it

2990
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:00,400
said that it's just zero so it
 

2991
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,870
said that it's just zero so it
But like does it have like a connection

2992
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:02,880
But like does it have like a connection
 

2993
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,550
But like does it have like a connection
to H1 and H2?

2994
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:04,560
to H1 and H2?
 

2995
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,630
to H1 and H2?
>> Yes, you could you should think of it as

2996
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:06,640
>> Yes, you could you should think of it as
 

2997
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,390
>> Yes, you could you should think of it as
having

2998
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:08,400
having
 

2999
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,189
having
um now I can't do this but I would love

3000
01:10:11,189 --> 01:10:11,199
um now I can't do this but I would love
 

3001
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,030
um now I can't do this but I would love
to do Okay, I'll just show you what I

3002
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,040
to do Okay, I'll just show you what I
 

3003
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,510
to do Okay, I'll just show you what I
want to do but it doesn't work. Okay, I

3004
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,520
want to do but it doesn't work. Okay, I
 

3005
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,510
want to do but it doesn't work. Okay, I
would take these

3006
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:17,520
would take these
 

3007
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,870
would take these
and I would copy them

3008
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:20,880
and I would copy them
 

3009
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,790
and I would copy them
up here

3010
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:22,800
up here
 

3011
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,669
up here
but it doesn't work. Okay, because I

3012
01:10:25,669 --> 01:10:25,679
but it doesn't work. Okay, because I
 

3013
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,750
but it doesn't work. Okay, because I
can't copy like that for some reason.

3014
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:27,760
can't copy like that for some reason.
 

3015
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,510
can't copy like that for some reason.
Okay, but those edges are there. So if I

3016
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:31,520
Okay, but those edges are there. So if I
 

3017
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,910
Okay, but those edges are there. So if I
think about the idea of doing this step

3018
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:33,920
think about the idea of doing this step
 

3019
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,870
think about the idea of doing this step
here

3020
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:36,880
here
 

3021
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,590
here
followed by a learnable con,

3022
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:39,600
followed by a learnable con,
 

3023
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:45,350
followed by a learnable con,
right? These zeros are these zeros.

3024
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:45,360

 

3025
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,590

So you see that if I do a con with

3026
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:47,600
So you see that if I do a con with
 

3027
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,830
So you see that if I do a con with
zeros,

3028
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:49,840
zeros,
 

3029
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,669
zeros,
there's operations I'm doing whose

3030
01:10:51,669 --> 01:10:51,679
there's operations I'm doing whose
 

3031
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:53,910
there's operations I'm doing whose
answer I know is going to be zero. So

3032
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:53,920
answer I know is going to be zero. So
 

3033
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,910
answer I know is going to be zero. So
let me just save those multiplies.

3034
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:55,920
let me just save those multiplies.
 

3035
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,270
let me just save those multiplies.
That's all that's this is a

3036
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:57,280
That's all that's this is a
 

3037
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,830
That's all that's this is a
computational savings. It's not a

3038
01:10:59,830 --> 01:10:59,840
computational savings. It's not a
 

3039
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,510
computational savings. It's not a
conceptual step. There's nothing

3040
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:01,520
conceptual step. There's nothing
 

3041
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,669
conceptual step. There's nothing
conceptual here.

3042
01:11:03,669 --> 01:11:03,679
conceptual here.
 

3043
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,870
conceptual here.
Transpose cons and strided cons exist

3044
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:06,880
Transpose cons and strided cons exist
 

3045
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,550
Transpose cons and strided cons exist
only for computational savings.

3046
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:10,560
only for computational savings.
 

3047
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,030
only for computational savings.
This is the part that students sometimes

3048
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:13,040
This is the part that students sometimes
 

3049
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,110
This is the part that students sometimes
get confused by seems like lots of

3050
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,120
get confused by seems like lots of
 

3051
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,590
get confused by seems like lots of
details but if you keep the big picture

3052
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:17,600
details but if you keep the big picture
 

3053
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,669
details but if you keep the big picture
straight it's it's easier to understand.

3054
01:11:19,669 --> 01:11:19,679
straight it's it's easier to understand.
 

3055
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,750
straight it's it's easier to understand.
Yeah. I'm just wondering like what is

3056
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:21,760
Yeah. I'm just wondering like what is
 

3057
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,630
Yeah. I'm just wondering like what is
the obstacification

3058
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:26,640

 

3059
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,709

or are we moving to the

3060
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:28,719
or are we moving to the
 

3061
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:31,030
or are we moving to the
>> Yeah. So I mean uh I'm going to talk

3062
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:31,040
>> Yeah. So I mean uh I'm going to talk
 

3063
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,070
>> Yeah. So I mean uh I'm going to talk
about like semantic segmentation. So I

3064
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:34,080
about like semantic segmentation. So I
 

3065
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,350
about like semantic segmentation. So I
want to label everything in the image.

3066
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:35,360
want to label everything in the image.
 

3067
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,270
want to label everything in the image.
So how do I do this? I need to be able

3068
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:37,280
So how do I do this? I need to be able
 

3069
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,790
So how do I do this? I need to be able
to go back up to a higher resolution.

3070
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:38,800
to go back up to a higher resolution.
 

3071
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,310
to go back up to a higher resolution.
That's just the picture. But I want to

3072
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:40,320
That's just the picture. But I want to
 

3073
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,790
That's just the picture. But I want to
just talk about this operation first to

3074
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:42,800
just talk about this operation first to
 

3075
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,630
just talk about this operation first to
make sure the operation is clear.

3076
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:46,640
make sure the operation is clear.
 

3077
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,669
make sure the operation is clear.
Okay.

3078
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:49,679

 

3079
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,550

So if you remember the

3080
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
So if you remember the
 

3081
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,270
So if you remember the
um 3x3 perspective we had before

3082
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:57,280
um 3x3 perspective we had before
 

3083
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,790
um 3x3 perspective we had before
some people find this helpful some

3084
01:11:58,790 --> 01:11:58,800
some people find this helpful some
 

3085
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,870
some people find this helpful some
people don't.

3086
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:00,880
people don't.
 

3087
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,550
people don't.
We said that look what's happening in a

3088
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:04,560
We said that look what's happening in a
 

3089
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,470
We said that look what's happening in a
in a con is that you have neighbors. So

3090
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:08,480
in a con is that you have neighbors. So
 

3091
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,310
in a con is that you have neighbors. So
this is different colored edges. You

3092
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:10,320
this is different colored edges. You
 

3093
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,630
this is different colored edges. You
have the mi edge that's like from the

3094
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:12,640
have the mi edge that's like from the
 

3095
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,550
have the mi edge that's like from the
same position to the same position. Then

3096
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:14,560
same position to the same position. Then
 

3097
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,630
same position to the same position. Then
you have the north and northeast and so

3098
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:16,640
you have the north and northeast and so
 

3099
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,510
you have the north and northeast and so
on. Different edges. And what you're

3100
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:19,520
on. Different edges. And what you're
 

3101
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,669
on. Different edges. And what you're
doing at the output is just taking all

3102
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:21,679
doing at the output is just taking all
 

3103
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,470
doing at the output is just taking all
the channel information

3104
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:24,480
the channel information
 

3105
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,270
the channel information
in different positions, multiplying them

3106
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:27,280
in different positions, multiplying them
 

3107
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,110
in different positions, multiplying them
by the appropriate weight learned weight

3108
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:29,120
by the appropriate weight learned weight
 

3109
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,430
by the appropriate weight learned weight
matrices, adding them up, and adding the

3110
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:31,440
matrices, adding them up, and adding the
 

3111
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,790
matrices, adding them up, and adding the
bias. That's a con. Now, I just finished

3112
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:34,800
bias. That's a con. Now, I just finished
 

3113
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,189
bias. That's a con. Now, I just finished
telling you that there's only regular

3114
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199
telling you that there's only regular
 

3115
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,149
telling you that there's only regular
cons. That's it.

3116
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:40,159
cons. That's it.
 

3117
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:42,070
cons. That's it.
Conceptually, there's nothing different.

3118
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:42,080
Conceptually, there's nothing different.
 

3119
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,030
Conceptually, there's nothing different.
There's only regular cons. strided cons

3120
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:45,040
There's only regular cons. strided cons
 

3121
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:49,270
There's only regular cons. strided cons
transpose cons are just different

3122
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:49,280
transpose cons are just different
 

3123
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,350
transpose cons are just different
savings of computation by avoiding

3124
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:51,360
savings of computation by avoiding
 

3125
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,990
savings of computation by avoiding
multiplications by zero.

3126
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:54,000
multiplications by zero.
 

3127
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,830
multiplications by zero.
That's all you're doing. Okay. So in

3128
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:57,840
That's all you're doing. Okay. So in
 

3129
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,950
That's all you're doing. Okay. So in
this picture in a standard con you can

3130
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:00,960
this picture in a standard con you can
 

3131
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,669
this picture in a standard con you can
think about this sum always ranges over

3132
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:05,679
think about this sum always ranges over
 

3133
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,430
think about this sum always ranges over
the k by k positions in the con filter.

3134
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:09,440
the k by k positions in the con filter.
 

3135
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,189
the k by k positions in the con filter.
So for every output position, you're

3136
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:11,199
So for every output position, you're
 

3137
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,750
So for every output position, you're
going to look at all of the

3138
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:13,760
going to look at all of the
 

3139
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,310
going to look at all of the
uh neighboring positions.

3140
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:16,320
uh neighboring positions.
 

3141
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,590
uh neighboring positions.
The only difference is when you're doing

3142
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:17,600
The only difference is when you're doing
 

3143
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,430
The only difference is when you're doing
zero padding and you're at the edge, but

3144
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:19,440
zero padding and you're at the edge, but
 

3145
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,669
zero padding and you're at the edge, but
the edge in an image is small, right?

3146
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:23,679
the edge in an image is small, right?
 

3147
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,510
the edge in an image is small, right?
The edge, remember the edge grows. The

3148
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:25,520
The edge, remember the edge grows. The
 

3149
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,189
The edge, remember the edge grows. The
size of the edge is like the

3150
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,199
size of the edge is like the
 

3151
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,950
size of the edge is like the
circumference and the size of the image

3152
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:28,960
circumference and the size of the image
 

3153
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,709
circumference and the size of the image
is like the area. Circumference grows

3154
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:30,719
is like the area. Circumference grows
 

3155
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,709
is like the area. Circumference grows
linearly with the image. Area grows

3156
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:32,719
linearly with the image. Area grows
 

3157
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:34,470
linearly with the image. Area grows
quadratically. So most of the image is

3158
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:34,480
quadratically. So most of the image is
 

3159
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,310
quadratically. So most of the image is
inside.

3160
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:36,320
inside.
 

3161
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,910
inside.
So we don't we don't worry about saving

3162
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:37,920
So we don't we don't worry about saving
 

3163
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,189
So we don't we don't worry about saving
that. con on the zeros.

3164
01:13:41,189 --> 01:13:41,199
that. con on the zeros.
 

3165
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:45,030
that. con on the zeros.
Not much not much to say there.

3166
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,040
Not much not much to say there.
 

3167
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,950
Not much not much to say there.
Um,

3168
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:46,960
Um,
 

3169
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,830
Um,
now in a transpose con, the issue is

3170
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:49,840
now in a transpose con, the issue is
 

3171
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,750
now in a transpose con, the issue is
that lots of the neighboring positions

3172
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:51,760
that lots of the neighboring positions
 

3173
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,070
that lots of the neighboring positions
are actually zeros.

3174
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:54,080
are actually zeros.
 

3175
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,709
are actually zeros.
The zeros are dense. They're every

3176
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:56,719
The zeros are dense. They're every
 

3177
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,709
The zeros are dense. They're every
filling your entire image is filled with

3178
01:13:58,709 --> 01:13:58,719
filling your entire image is filled with
 

3179
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:01,990
filling your entire image is filled with
zeros. So, it's a lot of savings to not

3180
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,000
zeros. So, it's a lot of savings to not
 

3181
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,470
zeros. So, it's a lot of savings to not
do those multiplications.

3182
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:04,480
do those multiplications.
 

3183
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,229
do those multiplications.
Everyone see that? So you can think

3184
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:06,239
Everyone see that? So you can think
 

3185
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:09,590
Everyone see that? So you can think
about in this expression as this sum

3186
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:09,600
about in this expression as this sum
 

3187
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,070
about in this expression as this sum
only ranges over the relevant things the

3188
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,080
only ranges over the relevant things the
 

3189
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,310
only ranges over the relevant things the
ones that are not zero and that's

3190
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:14,320
ones that are not zero and that's
 

3191
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,790
ones that are not zero and that's
different for different positions in the

3192
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:16,800
different for different positions in the
 

3193
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,870
different for different positions in the
output.

3194
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,880
output.
 

3195
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,709
output.
Okay.

3196
01:14:20,709 --> 01:14:20,719
Okay.
 

3197
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,790
Okay.
So um like here

3198
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:24,800
So um like here
 

3199
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,149
So um like here
you see the difference of different

3200
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:26,159
you see the difference of different
 

3201
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,149
you see the difference of different
positions here in this picture on one

3202
01:14:28,149 --> 01:14:28,159
positions here in this picture on one
 

3203
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:31,430
positions here in this picture on one
dimensional picture. This one sees this

3204
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
dimensional picture. This one sees this
 

3205
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,470
dimensional picture. This one sees this
guy. This one sees this guy and this

3206
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:34,480
guy. This one sees this guy and this
 

3207
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,110
guy. This one sees this guy and this
guy. This one just sees this guy and so

3208
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:37,120
guy. This one just sees this guy and so
 

3209
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,030
guy. This one just sees this guy and so
on. Different positions see different

3210
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,040
on. Different positions see different
 

3211
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,070
on. Different positions see different
neighbors.

3212
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,080

 

3213
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,110

Okay, this hopefully helps uh some

3214
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,120
Okay, this hopefully helps uh some
 

3215
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,910
Okay, this hopefully helps uh some
people understand what's happening. Um

3216
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:49,920
people understand what's happening. Um
 

3217
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,910
people understand what's happening. Um
third approach to understand what's

3218
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:51,920
third approach to understand what's
 

3219
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,790
third approach to understand what's
happening is look at code. Okay, so this

3220
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:54,800
happening is look at code. Okay, so this
 

3221
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,550
happening is look at code. Okay, so this
is from uh D2L.ai. It's another

3222
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:58,560
is from uh D2L.ai. It's another
 

3223
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,669
is from uh D2L.ai. It's another
textbook. Um, it was nice because it had

3224
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:01,679
textbook. Um, it was nice because it had
 

3225
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:03,270
textbook. Um, it was nice because it had
like parallel sets of code that are

3226
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,280
like parallel sets of code that are
 

3227
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,229
like parallel sets of code that are
describing the same uh standard cons and

3228
01:15:06,229 --> 01:15:06,239
describing the same uh standard cons and
 

3229
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:09,110
describing the same uh standard cons and
uh transpose cons.

3230
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:09,120
uh transpose cons.
 

3231
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,270
uh transpose cons.
And I've just marked for you what's uh

3232
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:13,280
And I've just marked for you what's uh
 

3233
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,110
And I've just marked for you what's uh
sort of different across the two things.

3234
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,120
sort of different across the two things.
 

3235
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,189
sort of different across the two things.
So this is a simplified case where we're

3236
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:17,199
So this is a simplified case where we're
 

3237
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:18,709
So this is a simplified case where we're
not talking about lots of channels, just

3238
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:18,719
not talking about lots of channels, just
 

3239
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,070
not talking about lots of channels, just
one channel in this in this picture.

3240
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,080
one channel in this in this picture.
 

3241
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,510
one channel in this in this picture.
uh and you start with an X. You have a

3242
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:25,520
uh and you start with an X. You have a
 

3243
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,750
uh and you start with an X. You have a
filter K you want to apply and what do

3244
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:29,760
filter K you want to apply and what do
 

3245
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,270
filter K you want to apply and what do
you do? Okay, so it has to fit in the

3246
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
you do? Okay, so it has to fit in the
 

3247
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,270
you do? Okay, so it has to fit in the
image. And this is where the fitting in

3248
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:35,280
image. And this is where the fitting in
 

3249
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,790
image. And this is where the fitting in
the image is different on the transpose

3250
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:36,800
the image is different on the transpose
 

3251
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,229
the image is different on the transpose
side than on the regular side. To fit

3252
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:40,239
side than on the regular side. To fit
 

3253
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,550
side than on the regular side. To fit
inside the image, you have to make the

3254
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
inside the image, you have to make the
 

3255
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,070
inside the image, you have to make the
image smaller,

3256
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:46,080

 

3257
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,270

right? By the height and width of the

3258
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:47,280
right? By the height and width of the
 

3259
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,590
right? By the height and width of the
filter. So everything fits.

3260
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:49,600
filter. So everything fits.
 

3261
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,590
filter. So everything fits.
But in the transpose you make it bigger

3262
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:53,600
But in the transpose you make it bigger
 

3263
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,470
But in the transpose you make it bigger
because everything will spill out

3264
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:56,480
because everything will spill out
 

3265
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,390
because everything will spill out
right to the outside because the

3266
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,400
right to the outside because the
 

3267
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,990
right to the outside because the
remember the outside in this picture the

3268
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,000
remember the outside in this picture the
 

3269
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,189
remember the outside in this picture the
outside of the image is thought of as

3270
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:01,199
outside of the image is thought of as
 

3271
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,669
outside of the image is thought of as
filled with zeros

3272
01:16:03,669 --> 01:16:03,679
filled with zeros
 

3273
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,590
filled with zeros
uh for the transpose con. So that's this

3274
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:05,600
uh for the transpose con. So that's this
 

3275
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,870
uh for the transpose con. So that's this
plus h is here plus w.

3276
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:10,880

 

3277
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,830

Then you can think about the same exact

3278
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:13,840
Then you can think about the same exact
 

3279
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,510
Then you can think about the same exact
operation as two different ways of

3280
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:15,520
operation as two different ways of
 

3281
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,830
operation as two different ways of
looking at the sums.

3282
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:17,840
looking at the sums.
 

3283
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,870
looking at the sums.
One way is you range in the standard

3284
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:20,880
One way is you range in the standard
 

3285
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,590
One way is you range in the standard
conf you range over the output shape

3286
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:25,600
conf you range over the output shape
 

3287
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,350
conf you range over the output shape
and as you range over the output shape

3288
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,360
and as you range over the output shape
 

3289
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:33,990
and as you range over the output shape
you fill in that position with this sum

3290
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:34,000

 

3291
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,189

where you take the appropriate slice of

3292
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:37,199
where you take the appropriate slice of
 

3293
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:41,590
where you take the appropriate slice of
x around i and j the corresponding

3294
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:41,600
x around i and j the corresponding
 

3295
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,950
x around i and j the corresponding
position and you take the sum

3296
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:44,960
position and you take the sum
 

3297
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,149
position and you take the sum
and the transpose con perspective. on

3298
01:16:48,149 --> 01:16:48,159
and the transpose con perspective. on
 

3299
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:51,030
and the transpose con perspective. on
the same basic operation is you range

3300
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:51,040
the same basic operation is you range
 

3301
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,590
the same basic operation is you range
over all the x positions

3302
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:53,600
over all the x positions
 

3303
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,550
over all the x positions
and you send those x positions

3304
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:56,560
and you send those x positions
 

3305
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,110
and you send those x positions
according to the filter out into y. Same

3306
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:01,120
according to the filter out into y. Same
 

3307
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,270
according to the filter out into y. Same
thing just two different ways of looking

3308
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:03,280
thing just two different ways of looking
 

3309
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:07,510
thing just two different ways of looking
at it.

3310
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:07,520

 

3311
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,550

This perspective plays nicely with

3312
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:10,560
This perspective plays nicely with
 

3313
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,390
This perspective plays nicely with
strides that down sample.

3314
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:14,400
strides that down sample.
 

3315
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,229
strides that down sample.
This perspective plays nicely with

3316
01:17:16,229 --> 01:17:16,239
This perspective plays nicely with
 

3317
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:18,630
This perspective plays nicely with
strides that upsample

3318
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:18,640
strides that upsample
 

3319
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,350
strides that upsample
and that's why you use one of the two

3320
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,360
and that's why you use one of the two
 

3321
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,430
and that's why you use one of the two
perspectives for the two cases to save

3322
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:23,440
perspectives for the two cases to save
 

3323
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,510
perspectives for the two cases to save
computation. Remember it's only to save

3324
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:25,520
computation. Remember it's only to save
 

3325
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,590
computation. Remember it's only to save
computation. There is nothing conceptual

3326
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:27,600
computation. There is nothing conceptual
 

3327
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:33,110
computation. There is nothing conceptual
in a transpose conf or a strided conf.

3328
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:33,120

 

3329
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:40,550

Any questions on this?

3330
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:40,560

 

3331
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,830

Okay. So now I want to put things

3332
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:43,840
Okay. So now I want to put things
 

3333
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,390
Okay. So now I want to put things
together and say now we have all the

3334
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:46,400
together and say now we have all the
 

3335
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,910
together and say now we have all the
building blocks we almost all the

3336
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:47,920
building blocks we almost all the
 

3337
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,990
building blocks we almost all the
building blocks we need. How do you do

3338
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:50,000
building blocks we need. How do you do
 

3339
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,870
building blocks we need. How do you do
image level tasks? By image level tasks

3340
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:52,880
image level tasks? By image level tasks
 

3341
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,030
image level tasks? By image level tasks
I mean a task in which the output is an

3342
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:55,040
I mean a task in which the output is an
 

3343
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,990
I mean a task in which the output is an
image. Machine learning thing will take

3344
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,000
image. Machine learning thing will take
 

3345
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,390
image. Machine learning thing will take
an image as an input and have an output

3346
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:00,400
an image as an input and have an output
 

3347
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,750
an image as an input and have an output
be an image.

3348
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:03,760
be an image.
 

3349
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,510
be an image.
The semantic segmentation is like the

3350
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:05,520
The semantic segmentation is like the
 

3351
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,950
The semantic segmentation is like the
easiest one where the image is the same

3352
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:06,960
easiest one where the image is the same
 

3353
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,270
easiest one where the image is the same
size as the beginning. Every pixel has

3354
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:09,280
size as the beginning. Every pixel has
 

3355
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,030
size as the beginning. Every pixel has
to be labeled.

3356
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:11,040
to be labeled.
 

3357
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,229
to be labeled.
So here's a figure um in prints for an

3358
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:14,239
So here's a figure um in prints for an
 

3359
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:17,669
So here's a figure um in prints for an
approach that people uh followed. So in

3360
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
approach that people uh followed. So in
 

3361
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:20,630
approach that people uh followed. So in
this approach what you do is you say

3362
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:20,640
this approach what you do is you say
 

3363
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,229
this approach what you do is you say
look I'm going to take the entire image

3364
01:18:24,229 --> 01:18:24,239
look I'm going to take the entire image
 

3365
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,070
look I'm going to take the entire image
that I have and I'm going to build

3366
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:26,080
that I have and I'm going to build
 

3367
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,430
that I have and I'm going to build
something like a classifier pipeline.

3368
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:29,440
something like a classifier pipeline.
 

3369
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,830
something like a classifier pipeline.
Okay. So, I'm going to keep making it

3370
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:31,840
Okay. So, I'm going to keep making it
 

3371
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,910
Okay. So, I'm going to keep making it
smaller and smaller, and I'm trying to

3372
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:35,920
smaller and smaller, and I'm trying to
 

3373
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,310
smaller and smaller, and I'm trying to
figure out what is going on in this

3374
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:38,320
figure out what is going on in this
 

3375
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,830
figure out what is going on in this
image.

3376
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:39,840
image.
 

3377
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,270
image.
And in this spot in the middle, I've

3378
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:43,280
And in this spot in the middle, I've
 

3379
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,110
And in this spot in the middle, I've
basically distilled the entire image

3380
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:45,120
basically distilled the entire image
 

3381
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:49,350
basically distilled the entire image
down into these 4,96 numbers that are

3382
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:49,360
down into these 4,96 numbers that are
 

3383
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:53,350
down into these 4,96 numbers that are
representing what's happening. Then I do

3384
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:53,360
representing what's happening. Then I do
 

3385
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,990
representing what's happening. Then I do
the reverse.

3386
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:56,000
the reverse.
 

3387
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,750
the reverse.
I make it bigger and bigger and bigger.

3388
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:57,760
I make it bigger and bigger and bigger.
 

3389
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,310
I make it bigger and bigger and bigger.
So first I take these 4,96 numbers and I

3390
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:00,320
So first I take these 4,96 numbers and I
 

3391
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:05,270
So first I take these 4,96 numbers and I
make a little 7 by7 image and then

3392
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:05,280
make a little 7 by7 image and then
 

3393
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,990
make a little 7 by7 image and then
I remember I do I basically follow the

3394
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:08,000
I remember I do I basically follow the
 

3395
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,750
I remember I do I basically follow the
things going backwards. I do a max

3396
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:09,760
things going backwards. I do a max
 

3397
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,750
things going backwards. I do a max
unpool

3398
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:11,760
unpool
 

3399
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,270
unpool
and then I do these what are called

3400
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:13,280
and then I do these what are called
 

3401
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,550
and then I do these what are called
decons which are transpose conss.

3402
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:16,560
decons which are transpose conss.
 

3403
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,470
decons which are transpose conss.
So I do these transpose cons to make the

3404
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:18,480
So I do these transpose cons to make the
 

3405
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,310
So I do these transpose cons to make the
thighs bigger and bigger as I go

3406
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:20,320
thighs bigger and bigger as I go
 

3407
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,310
thighs bigger and bigger as I go
through.

3408
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,320
through.
 

3409
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,790
through.
Okay? And I make them all learnable.

3410
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:24,800
Okay? And I make them all learnable.
 

3411
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,950
Okay? And I make them all learnable.
So incrementally you make it bigger and

3412
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:26,960
So incrementally you make it bigger and
 

3413
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,550
So incrementally you make it bigger and
bigger.

3414
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:28,560
bigger.
 

3415
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:34,149
bigger.
>> Yeah.

3416
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:34,159

 

3417
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,390

>> Yeah.

3418
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:36,400
>> Yeah.
 

3419
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,510
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. So the when you when you make it

3420
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:39,520
>> Yeah. So the when you when you make it
 

3421
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,189
>> Yeah. So the when you when you make it
get bigger it's transpose cons and then

3422
01:19:41,189 --> 01:19:41,199
get bigger it's transpose cons and then
 

3423
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:45,189
get bigger it's transpose cons and then
they're just regular cons inside here.

3424
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:45,199
they're just regular cons inside here.
 

3425
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,189
they're just regular cons inside here.
Yeah. So the first side you have to go

3426
01:19:47,189 --> 01:19:47,199
Yeah. So the first side you have to go
 

3427
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,950
Yeah. So the first side you have to go
transpose then the rest are regular. But

3428
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:48,960
transpose then the rest are regular. But
 

3429
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,229
transpose then the rest are regular. But
from a perspective they're just all

3430
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:50,239
from a perspective they're just all
 

3431
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:51,830
from a perspective they're just all
cons.

3432
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:51,840
cons.
 

3433
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,430
cons.
use a transpose con to save some of

3434
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:53,440
use a transpose con to save some of
 

3435
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,830
use a transpose con to save some of
those multiplications by zeros. That's

3436
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:55,840
those multiplications by zeros. That's
 

3437
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,189
those multiplications by zeros. That's
it.

3438
01:19:59,189 --> 01:19:59,199

 

3439
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,990

Okay, so this is an approach and when

3440
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:02,000
Okay, so this is an approach and when
 

3441
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,910
Okay, so this is an approach and when
people did this approach, they found

3442
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:03,920
people did this approach, they found
 

3443
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,669
people did this approach, they found
that it kind of worked,

3444
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
that it kind of worked,
 

3445
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,229
that it kind of worked,
but it had a problem. And the problem it

3446
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:10,239
but it had a problem. And the problem it
 

3447
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,470
but it had a problem. And the problem it
had was that it forced all of the

3448
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:12,480
had was that it forced all of the
 

3449
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,709
had was that it forced all of the
information about the entire image

3450
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:14,719
information about the entire image
 

3451
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:17,030
information about the entire image
through this bottleneck

3452
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,040
through this bottleneck
 

3453
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,350
through this bottleneck
in the middle which was great from one

3454
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:19,360
in the middle which was great from one
 

3455
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,910
in the middle which was great from one
perspective because you wanted to

3456
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:21,920
perspective because you wanted to
 

3457
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,390
perspective because you wanted to
understand what is going on in the image

3458
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:24,400
understand what is going on in the image
 

3459
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,910
understand what is going on in the image
but it was bad from a different

3460
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:25,920
but it was bad from a different
 

3461
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,229
but it was bad from a different
perspective in that you wanted to have

3462
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:28,239
perspective in that you wanted to have
 

3463
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:31,189
perspective in that you wanted to have
fine grained information about every

3464
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:31,199
fine grained information about every
 

3465
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,790
fine grained information about every
pixel.

3466
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:32,800
pixel.
 

3467
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,870
pixel.
So the problem with this approach is

3468
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:34,880
So the problem with this approach is
 

3469
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,310
So the problem with this approach is
that it didn't separate out

3470
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:38,320
that it didn't separate out
 

3471
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:41,590
that it didn't separate out
um the big picture from details

3472
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:41,600
um the big picture from details
 

3473
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,669
um the big picture from details
and it's making the middle have to do

3474
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:43,679
and it's making the middle have to do
 

3475
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,510
and it's making the middle have to do
the job of both. Whereas semantic

3476
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:45,520
the job of both. Whereas semantic
 

3477
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,430
the job of both. Whereas semantic
segmentation involves not just saying

3478
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:47,440
segmentation involves not just saying
 

3479
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,590
segmentation involves not just saying
this is a cat but this is where the cat

3480
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:49,600
this is a cat but this is where the cat
 

3481
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,350
this is a cat but this is where the cat
ends.

3482
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:53,360

 

3483
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,790

So the idea

3484
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:56,800
So the idea
 

3485
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,870
So the idea
is this is solved by the idea of what's

3486
01:20:58,870 --> 01:20:58,880
is this is solved by the idea of what's
 

3487
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,750
is this is solved by the idea of what's
called a unit.

3488
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:01,760
called a unit.
 

3489
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:06,229
called a unit.
And what a unit did was it said,

3490
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
And what a unit did was it said,
 

3491
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:10,310
And what a unit did was it said,
wouldn't it be great that

3492
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,320
wouldn't it be great that
 

3493
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,630
wouldn't it be great that
when I was looking at the image at a

3494
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:12,640
when I was looking at the image at a
 

3495
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,550
when I was looking at the image at a
higher resolution,

3496
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:14,560
higher resolution,
 

3497
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,870
higher resolution,
I could sneak back and look at the last

3498
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:16,880
I could sneak back and look at the last
 

3499
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,110
I could sneak back and look at the last
time in the processing I was at that

3500
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:19,120
time in the processing I was at that
 

3501
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,270
time in the processing I was at that
resolution.

3502
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:21,280
resolution.
 

3503
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,110
resolution.
Does everyone see the idea? So it says

3504
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:23,120
Does everyone see the idea? So it says
 

3505
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,550
Does everyone see the idea? So it says
like I've done a bunch of processing

3506
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:24,560
like I've done a bunch of processing
 

3507
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,630
like I've done a bunch of processing
that's giving me like information about

3508
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:26,640
that's giving me like information about
 

3509
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,229
that's giving me like information about
the bigger picture, but when I want to

3510
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:30,239
the bigger picture, but when I want to
 

3511
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:32,709
the bigger picture, but when I want to
tell the bigger picture at a higher

3512
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:32,719
tell the bigger picture at a higher
 

3513
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:36,229
tell the bigger picture at a higher
resolution, I should also look at the

3514
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:36,239
resolution, I should also look at the
 

3515
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,229
resolution, I should also look at the
last time I was at that resolution and

3516
01:21:38,229 --> 01:21:38,239
last time I was at that resolution and
 

3517
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:39,590
last time I was at that resolution and
combine that with the big picture

3518
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:39,600
combine that with the big picture
 

3519
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,390
combine that with the big picture
information to get a new higher

3520
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:42,400
information to get a new higher
 

3521
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,790
information to get a new higher
resolution image.

3522
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:44,800
resolution image.
 

3523
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,470
resolution image.
So what it adds is a different kind of

3524
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:48,480
So what it adds is a different kind of
 

3525
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,110
So what it adds is a different kind of
skip connection.

3526
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:51,120
skip connection.
 

3527
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,709
skip connection.
Okay, where the idea is that you want

3528
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:52,719
Okay, where the idea is that you want
 

3529
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:54,550
Okay, where the idea is that you want
information at a certain resolution to

3530
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:54,560
information at a certain resolution to
 

3531
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,870
information at a certain resolution to
be carried through. So in this case,

3532
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:56,880
be carried through. So in this case,
 

3533
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,270
be carried through. So in this case,
this is this crop and concatenate. Crop

3534
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
this is this crop and concatenate. Crop
 

3535
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,510
this is this crop and concatenate. Crop
just means match this shape. Okay,

3536
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:01,520
just means match this shape. Okay,
 

3537
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,830
just means match this shape. Okay,
concatenate means literally copy

3538
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:03,840
concatenate means literally copy
 

3539
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,350
concatenate means literally copy
everything here over here.

3540
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:07,360
everything here over here.
 

3541
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,950
everything here over here.
Add extra channels. So some channels are

3542
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:10,960
Add extra channels. So some channels are
 

3543
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,950
Add extra channels. So some channels are
the transpose conf of this guy

3544
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:14,960
the transpose conf of this guy
 

3545
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,350
the transpose conf of this guy
and some channels are copies of the last

3546
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:17,360
and some channels are copies of the last
 

3547
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,310
and some channels are copies of the last
time I was at this resolution.

3548
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:20,320
time I was at this resolution.
 

3549
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,390
time I was at this resolution.
You follow that by doing regular cons

3550
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:22,400
You follow that by doing regular cons
 

3551
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,470
You follow that by doing regular cons
that combine the information together

3552
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:24,480
that combine the information together
 

3553
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,470
that combine the information together
between what was here last time I was at

3554
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,480
between what was here last time I was at
 

3555
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:31,990
between what was here last time I was at
this resolution and what I have new.

3556
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,000
this resolution and what I have new.
 

3557
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,470
this resolution and what I have new.
So you do that

3558
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:34,480
So you do that
 

3559
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,510
So you do that
and then you process for a while and

3560
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:37,520
and then you process for a while and
 

3561
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,830
and then you process for a while and
then you do it again when you move it to

3562
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:39,840
then you do it again when you move it to
 

3563
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,149
then you do it again when you move it to
the next higher resolution and you do it

3564
01:22:42,149 --> 01:22:42,159
the next higher resolution and you do it
 

3565
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:44,149
the next higher resolution and you do it
again and again until you get back to

3566
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:44,159
again and again until you get back to
 

3567
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,830
again and again until you get back to
the beginning.

3568
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:47,840

 

3569
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:54,550

Okay. So if you think about a unit the

3570
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:54,560
Okay. So if you think about a unit the
 

3571
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,229
Okay. So if you think about a unit the
gradients in the unit flow again what

3572
01:22:58,229 --> 01:22:58,239
gradients in the unit flow again what
 

3573
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,070
gradients in the unit flow again what
I'm not drawing here was not what I

3574
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:00,080
I'm not drawing here was not what I
 

3575
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,270
I'm not drawing here was not what I
didn't draw draw here is that they're

3576
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:01,280
didn't draw draw here is that they're
 

3577
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,110
didn't draw draw here is that they're
also the regular skips that are

3578
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:03,120
also the regular skips that are
 

3579
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,790
also the regular skips that are
happening

3580
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:04,800
happening
 

3581
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,229
happening
okay the regular skips are happening but

3582
01:23:06,229 --> 01:23:06,239
okay the regular skips are happening but
 

3583
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:09,510
okay the regular skips are happening but
these extra skips that are also in these

3584
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:09,520
these extra skips that are also in these
 

3585
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,110
these extra skips that are also in these
crop and concatenates so the gradients

3586
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:11,120
crop and concatenates so the gradients
 

3587
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,470
crop and concatenates so the gradients
are flowing back that way too

3588
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:14,480
are flowing back that way too
 

3589
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:18,709
are flowing back that way too
yeah question

3590
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:18,719

 

3591
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:19,030

Oh,

3592
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,040
Oh,
 

3593
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,149
Oh,
>> the same size.

3594
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:20,159
>> the same size.
 

3595
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:22,229
>> the same size.
>> So, it's just it's to match the size. In

3596
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:22,239
>> So, it's just it's to match the size. In
 

3597
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,669
>> So, it's just it's to match the size. In
this particular example that they took

3598
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:23,679
this particular example that they took
 

3599
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,790
this particular example that they took
this figure from, the output was a 388

3600
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:26,800
this figure from, the output was a 388
 

3601
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,390
this figure from, the output was a 388
by 388. This is like some cell

3602
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:28,400
by 388. This is like some cell
 

3603
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,189
by 388. This is like some cell
segmentation paper and the input image

3604
01:23:31,189 --> 01:23:31,199
segmentation paper and the input image
 

3605
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:34,709
segmentation paper and the input image
was was a different uh size 572 because

3606
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:34,719
was was a different uh size 572 because
 

3607
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,310
was was a different uh size 572 because
there's some boundaries that were being

3608
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:36,320
there's some boundaries that were being
 

3609
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,149
there's some boundaries that were being
ignored and so there's a cropping that's

3610
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:38,159
ignored and so there's a cropping that's
 

3611
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,590
ignored and so there's a cropping that's
just happening as a part of the way

3612
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:39,600
just happening as a part of the way
 

3613
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,910
just happening as a part of the way
these filters are built. The crop isn't

3614
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:41,920
these filters are built. The crop isn't
 

3615
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,629
these filters are built. The crop isn't
important. The idea is

3616
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:44,639
important. The idea is
 

3617
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:47,669
important. The idea is
match up pixel for pixel the information

3618
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:47,679
match up pixel for pixel the information
 

3619
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,830
match up pixel for pixel the information
that was present at the last time I was

3620
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:49,840
that was present at the last time I was
 

3621
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:52,149
that was present at the last time I was
at this scale.

3622
01:23:52,149 --> 01:23:52,159
at this scale.
 

3623
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:58,709
at this scale.
That's the idea in a unit.

3624
01:23:58,709 --> 01:23:58,719

 

3625
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:03,510

So what is it? Let me write that down.

3626
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:03,520

 

3627
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:09,750

bring information

3628
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:09,760

 

3629
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,669

for

3630
01:24:11,669 --> 01:24:11,679
for
 

3631
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:16,709
for
this pixel

3632
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:16,719

 

3633
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:24,310

from earlier processing.

3634
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:24,320

 

3635
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,910

So this is critical um to getting high

3636
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:27,920
So this is critical um to getting high
 

3637
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:32,229
So this is critical um to getting high
quality image level things to work.

3638
01:24:32,229 --> 01:24:32,239
quality image level things to work.
 

3639
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:35,110
quality image level things to work.
And so units aren't just used for things

3640
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:35,120
And so units aren't just used for things
 

3641
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,990
And so units aren't just used for things
like semantic segmentation, but any kind

3642
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:38,000

3643
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,790

01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:40,800
of thing that has an image level target.
 

3645
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,229
of thing that has an image level target.
So for example, whenever you're using u

3646
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:44,239
So for example, whenever you're using u
 

3647
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:46,709
So for example, whenever you're using u

3655
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,110
something to occur at a high resolution,
there's going to be a unit or unit type

there's going to be a unit or unit type
 

3657

So that's the last component that I

3662
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:06,400
So that's the last component that I
 

3663
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,470
So that's the last component that I
wanted to talk about in uh the

01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:08,480
wanted to talk about in uh the
 

3665
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,590
wanted to talk about in uh the

convolutional architectures. Um any
 

3667
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,189

3671
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,189
not get to graph neural nets which is
the next topic I wanted to start. So I

3672
01:25:17,189 --> 01:25:17,199
the next topic I wanted to start. So I
 

3673
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:18,870
the next topic I wanted to start. So I
will start that next lecture. Yeah,

3689
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,870
follow it by a con and the con will have
a learnable way of doing the adding. So

3690
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:40,880
a learnable way of doing the adding. So
 

3691
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,350
a learnable way of doing the adding. So
the question becomes how do I add? Where

the question becomes how do I add? Where
 

3693
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,350
the question becomes how do I add? Where
should I add? And the answer is I don't

3694
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:45,360
should I add? And the answer is I don't
 

3695
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:49,510
should I add? And the answer is I don't
know. Make it learnable. Con.

3696
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:49,520
