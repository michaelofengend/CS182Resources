00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
Is this working? You can hear me? Yes.
 

3
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,150
Is this working? You can hear me? Yes.
Good. Okay, great. Okay, so today's

4
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
Good. Okay, great. Okay, so today's
 

5
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,390
Good. Okay, great. Okay, so today's
lecture is uh is pretty fun. I'm kind of

6
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
lecture is uh is pretty fun. I'm kind of
 

7
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,670
lecture is uh is pretty fun. I'm kind of
excited. We'll see how it goes. Um,

8
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
excited. We'll see how it goes. Um,
 

9
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,670
excited. We'll see how it goes. Um,
we're going to pick up where we left off

10
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
we're going to pick up where we left off
 

11
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,710
we're going to pick up where we left off
last time and we're going to continue

12
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
last time and we're going to continue
 

13
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,550
last time and we're going to continue
building out on trying to understand

14
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
building out on trying to understand
 

15
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,390
building out on trying to understand
optimizers and what optimizers are doing

16
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
optimizers and what optimizers are doing
 

17
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,749
optimizers and what optimizers are doing
and building to talking about this idea

18
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
and building to talking about this idea
 

19
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,469
and building to talking about this idea
of mu or uh maximum update

20
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
of mu or uh maximum update
 

21
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,189
of mu or uh maximum update
parameterization and what that what that

22
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
parameterization and what that what that
 

23
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,990
parameterization and what that what that
means. So the key problem that this MUP

24
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
means. So the key problem that this MUP
 

25
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,510
means. So the key problem that this MUP
idea is trying to solve is the idea that

26
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
idea is trying to solve is the idea that
 

27
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,350
idea is trying to solve is the idea that
look training models is really hard and

28
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
look training models is really hard and
 

29
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,670
look training models is really hard and
in particular training models can be

30
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
in particular training models can be
 

31
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,510
in particular training models can be
very expensive.

32
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
very expensive.
 

33
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,909
very expensive.
One key thing that is required to be

34
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
One key thing that is required to be
 

35
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,150
One key thing that is required to be
able to train models well is one needs

36
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
able to train models well is one needs
 

37
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,990
able to train models well is one needs
to be able to choose the appropriate

38
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,000
to be able to choose the appropriate
 

39
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,469
to be able to choose the appropriate
hyperparameters for the optimization

40
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
hyperparameters for the optimization
 

41
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,070
hyperparameters for the optimization
algorithm that is being used to train

00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
algorithm that is being used to train
 

43
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,550
algorithm that is being used to train
the models. But searching for

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
the models. But searching for
 

45
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,710

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,070
is very very expensive like a training
run can be a million dollars right so

54
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
run can be a million dollars right so
 

55
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,670
run can be a million dollars right so
you can't really say like well let me

56
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
you can't really say like well let me
 

57
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,670
you can't really say like well let me
try with lambda equal to one and lambda

58
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
try with lambda equal to one and lambda
 

59
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,589
try with lambda equal to one and lambda
equal to two you know that's a big

60
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
equal to two you know that's a big
 

61
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,629
equal to two you know that's a big
that's a big deal so can we have

62
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
that's a big deal so can we have
 

63
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,710
that's a big deal so can we have
efficient ways by which we can select

64
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
efficient ways by which we can select
 

65
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,550
efficient ways by which we can select
the hyperparameters without having to do

66
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
the hyperparameters without having to do
 

67
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,309
the hyperparameters without having to do
a full training run on the full model

68
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
a full training run on the full model
 

69
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,189
a full training run on the full model
that we're going to be using and mu

70
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
that we're going to be using and mu
 

71
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,270
that we're going to be using and mu
brings a way of doing that of scaling

72
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
brings a way of doing that of scaling
 

73
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,830
brings a way of doing that of scaling
parameters from a smaller model to a uh

74
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
parameters from a smaller model to a uh
 

75
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,510
parameters from a smaller model to a uh
bigger model. So that's kind of what

76
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
bigger model. So that's kind of what
 

77
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,830
bigger model. So that's kind of what
we're going to be uh building towards

78
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
we're going to be uh building towards
 

79
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,550
we're going to be uh building towards
talking about. I was thinking maybe I

80
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
talking about. I was thinking maybe I
 

81
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,110
talking about. I was thinking maybe I
would get to muon uh the muon optimizer

82
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
would get to muon uh the muon optimizer
 

83
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,189
would get to muon uh the muon optimizer
today as well, but I'm probably only

84
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
today as well, but I'm probably only
 

85
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,510
today as well, but I'm probably only
going to be giving a sense of what it is

86
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
going to be giving a sense of what it is
 

87
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,950
going to be giving a sense of what it is
and then we will talk a little bit about

88
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
and then we will talk a little bit about
 

89
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,029
and then we will talk a little bit about
it in the in the following lecture.

90
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
it in the in the following lecture.
 

91
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,670
it in the in the following lecture.
Okay, any questions before I start?

92
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
Okay, any questions before I start?
 

93
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,550
Okay, any questions before I start?
Okay, good.

94
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
Okay, good.
 

95
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,670
Okay, good.
So last time we started with talking

96
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
So last time we started with talking
 

97
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,909
So last time we started with talking
about uh different matrix norms and we

98
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
about uh different matrix norms and we
 

99
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,430
about uh different matrix norms and we
were left with this question of what is

100
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
were left with this question of what is
 

101
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,110
were left with this question of what is
a good matrix norm to be thinking about

102
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,120
a good matrix norm to be thinking about
 

103
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,670
a good matrix norm to be thinking about
when we're doing deep learning. Right?

104
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
when we're doing deep learning. Right?
 

105
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,270
when we're doing deep learning. Right?
We observed that there is a natural

106
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
We observed that there is a natural
 

107
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,589
We observed that there is a natural
structure to deep learning problems in

108
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
structure to deep learning problems in
 

109
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,390
structure to deep learning problems in
that you have vectors that are your

110
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
that you have vectors that are your
 

111
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,670
that you have vectors that are your
inputs multiplied by matrices that are

112
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
inputs multiplied by matrices that are
 

113
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,469
inputs multiplied by matrices that are
your weight vectors. And when we think

114
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
your weight vectors. And when we think
 

115
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,629
your weight vectors. And when we think
about just all of our parameters put

116
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
about just all of our parameters put
 

117
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,630
about just all of our parameters put
into one big giant vector, for example,

118
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
into one big giant vector, for example,
 

119
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,909
into one big giant vector, for example,
as standard atom might do, we aren't

120
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
as standard atom might do, we aren't
 

121
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,589
as standard atom might do, we aren't
really taking into account the structure

122
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
really taking into account the structure
 

123
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,389
really taking into account the structure
of this problem, right? So we said well

124
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
of this problem, right? So we said well
 

125
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,149
of this problem, right? So we said well
there's maybe some advantage to thinking

126
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
there's maybe some advantage to thinking
 

127
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,550
there's maybe some advantage to thinking
about things in their true structure and

128
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,560
about things in their true structure and
 

129
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,870
about things in their true structure and
so we started looking at things we

130
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
so we started looking at things we
 

131
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,630
so we started looking at things we
started looking at matrices and then we

132
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
started looking at matrices and then we
 

133
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,550
started looking at matrices and then we
said okay can we formulate this

134
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
said okay can we formulate this
 

135
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,430
said okay can we formulate this
optimization problem in the context of

136
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
optimization problem in the context of
 

137
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,750
optimization problem in the context of
uh of matrices and we said what is the

138
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
uh of matrices and we said what is the
 

139
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,150
uh of matrices and we said what is the
right norm that we want to look at well

140
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
right norm that we want to look at well
 

141
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,470
right norm that we want to look at well
we remembered for example that Xavier

142
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
we remembered for example that Xavier
 

143
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,750
we remembered for example that Xavier
initialization brought in this one overd

144
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
initialization brought in this one overd
 

145
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,430
initialization brought in this one overd
kind of scaling right everyone remembers

146
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
kind of scaling right everyone remembers
 

147
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,790
kind of scaling right everyone remembers
that and that motivated last time for us

148
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
that and that motivated last time for us
 

149
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,509
that and that motivated last time for us
the idea of looking at the RMS or the

150
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
the idea of looking at the RMS or the
 

151
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,590
the idea of looking at the RMS or the
root mean square norm. Everyone remember

152
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
root mean square norm. Everyone remember
 

153
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,829
root mean square norm. Everyone remember
we talked about the RMS norm and you

154
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
we talked about the RMS norm and you
 

155
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,110
we talked about the RMS norm and you
should have seen it in discussion as

156
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
should have seen it in discussion as
 

157
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,870
should have seen it in discussion as
well. Okay, so this is familiar.

158
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
well. Okay, so this is familiar.
 

159
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,670
well. Okay, so this is familiar.
So we have this RMS to RMS norm for a

160
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
So we have this RMS to RMS norm for a
 

161
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,750
So we have this RMS to RMS norm for a
matrix and we're building off of the

162
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
matrix and we're building off of the
 

163
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,150
matrix and we're building off of the
induced matrix uh norm definition for

164
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
induced matrix uh norm definition for
 

165
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,790
induced matrix uh norm definition for
that and we did this last time. So just

166
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
that and we did this last time. So just
 

167
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,389
that and we did this last time. So just
writing it out here for your uh

168
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
writing it out here for your uh
 

169
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,230
writing it out here for your uh
to recap.

170
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
to recap.
 

171
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,710
to recap.
I don't know why this is showing up,

172
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720

 

173
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,350

but basically when I'm looking at the

174
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
but basically when I'm looking at the
 

175
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,389
but basically when I'm looking at the
induced RMS to RMS norm, I'm saying if

176
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
induced RMS to RMS norm, I'm saying if
 

177
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,790
induced RMS to RMS norm, I'm saying if
my input vector has RMS norm at most

178
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
my input vector has RMS norm at most
 

179
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,310
my input vector has RMS norm at most
one, what is the maximum scaling that my

180
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
one, what is the maximum scaling that my
 

181
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,030
one, what is the maximum scaling that my
matrix can do in RMS norm to that

182
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
matrix can do in RMS norm to that
 

183
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,110
matrix can do in RMS norm to that
vector?

184
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
vector?
 

185
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,110
vector?
And the nice thing about this RMS norm

186
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
And the nice thing about this RMS norm
 

187
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,350
And the nice thing about this RMS norm
is that it's just essentially a scaled

188
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
is that it's just essentially a scaled
 

189
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,470
is that it's just essentially a scaled
version of our very, you know,

190
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
version of our very, you know,
 

191
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,509
version of our very, you know,
well-known two norm. So I can rewrite

192
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
well-known two norm. So I can rewrite
 

193
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,310
well-known two norm. So I can rewrite
this in terms of the two norms. These

194
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
this in terms of the two norms. These
 

195
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,310
this in terms of the two norms. These
are just constants and I can pull them

196
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
are just constants and I can pull them
 

197
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,470
are just constants and I can pull them
out and what I get here is the

198
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
out and what I get here is the
 

199
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,630
out and what I get here is the
optimization problem that is familiar to

200
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
optimization problem that is familiar to
 

201
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,710
optimization problem that is familiar to
me. And what is this quantity in the

202
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
me. And what is this quantity in the
 

203
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,110
me. And what is this quantity in the
pink box? This is just the spectral

204
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
pink box? This is just the spectral
 

205
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,110
pink box? This is just the spectral
norm, right? This is saying what is the

206
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
norm, right? This is saying what is the
 

207
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,389
norm, right? This is saying what is the
maximum scaling I can have for a vector

208
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:28,399
maximum scaling I can have for a vector
 

209
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,590
maximum scaling I can have for a vector
in the two norm sense. Everyone with me?

210
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
in the two norm sense. Everyone with me?
 

211
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,310
in the two norm sense. Everyone with me?
This is all recap revision. Everyone's

212
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
This is all recap revision. Everyone's
 

213
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,269
This is all recap revision. Everyone's
100% with me here. Right?

214
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
100% with me here. Right?
 

215
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,590
100% with me here. Right?
So what is important that I want you to

216
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
So what is important that I want you to
 

217
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,750
So what is important that I want you to
notice

218
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
notice
 

219
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,389
notice
is what has come into play here now by

220
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
is what has come into play here now by
 

221
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,190
is what has come into play here now by
naturally thinking about the RMS norm is

222
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,200
naturally thinking about the RMS norm is
 

223
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,389
naturally thinking about the RMS norm is
that the dimensions of the matrix have

224
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
that the dimensions of the matrix have
 

225
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,590
that the dimensions of the matrix have
kind of automatically shown up. Okay.

226
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
kind of automatically shown up. Okay.
 

227
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,630
kind of automatically shown up. Okay.
Everyone seeing this? So we wanted to be

228
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
Everyone seeing this? So we wanted to be
 

229
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,630
Everyone seeing this? So we wanted to be
able to take account of the structure of

230
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
able to take account of the structure of
 

231
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,350
able to take account of the structure of
the problem and the RMS norm you know we

232
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
the problem and the RMS norm you know we
 

233
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,030
the problem and the RMS norm you know we
it was motivated to us from Xavier

234
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
it was motivated to us from Xavier
 

235
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,750
it was motivated to us from Xavier
initialization but it's it's coming in

236
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
initialization but it's it's coming in
 

237
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,509
initialization but it's it's coming in
um naturally in a way that kind of we

238
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
um naturally in a way that kind of we
 

239
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,790
um naturally in a way that kind of we
would have expected from what we saw

240
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
would have expected from what we saw
 

241
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,030
would have expected from what we saw
with Xavier.

242
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
with Xavier.
 

243
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,670
with Xavier.
Okay, good.

244
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
Okay, good.
 

245
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,430
Okay, good.
The other thing we talked about last

246
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
The other thing we talked about last
 

247
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,710
The other thing we talked about last
time was the ha that we had this

248
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
time was the ha that we had this
 

249
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,590
time was the ha that we had this
optimizer recipe of sorts, right? where

250
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
optimizer recipe of sorts, right? where
 

251
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,350
optimizer recipe of sorts, right? where
we said okay let's look at this inner

252
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
we said okay let's look at this inner
 

253
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,550
we said okay let's look at this inner
product and we'll say

254
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
product and we'll say
 

255
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,110
product and we'll say
let's choose an appropriate norm and

256
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
let's choose an appropriate norm and
 

257
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,230
let's choose an appropriate norm and
let's choose how big we want to take a

258
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,240
let's choose how big we want to take a
 

259
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,150
let's choose how big we want to take a
step in that norm sense so we'll choose

260
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
step in that norm sense so we'll choose
 

261
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,990
step in that norm sense so we'll choose
this norm we'll choose this ADA and then

262
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
this norm we'll choose this ADA and then
 

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,710
this norm we'll choose this ADA and then
by solving this optimization problem

264
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
by solving this optimization problem
 

265
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,949
by solving this optimization problem
we're going to get an optimization

266
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:44,959
we're going to get an optimization
 

267
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,910
we're going to get an optimization
algorithm okay everyone remember that

268
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
algorithm okay everyone remember that
 

269
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,110
algorithm okay everyone remember that
this was kind of our recipe.

270
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
this was kind of our recipe.
 

271
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,710
this was kind of our recipe.
And when we think about choosing the

272
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
And when we think about choosing the
 

273
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,030
And when we think about choosing the
norm, well, the way to choose the norm

274
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
norm, well, the way to choose the norm
 

275
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,110
norm, well, the way to choose the norm
is to say, let's look at the problem.

276
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
is to say, let's look at the problem.
 

277
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,030
is to say, let's look at the problem.
Let's try to understand maybe something

278
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
Let's try to understand maybe something
 

279
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,550
Let's try to understand maybe something
about the geometry, something about the

280
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
about the geometry, something about the
 

281
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,829
about the geometry, something about the
structure. Maybe there's some properties

282
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
structure. Maybe there's some properties
 

283
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,110
structure. Maybe there's some properties
of the problem that can help us choose

284
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
of the problem that can help us choose
 

285
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,870
of the problem that can help us choose
that norm.

286
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
that norm.
 

287
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,750
that norm.
But what about ADA? Choice of ADA is

288
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
But what about ADA? Choice of ADA is
 

289
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,750
But what about ADA? Choice of ADA is
still a hyperparameter. We don't really

290
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
still a hyperparameter. We don't really
 

291
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,470
still a hyperparameter. We don't really
have necessarily a

292
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
have necessarily a
 

293
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,550
have necessarily a
way or a principled way that tells us

294
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,560
way or a principled way that tells us
 

295
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,670
way or a principled way that tells us
this is the ADA you should choose or

296
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
this is the ADA you should choose or
 

297
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,190
this is the ADA you should choose or
that is the ADA you should choose. the

298
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
that is the ADA you should choose. the
 

299
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,470
that is the ADA you should choose. the
way that we would choose ADA, I might

300
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
way that we would choose ADA, I might
 

301
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,150
way that we would choose ADA, I might
still be doing a hyperparameter sweep.

302
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
still be doing a hyperparameter sweep.
 

303
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,910
still be doing a hyperparameter sweep.
You know, how how how big are we willing

304
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:21,920
You know, how how how big are we willing
 

305
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,389
You know, how how how big are we willing
to make our normal?

306
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
to make our normal?
 

307
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,470
to make our normal?
Okay, but once we choose both of these

308
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
Okay, but once we choose both of these
 

309
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,629
Okay, but once we choose both of these
things, we basically are going to get an

310
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639
things, we basically are going to get an
 

311
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,790
things, we basically are going to get an
optimizer. Everyone remember this

312
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
optimizer. Everyone remember this
 

313
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,670
optimizer. Everyone remember this
recipe? Okay, good.

314
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680

 

315
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,670

So now, can we use this, you know,

316
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
So now, can we use this, you know,
 

317
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,949
So now, can we use this, you know,
induced RMS to RMS norm in our optimizer

318
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
induced RMS to RMS norm in our optimizer
 

319
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,870
induced RMS to RMS norm in our optimizer
recipe is a natural question that you

320
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
recipe is a natural question that you
 

321
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,269
recipe is a natural question that you
want to ask, right?

322
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
want to ask, right?
 

323
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,110
want to ask, right?
For example,

324
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
For example,
 

325
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,269
For example,
if we wanted to have some constraint

326
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
if we wanted to have some constraint
 

327
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,870
if we wanted to have some constraint
like the change in your RMS to RMS norm,

328
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
like the change in your RMS to RMS norm,
 

329
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,030
like the change in your RMS to RMS norm,
I'm just calling it RMS star over there,

330
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
I'm just calling it RMS star over there,
 

331
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,230
I'm just calling it RMS star over there,
is upper bounded by some gamma. And you

332
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
is upper bounded by some gamma. And you
 

333
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,590
is upper bounded by some gamma. And you
know last lecture we were calling these

334
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
know last lecture we were calling these
 

335
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,670
know last lecture we were calling these
gamas adas. Here I'm going to start uh

336
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
gamas adas. Here I'm going to start uh
 

337
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,150
gamas adas. Here I'm going to start uh
calling them gamma. You'll see why as I

338
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
calling them gamma. You'll see why as I
 

339
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,509
calling them gamma. You'll see why as I
proceed through the lecture because I

340
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
proceed through the lecture because I
 

341
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,190
proceed through the lecture because I
want to use ADA for something else.

342
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
want to use ADA for something else.
 

343
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,509
want to use ADA for something else.
Okay.

344
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519

 

345
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,069

So here

346
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
So here
 

347
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,550
So here
we know that basically this is just a

348
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
we know that basically this is just a
 

349
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,509
we know that basically this is just a
scaling of this spectral norm and so I

350
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
scaling of this spectral norm and so I
 

351
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,310
scaling of this spectral norm and so I
can convert back and forth between these

352
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
can convert back and forth between these
 

353
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,069
can convert back and forth between these
two things.

354
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
two things.
 

355
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,590
two things.
But what I want to call out

356
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
But what I want to call out
 

357
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,790
But what I want to call out
is by thinking in terms of the RMS norm,

358
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
is by thinking in terms of the RMS norm,
 

359
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,430
is by thinking in terms of the RMS norm,
we've refocused our attention in a sense

360
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
we've refocused our attention in a sense
 

361
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,710
we've refocused our attention in a sense
on this singular hyperparameter gamma.

362
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
on this singular hyperparameter gamma.
 

363
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,230
on this singular hyperparameter gamma.
There's only one hyperparameter here

364
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
There's only one hyperparameter here
 

365
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,310
There's only one hyperparameter here
that we have to worry about. But if I

366
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
that we have to worry about. But if I
 

367
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,069
that we have to worry about. But if I
can focus on choosing this

368
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
can focus on choosing this
 

369
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,550
can focus on choosing this
hyperparameter gamma,

370
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,560
hyperparameter gamma,
 

371
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,670
hyperparameter gamma,
the nature of the RSMS norm

372
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680
the nature of the RSMS norm
 

373
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,910
the nature of the RSMS norm
automatically is bringing in this D1

374
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
automatically is bringing in this D1
 

375
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,550
automatically is bringing in this D1
over D2, the dimensions of the matrix.

376
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
over D2, the dimensions of the matrix.
 

377
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,350
over D2, the dimensions of the matrix.
And so the specific geometry of the

378
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
And so the specific geometry of the
 

379
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,069
And so the specific geometry of the
specific layer comes into play just by

380
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
specific layer comes into play just by
 

381
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,230
specific layer comes into play just by
looking at this norm instead of looking

382
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
looking at this norm instead of looking
 

383
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,790
looking at this norm instead of looking
at say for example directly the spectral

384
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
at say for example directly the spectral
 

385
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,710
at say for example directly the spectral
norm. Okay. Okay, so it's a scaling, but

386
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
norm. Okay. Okay, so it's a scaling, but
 

387
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,470
norm. Okay. Okay, so it's a scaling, but
we're bringing in the dimensions of the

388
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
we're bringing in the dimensions of the
 

389
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,269
we're bringing in the dimensions of the
matrix. Okay, and the fan in and the fan

390
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
matrix. Okay, and the fan in and the fan
 

391
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,430
matrix. Okay, and the fan in and the fan
out. And how big is, you know, is is it

392
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,440
out. And how big is, you know, is is it
 

393
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,790
out. And how big is, you know, is is it
a big layer going to a small layer, a

394
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
a big layer going to a small layer, a
 

395
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,110
a big layer going to a small layer, a
small layer going to big layer, whatever

396
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
small layer going to big layer, whatever
 

397
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,829
small layer going to big layer, whatever
that is,

398
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
that is,
 

399
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,310
that is,
everyone see that?

400
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
everyone see that?
 

401
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,189
everyone see that?
Okay.

402
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
Okay.
 

403
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,350
Okay.
Okay. So this is good for us because if

404
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
Okay. So this is good for us because if
 

405
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,189
Okay. So this is good for us because if
you remember one of the things that we

406
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
you remember one of the things that we
 

407
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,509
you remember one of the things that we
were trying to do was we were trying to

408
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:39,519
were trying to do was we were trying to
 

409
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,790
were trying to do was we were trying to
say can we find a better optimizer. Our

410
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
say can we find a better optimizer. Our
 

411
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,030
say can we find a better optimizer. Our
idea for finding a better optimizer was

412
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
idea for finding a better optimizer was
 

413
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,750
idea for finding a better optimizer was
to say well maybe we should look at the

414
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
to say well maybe we should look at the
 

415
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,949
to say well maybe we should look at the
specifics of the geometry of each layer.

416
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
specifics of the geometry of each layer.
 

417
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,590
specifics of the geometry of each layer.
And just having one uniform step size

418
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:53,600
And just having one uniform step size
 

419
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,110
And just having one uniform step size
that operates across the entire

420
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
that operates across the entire
 

421
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,990
that operates across the entire
uh network might not be a good idea

422
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
uh network might not be a good idea
 

423
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,710
uh network might not be a good idea
because different step sizes might work

424
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:02,720
because different step sizes might work
 

425
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,629
because different step sizes might work
better for different layers. Right?

426
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:08,639
better for different layers. Right?
 

427
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,710
better for different layers. Right?
Now think about it. If you had if you

428
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
Now think about it. If you had if you
 

429
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,790
Now think about it. If you had if you
wanted to optimize a network and you

430
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
wanted to optimize a network and you
 

431
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,069
wanted to optimize a network and you
wanted to optimize your hyperparameters

432
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
wanted to optimize your hyperparameters
 

433
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,069
wanted to optimize your hyperparameters
to be good on a layerbylayer basis,

434
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
to be good on a layerbylayer basis,
 

435
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,350
to be good on a layerbylayer basis,
right? You have a different

436
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
right? You have a different
 

437
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,110
right? You have a different
hyperparameter for layer 1, different

438
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
hyperparameter for layer 1, different
 

439
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,629
hyperparameter for layer 1, different
one for layer two, a different one for

440
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
one for layer two, a different one for
 

441
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,590
one for layer two, a different one for
layer three. That hyperparameter search

442
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
layer three. That hyperparameter search
 

443
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,509
layer three. That hyperparameter search
has now suddenly got even more

444
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
has now suddenly got even more
 

445
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,030
has now suddenly got even more
complicated, right? It was already

446
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
complicated, right? It was already
 

447
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,030
complicated, right? It was already
complicated to begin with. Trying to do

448
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,040
complicated to begin with. Trying to do
 

449
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,509
complicated to begin with. Trying to do
it on a layerbylayer basis is even more

450
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
it on a layerbylayer basis is even more
 

451
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,509
it on a layerbylayer basis is even more
complicated.

452
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
complicated.
 

453
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,629
complicated.
So, we don't want to do that in general.

454
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
So, we don't want to do that in general.
 

455
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,230
So, we don't want to do that in general.
However,

456
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
However,
 

457
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,150
However,
if we can have some appropriate scaling

458
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
if we can have some appropriate scaling
 

459
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,710
if we can have some appropriate scaling
based on the geometry of the layer come

460
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
based on the geometry of the layer come
 

461
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,670
based on the geometry of the layer come
into play by the choice of norm that we

462
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
into play by the choice of norm that we
 

463
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,749
into play by the choice of norm that we
look at,

464
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
look at,
 

465
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,269
look at,
we can still maybe have a limited

466
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
we can still maybe have a limited
 

467
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,710
we can still maybe have a limited
you know limited search of

468
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
you know limited search of
 

469
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,470
you know limited search of
hyperparameter. We can only think about

470
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,480
hyperparameter. We can only think about
 

471
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,550
hyperparameter. We can only think about
searching over the hyperparameters gamma

472
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
searching over the hyperparameters gamma
 

473
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,470
searching over the hyperparameters gamma
but still get different effects in

474
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
but still get different effects in
 

475
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,470
but still get different effects in
different layers because of this d1 by

476
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
different layers because of this d1 by
 

477
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,470
different layers because of this d1 by
d2 scaling.

478
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
d2 scaling.
 

479
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,189
d2 scaling.
Does everyone see that?

480
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
Does everyone see that?
 

481
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,790
Does everyone see that?
questions.

482
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800

 

483
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,790

Yeah. No. Okay. Good.

484
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800

 

485
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,430

So, remember last time

486
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
So, remember last time
 

487
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,189
So, remember last time
we did one version of this problem

488
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
we did one version of this problem
 

489
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,670
we did one version of this problem
where we looked at specifically the

490
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
where we looked at specifically the
 

491
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:53,430
where we looked at specifically the
following, right? We looked at

492
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440

 

493
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,030

Right? Right? We did this specifically

494
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
Right? Right? We did this specifically
 

495
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,430
Right? Right? We did this specifically
looking at the spectral norm

496
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440

 

497
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,470

and what we got out was a simplified

498
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
and what we got out was a simplified
 

499
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,510
and what we got out was a simplified
version of the shampoo optimizer.

500
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:05,520
version of the shampoo optimizer.
 

501
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,829
version of the shampoo optimizer.
Everyone remember that where basically

502
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:07,839
Everyone remember that where basically
 

503
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,870
Everyone remember that where basically
we did this uh orthogonalization in some

504
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
we did this uh orthogonalization in some
 

505
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,710
we did this uh orthogonalization in some
sense we got out this UV transpose was

506
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
sense we got out this UV transpose was
 

507
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,150
sense we got out this UV transpose was
the optimal direction. Everyone remember

508
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
the optimal direction. Everyone remember
 

509
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,829
the optimal direction. Everyone remember
that?

510
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
that?
 

511
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,909
that?
Um,

512
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
Um,
 

513
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,990
Um,
so if I wanted to instead of the

514
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,000
so if I wanted to instead of the
 

515
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,230
so if I wanted to instead of the
spectral norm,

516
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
spectral norm,
 

517
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,270
spectral norm,
think about this RMS norm. Well, the RMS

518
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
think about this RMS norm. Well, the RMS
 

519
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,950
think about this RMS norm. Well, the RMS
norm is really just a scaled version

520
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
norm is really just a scaled version
 

521
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,110
norm is really just a scaled version
of the spectral norm, right? So when I'm

522
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
of the spectral norm, right? So when I'm
 

523
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,270
of the spectral norm, right? So when I'm
going to do my I'm going to solve this

524
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
going to do my I'm going to solve this
 

525
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,110
going to do my I'm going to solve this
optimization problem out, what I'm going

526
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
optimization problem out, what I'm going
 

527
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,830
optimization problem out, what I'm going
to get is going to be a very similar the

528
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
to get is going to be a very similar the
 

529
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,669
to get is going to be a very similar the
algebra is going to be very similar to

530
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
algebra is going to be very similar to
 

531
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,710
algebra is going to be very similar to
what I did for the calculation I did in

532
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
what I did for the calculation I did in
 

533
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,710
what I did for the calculation I did in
class last time. I'm not going to do it

534
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
class last time. I'm not going to do it
 

535
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,110
class last time. I'm not going to do it
out here right now. You can see

536
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
out here right now. You can see
 

537
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,270
out here right now. You can see
basically what's going to happen is that

538
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
basically what's going to happen is that
 

539
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,909
basically what's going to happen is that
all you're going to get is this scaling

540
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:53,919
all you're going to get is this scaling
 

541
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,909
all you're going to get is this scaling
factor kind of moving around in

542
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
factor kind of moving around in
 

543
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,549
factor kind of moving around in
different places. Okay.

544
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559

 

545
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,310

what I'm not going to talk about in this

546
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
what I'm not going to talk about in this
 

547
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,470
what I'm not going to talk about in this
lecture but I will probably talk about

548
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,480
lecture but I will probably talk about
 

549
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,190
lecture but I will probably talk about
in the next lecture maybe if I have time

550
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
in the next lecture maybe if I have time
 

551
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,430
in the next lecture maybe if I have time
I can talk about it at the end of this

552
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
I can talk about it at the end of this
 

553
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,710
I can talk about it at the end of this
lecture I'm not I'm just not sure how

554
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
lecture I'm not I'm just not sure how
 

555
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,070
lecture I'm not I'm just not sure how
how much time we will end up having

556
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
how much time we will end up having
 

557
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,070
how much time we will end up having
this exact idea leads to what is now

558
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
this exact idea leads to what is now
 

559
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,950
this exact idea leads to what is now
called the muon optimizer okay

560
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:22,960
called the muon optimizer okay
 

561
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,789
called the muon optimizer okay
so let me tell you why the muon

562
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:24,799
so let me tell you why the muon
 

563
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,029
so let me tell you why the muon
optimizer is is important in a sense

564
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039

 

565
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,549

571
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,310
couple of other authors is uh the the
creator of of Muan. But what this shows

572
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
creator of of Muan. But what this shows
 

573
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,510
creator of of Muan. But what this shows
is on the x- axis basically uh time and

574
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
is on the x- axis basically uh time and
 

575
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,150
is on the x- axis basically uh time and
the y- axis is validation loss and

576
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
the y- axis is validation loss and
 

577
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,029
the y- axis is validation loss and
you're seeing how different optimizers

578
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
you're seeing how different optimizers
 

579
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,669
you're seeing how different optimizers
are behaving.

580
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
are behaving.
 

581
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,310
are behaving.
Adam is what you see in blue and what

582
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
Adam is what you see in blue and what
 

583
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,190
Adam is what you see in blue and what
you see in muon is it's massively

584
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
you see in muon is it's massively
 

585
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,950
you see in muon is it's massively
beating basically all of these other

586
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
beating basically all of these other
 

587
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,230
beating basically all of these other
optimizers um even these shampoo

588
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
optimizers um even these shampoo
 

589
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,710
optimizers um even these shampoo
variants. Okay, soap as I mentioned last

590
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
variants. Okay, soap as I mentioned last
 

591
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,510
variants. Okay, soap as I mentioned last
time is a variation of shampoo that is

592
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:11,520
time is a variation of shampoo that is
 

593
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,750
time is a variation of shampoo that is
specifically adapted for atom and uh as

594
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:15,760
specifically adapted for atom and uh as
 

595
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,830
specifically adapted for atom and uh as
is pointed out here soap can do better

596
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:17,840
is pointed out here soap can do better
 

597
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,710
is pointed out here soap can do better
but this is just a a kind of a rough

598
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
but this is just a a kind of a rough
 

599
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,070
but this is just a a kind of a rough
implementation of soap which is why it's

600
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
implementation of soap which is why it's
 

601
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,909
implementation of soap which is why it's
not performing as well as it uh as well

602
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:23,919
not performing as well as it uh as well
 

603
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,990
not performing as well as it uh as well
as it could but what I want to highlight

604
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
as it could but what I want to highlight
 

605
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,669
as it could but what I want to highlight
here is that the best one is muan

606
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
here is that the best one is muan
 

607
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,430
here is that the best one is muan
everyone see that okay

608
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
everyone see that okay
 

609
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,310
everyone see that okay
so muan uh has just had a tremend

610
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
so muan uh has just had a tremend
 

611

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
the as the baseline this was uh
 

643
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,510
the as the baseline this was uh
around 45 minutes. Okay. And then people

644
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
around 45 minutes. Okay. And then people
 

645
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,029
around 45 minutes. Okay. And then people
were optimizing, building on this,

646
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,039
were optimizing, building on this,
 

647
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,350
were optimizing, building on this,
building on this. And as you can see,

648
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
building on this. And as you can see,
 

649
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,070
building on this. And as you can see,
this is kind of the progression of how

650
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,080
this is kind of the progression of how
 

651
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,590
this is kind of the progression of how
uh

652
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,600
uh
 

653
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,590
uh
how long it took to get to a certain

654
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
how long it took to get to a certain
 

655
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,470
how long it took to get to a certain
validation loss level

656
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,480
validation loss level
 

657
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,590
validation loss level
for this particular nano GPT uh

658
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
for this particular nano GPT uh
 

659
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,789
for this particular nano GPT uh
benchmark. In a sense,

660
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799
benchmark. In a sense,
 

661
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,230
benchmark. In a sense,
I want to call your attention to this

662
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
I want to call your attention to this
 

663
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,789
I want to call your attention to this
point. What happened here is the

664
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799
point. What happened here is the
 

665
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,029
point. What happened here is the
introduction of the muon optimizer set

666
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,039
introduction of the muon optimizer set
 

667
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,750
introduction of the muon optimizer set
this new record

668
00:20:59,750 --> 00:20:59,760
this new record
 

669
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,310
this new record
and boom suddenly there's like tweak

670
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
and boom suddenly there's like tweak
 

671
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,070
and boom suddenly there's like tweak
after tweak after tweak improvements on

672
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,080
after tweak after tweak improvements on
 

673
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,029
after tweak after tweak improvements on
this that have really uh changed how uh

674
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
this that have really uh changed how uh
 

675
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,190
this that have really uh changed how uh
people are thinking about optimization

676
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200
people are thinking about optimization
 

677
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,510
people are thinking about optimization
and this got muon basically a lot of

678
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
and this got muon basically a lot of
 

679
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,990
and this got muon basically a lot of
attention from industry in terms of

680
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
attention from industry in terms of
 

681
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,630
attention from industry in terms of
changing how we're actually doing uh

682
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640
changing how we're actually doing uh
 

683
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,390
changing how we're actually doing uh
optimization of these really large

684
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
optimization of these really large
 

685
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,990
optimization of these really large
models even at scale And so 2025

686
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
models even at scale And so 2025
 

687
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,710
models even at scale And so 2025
uh just February so this year actually

688
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:28,720
uh just February so this year actually
 

689
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,310
uh just February so this year actually
2025 is still here

690
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:32,320
2025 is still here
 

691
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,230
2025 is still here
um the Kimmy model was released and

692
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,240
um the Kimmy model was released and
 

693
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,149
um the Kimmy model was released and
Kimmy is now a trillion parameter model.

694
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:40,159
Kimmy is now a trillion parameter model.
 

695
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,750
Kimmy is now a trillion parameter model.
Okay, so it's one of the uh frontier

696
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:43,760
Okay, so it's one of the uh frontier
 

697
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,750
Okay, so it's one of the uh frontier
models developed out of I think the

698
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:45,760
models developed out of I think the
 

699
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,390
models developed out of I think the
moonshot AI lab in uh in China

700
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,400
moonshot AI lab in uh in China
 

701
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,230
moonshot AI lab in uh in China
and they published this paper saying

702
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:52,240
and they published this paper saying
 

703
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,470
and they published this paper saying
muon is scalable for LLM training. So

704
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480
muon is scalable for LLM training. So
 

705
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,590
muon is scalable for LLM training. So
they took the core idea of muon and

706
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
they took the core idea of muon and
 

707
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,510
they took the core idea of muon and
identified that there are actually some

708
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
identified that there are actually some
 

709
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,029
identified that there are actually some
issues that come up when muon is uh used

710
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,039
issues that come up when muon is uh used
 

711
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,750
issues that come up when muon is uh used
in the context of uh attention blocks

712
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
in the context of uh attention blocks
 

713
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,270
in the context of uh attention blocks
and then there's some other issues that

714
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:07,280
and then there's some other issues that
 

715
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,029
and then there's some other issues that
come up with scaling with some of the

716
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
come up with scaling with some of the
 

717
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,630
come up with scaling with some of the
parameters becoming too small. They

718
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,640
parameters becoming too small. They
 

719
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,950
parameters becoming too small. They
introduced this idea called muon clip

720
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
introduced this idea called muon clip
 

721
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,710
introduced this idea called muon clip
which uh I'm not going to talk about. I

722
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
which uh I'm not going to talk about. I
 

723
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,070
which uh I'm not going to talk about. I
don't know maybe maybe we'll have time

724
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
don't know maybe maybe we'll have time
 

725
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,190
don't know maybe maybe we'll have time
to talk about maybe we won't have time

726
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,200
to talk about maybe we won't have time
 

727
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,990
to talk about maybe we won't have time
to talk time to talk about but the key

728
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
to talk time to talk about but the key
 

729
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,470
to talk time to talk about but the key
idea is that suddenly you can really

730
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
idea is that suddenly you can really
 

731
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,510
idea is that suddenly you can really
change the game in terms of you know how

732
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
change the game in terms of you know how
 

733
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,310
change the game in terms of you know how
much time and money is spent in terms of

734
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,320
much time and money is spent in terms of
 

735
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,669
much time and money is spent in terms of
scaling these models and so what the

736
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
scaling these models and so what the
 

737
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,909
scaling these models and so what the
work from Kim shows is that well you

738
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:35,919
work from Kim shows is that well you
 

739
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,590
work from Kim shows is that well you
know it's really nice to do this on some

740
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:37,600
know it's really nice to do this on some
 

741
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,909
know it's really nice to do this on some
nano GPT model which is tiny and you can

742
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
nano GPT model which is tiny and you can
 

743
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,390
nano GPT model which is tiny and you can
run on your in 45 minutes but to doing

744
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,400
run on your in 45 minutes but to doing
 

745
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,750
run on your in 45 minutes but to doing
this to doing this on a trillion

746
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
this to doing this on a trillion
 

747
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,149
this to doing this on a trillion
parameter model shows that these ideas

748
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:46,159
parameter model shows that these ideas
 

749
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,230
parameter model shows that these ideas
that we're talking about for the muon

750
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
that we're talking about for the muon
 

751
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,310
that we're talking about for the muon
optimizer, for the shampoo optimizer,

752
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,320
optimizer, for the shampoo optimizer,
 

753
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,830
optimizer, for the shampoo optimizer,
and for what I'm going to talk about in

754
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
and for what I'm going to talk about in
 

755
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,029
and for what I'm going to talk about in
terms of MUP are not just little like we

756
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
terms of MUP are not just little like we
 

757
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,470
terms of MUP are not just little like we
wanted to make a homework problem about

758
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,480
wanted to make a homework problem about
 

759
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,149
wanted to make a homework problem about
SVD because we love the SVD, but it

760
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
SVD because we love the SVD, but it
 

761
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,110
SVD because we love the SVD, but it
actually matters. Okay, you should also

762
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
actually matters. Okay, you should also
 

763
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,549
actually matters. Okay, you should also
love the SVD, but that's a separate

764
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
love the SVD, but that's a separate
 

765
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,149
love the SVD, but that's a separate
issue.

766
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159

 

767
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,630

So I just want to make it clear that

768
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,640
So I just want to make it clear that
 

769
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,390
So I just want to make it clear that
there's a reason that we're spending so

770
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:12,400
there's a reason that we're spending so
 

771
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,669
there's a reason that we're spending so
much time on optimization and one of the

772
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
much time on optimization and one of the
 

773
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,950
much time on optimization and one of the
reasons we wanted to bring this is

774
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:16,960
reasons we wanted to bring this is
 

775
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,990
reasons we wanted to bring this is
because this is something that is

776
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
because this is something that is
 

777
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,710
because this is something that is
happening now. We wouldn't have been

778
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,720
happening now. We wouldn't have been
 

779
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,430
happening now. We wouldn't have been
able to maybe yeah this paper was not

780
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
able to maybe yeah this paper was not
 

781
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,430
able to maybe yeah this paper was not
out in the last year's last year's

782
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
out in the last year's last year's
 

783
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,710
out in the last year's last year's
version of this class. Right? So um it's

784
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:28,720
version of this class. Right? So um it's
 

785
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,350
version of this class. Right? So um it's
uh we're really trying to bring you to

786
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:31,360
uh we're really trying to bring you to
 

787
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,350
uh we're really trying to bring you to
this. Okay.

788
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:33,360
this. Okay.
 

789
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,669
this. Okay.
So these optimizers basically they're

790
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
So these optimizers basically they're
 

791
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,470
So these optimizers basically they're
they're great and there's a lot that we

792
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,480
they're great and there's a lot that we
 

793
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,789
they're great and there's a lot that we
can do with them. Muon is still

794
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:40,799
can do with them. Muon is still
 

795
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,310
can do with them. Muon is still
something that's being developed.

796
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,320
something that's being developed.
 

797
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,110
something that's being developed.
Shampoo is uh give me one second I'll

798
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
Shampoo is uh give me one second I'll
 

799
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,390
Shampoo is uh give me one second I'll
get to it. Shampoo

800
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,400
get to it. Shampoo
 

801
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,750
get to it. Shampoo
is also something that's really

802
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:49,760
is also something that's really
 

803
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,950
is also something that's really
interesting but as the point was brought

804
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:50,960
interesting but as the point was brought
 

805
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,950
interesting but as the point was brought
up someone last time really reminded us

806
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
up someone last time really reminded us
 

807
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,110
up someone last time really reminded us
that hey but you know shampoo

808
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
that hey but you know shampoo
 

809
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,270
that hey but you know shampoo
essentially requires you to compute the

810
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,280
essentially requires you to compute the
 

811
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,070
essentially requires you to compute the
SVD and that's really hard to do. So is

812
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,080
SVD and that's really hard to do. So is
 

813
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,270
SVD and that's really hard to do. So is
shampoo even efficient to to implement?

814
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:03,280
shampoo even efficient to to implement?
 

815
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,029
shampoo even efficient to to implement?
So turns out yeah shampoo can be

816
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:05,039
So turns out yeah shampoo can be
 

817
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,470
So turns out yeah shampoo can be
computationally expensive to implement.

818
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
computationally expensive to implement.
 

819
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,990
computationally expensive to implement.
So it's not something that's widely used

820
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
So it's not something that's widely used
 

821
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,549
So it's not something that's widely used
in practice. Muon solves that problem

822
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
in practice. Muon solves that problem
 

823
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,310
in practice. Muon solves that problem
and we will talk about how it's

824
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:12,320
and we will talk about how it's
 

825
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,630
and we will talk about how it's
implemented and how it's different uh

826
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,640
implemented and how it's different uh
 

827
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,190
implemented and how it's different uh
different next time.

828
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,200
different next time.
 

829
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,630
different next time.
But now let's say what we wanted to do

830
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
But now let's say what we wanted to do
 

831
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,990
But now let's say what we wanted to do
was we wanted to think about using the

832
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,000
was we wanted to think about using the
 

833
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,590
was we wanted to think about using the
ideas that we have developed so far but

834
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
ideas that we have developed so far but
 

835
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,750
ideas that we have developed so far but
focusing on something that we already

836
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
focusing on something that we already
 

837
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,510
focusing on something that we already
know how to do well which is sign SGD

838
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
know how to do well which is sign SGD
 

839
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,549
know how to do well which is sign SGD
and atom. Okay. So the next thing that I

840
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
and atom. Okay. So the next thing that I
 

841
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,750
and atom. Okay. So the next thing that I
want to talk about I'm going to pause

842
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:37,760
want to talk about I'm going to pause
 

843
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,190
want to talk about I'm going to pause
the discussion on muon. We're not going

844
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,200
the discussion on muon. We're not going
 

845
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,950
the discussion on muon. We're not going
to talk about it right now. But let's

846
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
to talk about it right now. But let's
 

847
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,990
to talk about it right now. But let's
say we want to bring those ideas to bear

848
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
say we want to bring those ideas to bear
 

849
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,149
say we want to bring those ideas to bear
in terms of thinking about Adam. Before

850
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
in terms of thinking about Adam. Before
 

851
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,590
in terms of thinking about Adam. Before
I go there I know there's a question at

852
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
I go there I know there's a question at
 

853
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,510
I go there I know there's a question at
the back.

854
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
the back.
 

855
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,750

talking about rescaling in terms of the
 

867
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,110
talking about rescaling in terms of the
scaling the parameters right okay so I

868
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,120
scaling the parameters right okay so I
 

869
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,269
scaling the parameters right okay so I
will talk more about this but what I

870
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:09,279
will talk more about this but what I
 

871
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,669
will talk more about this but what I

what I'm thinking of is I'm thinking of
I want to take a small let's say I want

I want to take a small let's say I want
 

877
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,190
I want to take a small let's say I want
to train some giant trillion parameter

878
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,200
to train some giant trillion parameter

understand what the best hyperparameters
 

885

are so what I want to do is I want to
 

887
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,870
are so what I want to do is I want to
take a baby version of that model people

888
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
take a baby version of that model people
 

889
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,669
take a baby version of that model people
sometimes call this a proxy model and I

890
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:31,679
sometimes call this a proxy model and I
 

891
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,310
sometimes call this a proxy model and I
want to do a extensive hyperparameter

892
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,320
want to do a extensive hyperparameter
 

893
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,549
want to do a extensive hyperparameter
search on that baby proxy model

894
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:38,559
search on that baby proxy model
 

895
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,830
search on that baby proxy model
and then I want to oneshot transfer them

896
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:41,840
and then I want to oneshot transfer them
 

897
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,430
and then I want to oneshot transfer them
to the big model. I want to just say I

898
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
to the big model. I want to just say I
 

899
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,990
to the big model. I want to just say I
tune my hyperparameters here cheaply and

900
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,000
tune my hyperparameters here cheaply and
 

901
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,269
tune my hyperparameters here cheaply and
then I just use them there to get the

902
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
then I just use them there to get the
 

903
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,430
then I just use them there to get the
most performance. So I'm not trying to

904
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
most performance. So I'm not trying to
 

905
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,750
most performance. So I'm not trying to
do anything about computation in the in

906
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
do anything about computation in the in
 

907
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,549
do anything about computation in the in

just

right this is

I'm calling it a but I'm really think of

944
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm calling it a but I'm really think of
 

945
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,750
I'm calling it a but I'm really think of
this as the w matrix my weight matrix in

946
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:51,760
this as the w matrix my weight matrix in
 

947
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,470
this as the w matrix my weight matrix in
my neural network. So this is what is

948
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
my neural network. So this is what is
 

949
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,950
my neural network. So this is what is
multiplying my uh input or my

950
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
multiplying my uh input or my
 

951
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,190
multiplying my uh input or my
activations.

proxy model, nothing to do with
 

957
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,430
proxy model, nothing to do with
parameter transfer.

958
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440

 

959
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,990

Other questions?

960
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,000

 

961
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,510

Okay.

962
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,520
Okay.
 

963
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,950
Okay.
Yeah, I will talk about parameter

964
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:16,960
Yeah, I will talk about parameter
 

965
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,510
Yeah, I will talk about parameter
transfer uh soon, but we're just not

966
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
transfer uh soon, but we're just not
 

967
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,110
transfer uh soon, but we're just not
we're not there yet. I was just trying

968
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
we're not there yet. I was just trying
 

969
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,950
we're not there yet. I was just trying
to give you a I'll make it more clear

970
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
to give you a I'll make it more clear
 

971
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,070
to give you a I'll make it more clear
what we're talking about. I just want to

972
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,080
what we're talking about. I just want to
 

973
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,909
what we're talking about. I just want to
give you a big picture of why we're

974
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
give you a big picture of why we're
 

975
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,630
give you a big picture of why we're
doing what we're doing.

976
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:28,640
doing what we're doing.
 

977
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,070
doing what we're doing.
Okay. So, coming back,

978
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:34,080

 

979
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,909

let's take the following perspective. We

980
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:35,919
let's take the following perspective. We
 

981
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,390
let's take the following perspective. We
like Adam. Why? because well everyone

982
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:38,400
like Adam. Why? because well everyone
 

983
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,909
like Adam. Why? because well everyone
likes Adam or because uh there are nice

984
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
likes Adam or because uh there are nice
 

985
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,950
likes Adam or because uh there are nice
implementations in uh Python for this

986
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:44,960
implementations in uh Python for this
 

987
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,710
implementations in uh Python for this
already. We want to understand atom

988
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:48,720
already. We want to understand atom
 

989
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,070
already. We want to understand atom
and in fact we're going to think about

990
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
and in fact we're going to think about
 

991
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,830
and in fact we're going to think about
atom for the purposes of this lecture.

992
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
atom for the purposes of this lecture.
 

993
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,950
atom for the purposes of this lecture.
We're going to think about atom really

994
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:52,960
We're going to think about atom really
 

995
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,950
We're going to think about atom really
as just sin sd right because we want to

996
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
as just sin sd right because we want to
 

997
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,350
as just sin sd right because we want to
think about uh a simp simplified

998
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:57,360
think about uh a simp simplified
 

999
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,350
think about uh a simp simplified
perspective. A lot of these ideas will

1000
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
perspective. A lot of these ideas will
 

1001
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,350
perspective. A lot of these ideas will
extend uh directly to atom.

1002
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,360
extend uh directly to atom.
 

1003
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,789
extend uh directly to atom.
But I want to be intelligent about my

1004
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:06,799
But I want to be intelligent about my
 

1005
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,389
But I want to be intelligent about my
choice of step size when I'm doing sind.

1006
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:10,399
choice of step size when I'm doing sind.
 

1007
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,029
choice of step size when I'm doing sind.
Okay. I don't want to yeah I want to

1008
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,039
Okay. I don't want to yeah I want to
 

1009
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,269
Okay. I don't want to yeah I want to
just bring to bear everything I can in

1010
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
just bring to bear everything I can in
 

1011
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,669
just bring to bear everything I can in
and I want to do better at choosing this

1012
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679
and I want to do better at choosing this
 

1013
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,950
and I want to do better at choosing this
ADA. Okay.

1014
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:20,960
ADA. Okay.
 

1015
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,830
ADA. Okay.
So can I do that by using somehow the

1016
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:25,840
So can I do that by using somehow the
 

1017
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,389
So can I do that by using somehow the
RMS norm or the fact that the RMS norm

1018
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:28,399
RMS norm or the fact that the RMS norm
 

1019
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,269
RMS norm or the fact that the RMS norm
brings in the natural geometry of the

1020
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:31,279
brings in the natural geometry of the
 

1021
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,789
brings in the natural geometry of the
problem into the calculations and the

1022
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
problem into the calculations and the
 

1023
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,430
problem into the calculations and the
optimization that you're doing. Okay, we

1024
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
optimization that you're doing. Okay, we
 

1025
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,149
optimization that you're doing. Okay, we
know that this RMS norm can do that. We

1026
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
know that this RMS norm can do that. We
 

1027
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,230
know that this RMS norm can do that. We
have this atom here and let's say we're

1028
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:42,240
have this atom here and let's say we're
 

1029
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,269
have this atom here and let's say we're
committed to using it. So can we just

1030
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:45,279
committed to using it. So can we just
 

1031
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,669
committed to using it. So can we just
improve the performance of atom is kind

1032
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:47,679
improve the performance of atom is kind
 

1033
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,510
improve the performance of atom is kind
of the perspective we want to take.

1034
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:49,520
of the perspective we want to take.
 

1035
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,990
of the perspective we want to take.
Everyone okay with the thing that we're

1036
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,000
Everyone okay with the thing that we're
 

1037
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,630
Everyone okay with the thing that we're
trying to do? Okay, we don't really know

1038
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:54,640
trying to do? Okay, we don't really know
 

1039
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,710
trying to do? Okay, we don't really know
what we're doing yet,

1040
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:56,720
what we're doing yet,
 

1041
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,950
what we're doing yet,
but we're just saying we like the RMS

1042
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
but we're just saying we like the RMS
 

1043
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,029
but we're just saying we like the RMS
norm, we like Adam. Let's try to bring

1044
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:03,039
norm, we like Adam. Let's try to bring
 

1045
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,029
norm, we like Adam. Let's try to bring
them together to understand if we can

1046
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039
them together to understand if we can
 

1047
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,310
them together to understand if we can
better get a better step size for Adam.

1048
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,320
better get a better step size for Adam.
 

1049
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,549
better get a better step size for Adam.
Okay.

1050
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:10,559
Okay.
 

1051
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,630
Okay.
So let's say we want to do this for Adam

1052
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:14,640
So let's say we want to do this for Adam
 

1053
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,549
So let's say we want to do this for Adam
and we want to have an update for Adam

1054
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:18,559
and we want to have an update for Adam
 

1055
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,470
and we want to have an update for Adam
such that

1056
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
such that
 

1057
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,669
such that
we make sure that the RMS to RMS norm is

1058
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679
we make sure that the RMS to RMS norm is
 

1059
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,190
we make sure that the RMS to RMS norm is
not too large. Okay.

1060
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,200
not too large. Okay.
 

1061
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,630
not too large. Okay.
So this is saying that the parameters

1062
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640
So this is saying that the parameters
 

1063
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,110
So this is saying that the parameters
are changing the parameters on the of

1064
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,120
are changing the parameters on the of
 

1065
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,510
are changing the parameters on the of
the weights.

1066
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:35,520
the weights.
 

1067
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,870
the weights.
This is basically this is what this is

1068
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880
This is basically this is what this is
 

1069
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,750
This is basically this is what this is
talking about. They're talking about

1070
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:37,760
talking about. They're talking about
 

1071
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,830
talking about. They're talking about
this delta w and this delta w remember

1072
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,840
this delta w and this delta w remember
 

1073
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,070
this delta w and this delta w remember
is just wt + 1 minus wt right it's the

1074
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,080
is just wt + 1 minus wt right it's the
 

1075
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,950
is just wt + 1 minus wt right it's the
change in w I haven't it's don't get

1076
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:46,960
change in w I haven't it's don't get
 

1077
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,630
change in w I haven't it's don't get
confused with the gradient and the delta

1078
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:48,640
confused with the gradient and the delta
 

1079
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,029
confused with the gradient and the delta
these are one is upside down of the

1080
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:51,039
these are one is upside down of the
 

1081
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,549
these are one is upside down of the
other

1082
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559

 

1083
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,909

questions here on what we're trying to

1084
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
questions here on what we're trying to
 

1085
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,830
questions here on what we're trying to
do because if this setup is unclear then

1086
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
do because if this setup is unclear then
 

1087
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,190
do because if this setup is unclear then
like the rest is going to be more

1088
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
like the rest is going to be more
 

1089
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,350
like the rest is going to be more
confusing everyone good with this

1090
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,360
confusing everyone good with this
 

1091
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:10,310
confusing everyone good with this
okay Good.

1092
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:10,320

 

1093
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,990

So let's think about what's happening

1094
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
So let's think about what's happening
 

1095
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,070
So let's think about what's happening
with atom or sing really I should say

1096
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,080
with atom or sing really I should say
 

1097
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,070
with atom or sing really I should say
and let's consider a mini batch a tiny

1098
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,080
and let's consider a mini batch a tiny
 

1099
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,190
and let's consider a mini batch a tiny
batch just a batch one update. Okay.

1100
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,200
batch just a batch one update. Okay.
 

1101
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,909
batch just a batch one update. Okay.
So, first thing that I want to observe

1102
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:25,919
So, first thing that I want to observe
 

1103
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,110
So, first thing that I want to observe
is that

1104
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
is that
 

1105
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,950
is that
if I think about the gradient of the

1106
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
if I think about the gradient of the
 

1107
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,549
if I think about the gradient of the
loss with respect to my W,

1108
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:34,559
loss with respect to my W,
 

1109
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,269
loss with respect to my W,
if my batch size is one, then this

1110
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:37,279
if my batch size is one, then this
 

1111
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,590
if my batch size is one, then this
gradient is going to be low rank and

1112
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:39,600
gradient is going to be low rank and
 

1113
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,230
gradient is going to be low rank and
specifically it's going to be only rank

1114
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
specifically it's going to be only rank
 

1115
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,789
specifically it's going to be only rank
one.

1116
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
one.
 

1117
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,909
one.
Okay, why is this true?

1118
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:47,919
Okay, why is this true?
 

1119
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,950
Okay, why is this true?
This is true because for example you

1120
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:50,960
This is true because for example you
 

1121
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,430
This is true because for example you
know that for generalized linear models

1122
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,440
know that for generalized linear models
 

1123
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,630
know that for generalized linear models
in general you're you can only move you

1124
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:56,640
in general you're you can only move you
 

1125
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,950
in general you're you can only move you
can only take steps that are in the span

1126
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
can only take steps that are in the span
 

1127
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,630
can only take steps that are in the span
of the data right your gradient will

1128
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:02,640
of the data right your gradient will
 

1129
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,549
of the data right your gradient will
always take steps you're basically what

1130
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:04,559
always take steps you're basically what
 

1131
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,669
always take steps you're basically what
your the step that you're going to take

1132
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:05,679
your the step that you're going to take
 

1133
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,310
your the step that you're going to take
is going to be how how wrong are you

1134
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
is going to be how how wrong are you
 

1135
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,110
is going to be how how wrong are you
times your data

1136
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,120
times your data
 

1137
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,549
times your data
does everyone remember this

1138
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559
does everyone remember this
 

1139
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,630
does everyone remember this
okay

1140
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:16,640
okay
 

1141
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,630
okay
so if If I only have one data point then

1142
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
so if If I only have one data point then
 

1143
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,149
so if If I only have one data point then
what I I have to move in the span of

1144
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:22,159
what I I have to move in the span of
 

1145
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,669
what I I have to move in the span of
that data point. So what is the

1146
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:23,679
that data point. So what is the
 

1147
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,669
that data point. So what is the
dimensionality of the step that I can

1148
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:25,679
dimensionality of the step that I can
 

1149
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,669
dimensionality of the step that I can
take? Well, I can only take a step in

1150
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:27,679
take? Well, I can only take a step in
 

1151
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,029
take? Well, I can only take a step in
that one direction in that one

1152
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
that one direction in that one
 

1153
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,350
that one direction in that one
dimension. Right? So the rank of this

1154
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,360
dimension. Right? So the rank of this
 

1155
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,110
dimension. Right? So the rank of this
gradient had better be one.

1156
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,120

 

1157
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,269

One thing that we can do if we have time

1158
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
One thing that we can do if we have time
 

1159
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,509
One thing that we can do if we have time
um I don't know that we will but if we

1160
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:41,519
um I don't know that we will but if we
 

1161
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,269
um I don't know that we will but if we
don't have time to do it in lecture you

1162
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:43,279
don't have time to do it in lecture you
 

1163
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,870
don't have time to do it in lecture you
definitely should is you should

1164
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:44,880
definitely should is you should
 

1165
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,789
definitely should is you should
calculate this out to make sure that you

1166
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
calculate this out to make sure that you
 

1167
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,070
calculate this out to make sure that you
can convince yourself that this is

1168
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
can convince yourself that this is
 

1169
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,230
can convince yourself that this is
actually rank one. Okay,

1170
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:54,240

 

1171
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,990

good.

1172
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,000

 

1173
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,750

So if this gradient is low rank and

1174
00:31:59,750 --> 00:31:59,760
So if this gradient is low rank and
 

1175
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,509
So if this gradient is low rank and
let's say it's rank one, that means that

1176
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
let's say it's rank one, that means that
 

1177
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,789
let's say it's rank one, that means that
I can write it out in this outer product

1178
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:06,799
I can write it out in this outer product
 

1179
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,870
I can write it out in this outer product
form which is the singular value times a

1180
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:10,880
form which is the singular value times a
 

1181
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,669
form which is the singular value times a
U times a VRPOSE. Right? If it's a rank

1182
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:13,679
U times a VRPOSE. Right? If it's a rank
 

1183
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,389
U times a VRPOSE. Right? If it's a rank
one, this is what it spd looks like.

1184
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:16,399
one, this is what it spd looks like.
 

1185
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,909
one, this is what it spd looks like.
Everyone good? Okay, good.

1186
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:19,919
Everyone good? Okay, good.
 

1187
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,190
Everyone good? Okay, good.
So okay.

1188
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,200
So okay.
 

1189
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,870
So okay.
So what is the spectral norm of this?

1190
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:24,880
So what is the spectral norm of this?
 

1191
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,230
So what is the spectral norm of this?
What is the forbinous norm of this? Why

1192
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,240
What is the forbinous norm of this? Why
 

1193
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,310
What is the forbinous norm of this? Why
don't you take a minute and try to try

1194
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,320
don't you take a minute and try to try
 

1195
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,389
don't you take a minute and try to try
to do that and maybe just talk to each

1196
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:30,399
to do that and maybe just talk to each
 

1197
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,830
to do that and maybe just talk to each
other to make sure that you're like

1198
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:31,840
other to make sure that you're like
 

1199
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,509
other to make sure that you're like
everyone is okay with the setup that

1200
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:33,519
everyone is okay with the setup that
 

1201
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,630
everyone is okay with the setup that
we're doing because we're making some

1202
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
we're doing because we're making some
 

1203
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,990
we're doing because we're making some
jumps. So this is a good time to talk to

1204
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,000
jumps. So this is a good time to talk to
 

1205
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,070
jumps. So this is a good time to talk to
your neighbor and get some get your

1206
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,080
your neighbor and get some get your
 

1207
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,350
your neighbor and get some get your
questions resolved. If you can't resolve

1208
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,360
questions resolved. If you can't resolve
 

1209
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,710
questions resolved. If you can't resolve
them together, ask me. So on and so

1210
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
them together, ask me. So on and so
 

1211
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,310
them together, ask me. So on and so
forth. I'm gonna set a timer for you to

1212
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320
forth. I'm gonna set a timer for you to
 

1213
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,230
forth. I'm gonna set a timer for you to
just talk about these norms and

1214
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,240
just talk about these norms and
 

1215
00:32:48,240 --> 00:33:24,710
just talk about these norms and
um think

1216
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:24,720

 

1217
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,549

after

1218
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559

 

1219
00:33:28,559 --> 00:34:35,030

They just

1220
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,040

 

1221
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:55,490

appropriate.

1222
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:55,500

 

1223
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,790

[Music]

1224
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,800
[Music]
 

1225
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,750
[Music]
Okay, so that's my timer

1226
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:01,760
Okay, so that's my timer
 

1227
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,910
Okay, so that's my timer
first. Anyone have any questions? We're

1228
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:03,920
first. Anyone have any questions? We're
 

1229
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,589
first. Anyone have any questions? We're
good. Your neighbors understand what's

1230
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:05,599
good. Your neighbors understand what's
 

1231
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,950
good. Your neighbors understand what's
going what? Your neighbors understand

1232
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:06,960
going what? Your neighbors understand
 

1233
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,069
going what? Your neighbors understand
what's going on and you understand

1234
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
what's going on and you understand
 

1235
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,310
what's going on and you understand
what's going on.

1236
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
what's going on.
 

1237
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,510
what's going on.
>> Yeah. Okay. Good. So then what's the

1238
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:13,520
>> Yeah. Okay. Good. So then what's the
 

1239
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:20,710
>> Yeah. Okay. Good. So then what's the
spectral norm of this matrix?

1240
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:20,720

 

1241
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,990

>> Sigma, right?

1242
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,000
>> Sigma, right?
 

1243
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,190
>> Sigma, right?
>> Okay. Great. Easy. Excellent. So I can

1244
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
>> Okay. Great. Easy. Excellent. So I can
 

1245
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,150
>> Okay. Great. Easy. Excellent. So I can
just write that here. The spectral norm

1246
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,160
just write that here. The spectral norm
 

1247
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,069
just write that here. The spectral norm
of this

1248
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:34,079

 

1249
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,150

is just sigma. And what about the

1250
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,160
is just sigma. And what about the
 

1251
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,150
is just sigma. And what about the
frobinius norm?

1252
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,160

 

1253
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,710

>> Okay, the frobinous norm is also sigma.

1254
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:44,720
>> Okay, the frobinous norm is also sigma.
 

1255
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,990
>> Okay, the frobinous norm is also sigma.
Why is the probinius norm also sigma?

1256
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,000
Why is the probinius norm also sigma?
 

1257
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,150
Why is the probinius norm also sigma?
>> Yeah.

1258
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,160
>> Yeah.
 

1259
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,589
>> Yeah.
>> UV or orthonormal. So

1260
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:55,599

 

1261
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,030

>> okay, so there's many different ways to

1262
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,040
>> okay, so there's many different ways to
 

1263
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,150
>> okay, so there's many different ways to
see it. Um the way I like to see it is

1264
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,160
see it. Um the way I like to see it is
 

1265
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,750
see it. Um the way I like to see it is
that the provinius norm squared is just

1266
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:01,760
that the provinius norm squared is just
 

1267
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,030
that the provinius norm squared is just
the sum of the squares of the singular

1268
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,040
the sum of the squares of the singular
 

1269
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,510
the sum of the squares of the singular
values is one easy way. You can also

1270
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,520
values is one easy way. You can also
 

1271
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,150
values is one easy way. You can also
just take the trace. Um that's a third

1272
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,160
just take the trace. Um that's a third
 

1273
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,069
just take the trace. Um that's a third
option. But so the forbinous norm is

1274
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:12,079
option. But so the forbinous norm is
 

1275
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,670
option. But so the forbinous norm is
also sigma. Great. Okay.

1276
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:15,680
also sigma. Great. Okay.
 

1277
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,990
also sigma. Great. Okay.
So now we understand this matrix a

1278
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,000
So now we understand this matrix a
 

1279
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,750
So now we understand this matrix a
little bit. Now let's move to the next

1280
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
little bit. Now let's move to the next
 

1281
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,230
little bit. Now let's move to the next
thing. Right? Remember we're trying to

1282
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,240
thing. Right? Remember we're trying to
 

1283
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,589
thing. Right? Remember we're trying to
understand this equation.

1284
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:27,599

 

1285
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,030

and how our W's are evolving and we want

1286
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,040
and how our W's are evolving and we want
 

1287
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,430
and how our W's are evolving and we want
to understand well how are they how is

1288
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,440
to understand well how are they how is
 

1289
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,310
to understand well how are they how is
delta W how is the RMS to RMS induced

1290
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:36,320
delta W how is the RMS to RMS induced
 

1291
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,550
delta W how is the RMS to RMS induced
norm of delta W behaving so to

1292
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:38,560
norm of delta W behaving so to
 

1293
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,750
norm of delta W behaving so to
understand that first we have to

1294
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:39,760
understand that first we have to
 

1295
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,829
understand that first we have to
understand this matrix and then we have

1296
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:41,839
understand this matrix and then we have
 

1297
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,670
understand this matrix and then we have
to understand this matrix this sign

1298
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:43,680
to understand this matrix this sign
 

1299
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,190
to understand this matrix this sign
operation here remember I'm taking as

1300
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,200
operation here remember I'm taking as
 

1301
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,589
operation here remember I'm taking as
element wise so now that I understand

1302
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:49,599
element wise so now that I understand
 

1303
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,109
element wise so now that I understand
this uh gradient of the last matrix

1304
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:53,119
this uh gradient of the last matrix
 

1305
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,790
this uh gradient of the last matrix
let's try to understand this next matrix

1306
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:54,800
let's try to understand this next matrix
 

1307
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,349
let's try to understand this next matrix
which is consider Consider the sign of

1308
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,359
which is consider Consider the sign of
 

1309
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,630
which is consider Consider the sign of
this. Let's call it S. Element wise

1310
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:00,640
this. Let's call it S. Element wise
 

1311
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,030
this. Let's call it S. Element wise
sign.

1312
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,040
sign.
 

1313
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,589
sign.
What is the rank of S? How can we think

1314
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,599
What is the rank of S? How can we think
 

1315
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,829
What is the rank of S? How can we think
about that?

1316
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839

 

1317
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,270

So again, I actually take a minute,

1318
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,280
So again, I actually take a minute,
 

1319
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,270
So again, I actually take a minute,
think about this. This is worth spending

1320
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:13,280
think about this. This is worth spending
 

1321
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:24,870
think about this. This is worth spending
some time on.

1322
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880

 

1323
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,630

Are we still in

1324
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:26,640
Are we still in
 

1325
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,710
Are we still in
>> Are we still in

1326
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:28,720
>> Are we still in
 

1327
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,310
>> Are we still in

1329
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,310
>> We're still in mini batch one.
Everything is the same. All we've done

1330
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:32,320
Everything is the same. All we've done
 

1331
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,390
Everything is the same. All we've done
so we have this matrix here. We know

1332
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:34,400
so we have this matrix here. We know
 

1333
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,670
so we have this matrix here. We know
it's spectral norm. We know it's

1334
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:35,680
it's spectral norm. We know it's
 

1335
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,109
it's spectral norm. We know it's
probinous norm.

00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:39,119
probinous norm.
 

1337
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,069
probinous norm.
What is the rank of S? We don't actually

1338
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:42,079
What is the rank of S? We don't actually
 

1339
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,030
What is the rank of S? We don't actually
need to use this to compute the

1340
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,040
need to use this to compute the
 

1341
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,910
need to use this to compute the
uh rank of S. But first think about what

1342
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920
uh rank of S. But first think about what
 

1343
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,550
uh rank of S. But first think about what
are the entries of S going to be

1344
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,560
are the entries of S going to be
 

1345
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,470
are the entries of S going to be
>> just so that we're all on the same page.

They're going to be plus and minus one,
 

1349
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:21,829
They're going to be plus and minus one,
right? Okay, good. So,

1350
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:21,839

 

1351
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,430

>> okay, I'll give you one more minute. You

1352

seem like you're just starting to think,

1354
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
seem like you're just starting to think,
 

1355
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,069
seem like you're just starting to think,
but okay.

1356
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:26,079
but okay.
 

1357
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:40,790
but okay.

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:53,430

>> Yeah. Question.

1360
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:53,440

 

1361
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,430

Okay, great.

1362
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,440
Okay, great.
 

1363
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,349
Okay, great.
So, um why don't I uh wait till

1364
00:38:59,349 --> 00:38:59,359
So, um why don't I uh wait till
 

1365
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,950
So, um why don't I uh wait till
everyone's done or maybe okay, maybe I

1366
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:00,960
everyone's done or maybe okay, maybe I
 

1367
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,510
everyone's done or maybe okay, maybe I
can answer it. So, here the the question

1368
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,520
can answer it. So, here the the question
 

1369
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,550
can answer it. So, here the the question
that was asked is that wait this delta

1370
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:06,560
that was asked is that wait this delta
 

1371
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,470
that was asked is that wait this delta
WFL gradient is low rank specifically

1372
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:08,480
WFL gradient is low rank specifically
 

1373
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,030
WFL gradient is low rank specifically
rank one. Yes, this is true when you do

1374
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,040
rank one. Yes, this is true when you do
 

1375
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,950
rank one. Yes, this is true when you do
squared loss, but does it hold for other

1376
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:12,960
squared loss, but does it hold for other
 

1377
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,630
squared loss, but does it hold for other
losses too? Is there something special

1378
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:14,640
losses too? Is there something special
 

1379
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,550
losses too? Is there something special
about this loss? The answer is that it

1380
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,560
about this loss? The answer is that it
 

1381
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,510
about this loss? The answer is that it
it holds for uh other losses too. It

1382
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:19,520
it holds for uh other losses too. It
 

1383
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,310
it holds for uh other losses too. It
holds for any kind of generalized

1384
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,320
holds for any kind of generalized
 

1385
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,310
holds for any kind of generalized
uh linear loss. So for example, it would

1386
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:24,320
uh linear loss. So for example, it would
 

1387
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,710
uh linear loss. So for example, it would
hold for u cross entropy loss or

1388
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:28,720
hold for u cross entropy loss or
 

1389
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,670
hold for u cross entropy loss or
many losses that we commonly will will

1390
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:31,680
many losses that we commonly will will
 

1391
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,230
many losses that we commonly will will
be thinking about. Um and the the reason

1392
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,240
be thinking about. Um and the the reason
 

1393
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,349
be thinking about. Um and the the reason
this works is just basically

1394
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:35,359
this works is just basically
 

1395
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,069
this works is just basically
fundamentally the uh the chain rule,

1396
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:38,079
fundamentally the uh the chain rule,
 

1397
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,589
fundamentally the uh the chain rule,
right? So what you want to do to be able

1398
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:39,599
right? So what you want to do to be able
 

1399
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,910
right? So what you want to do to be able
to think about this just to give you a

1400
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:41,920
to think about this just to give you a
 

1401
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,270
to think about this just to give you a
hint of why this is true

1402
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:47,280

 

1403
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,310

is that let's say I have um

1404
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
is that let's say I have um
 

1405
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,710
is that let's say I have um
w * x is equal to h right so I have some

1406
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:56,720
w * x is equal to h right so I have some
 

1407
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,109
w * x is equal to h right so I have some
input this is my weight matrix w this is

1408
00:39:59,109 --> 00:39:59,119
input this is my weight matrix w this is
 

1409
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,470
input this is my weight matrix w this is
my hidden layer h then I want to think

1410
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:02,480
my hidden layer h then I want to think
 

1411
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,630
my hidden layer h then I want to think
about now the um

1412
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:06,640
about now the um
 

1413
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,870
about now the um
derivative of the loss s with respect to

1414
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:10,880
derivative of the loss s with respect to
 

1415
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,710
derivative of the loss s with respect to
W.

1416
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:12,720
W.
 

1417
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,870
W.
And I'm going to think about this as

1418
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:16,880
And I'm going to think about this as
 

1419
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,750
And I'm going to think about this as
the derivative of L with respect to H

1420
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:21,760
the derivative of L with respect to H
 

1421
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,190
the derivative of L with respect to H
of H with respect to

1422
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,200

 

1423
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,030

W. Yeah, I think this is correct. Okay.

1424
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,040
W. Yeah, I think this is correct. Okay.
 

1425
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,710
W. Yeah, I think this is correct. Okay.
So, I'm going to think of this in terms

1426
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:32,720
So, I'm going to think of this in terms
 

1427
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,950
So, I'm going to think of this in terms
of the chain rule. And now what I want

1428
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:34,960
of the chain rule. And now what I want
 

1429
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,430
of the chain rule. And now what I want
you to you can look on your own time if

1430
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:37,440
you to you can look on your own time if
 

1431
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,710
you to you can look on your own time if
you have time later we can do it

1432
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:38,720
you have time later we can do it
 

1433
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,589
you have time later we can do it
together. But

1434
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:41,599
together. But
 

1435
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,670
together. But
this will just turn you can just show.

1436
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
this will just turn you can just show.
 

1437
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,190
this will just turn you can just show.
So how would how would I do this? I can

1438
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,200
So how would how would I do this? I can
 

1439
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,790
So how would how would I do this? I can
now I can I know I can look at this is a

1440
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:48,800
now I can I know I can look at this is a
 

1441
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,550
now I can I know I can look at this is a
linear equation. So I can look at how

1442
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:50,560
linear equation. So I can look at how
 

1443
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,270
linear equation. So I can look at how
every entry of H is influenced by every

1444
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,280
every entry of H is influenced by every
 

1445
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,829
every entry of H is influenced by every
entry of W. Right.

1446
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:55,839
entry of W. Right.
 

1447
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,270
entry of W. Right.
Right. How is H basically I can take

1448
00:40:59,270 --> 00:40:59,280
Right. How is H basically I can take
 

1449
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,630
Right. How is H basically I can take
every row. So w so wigj * xj is equal to

1450
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,640
every row. So w so wigj * xj is equal to
 

1451
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,349
every row. So w so wigj * xj is equal to
hi right the sum over these things right

1452
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:07,359
hi right the sum over these things right
 

1453
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,030
hi right the sum over these things right
just the row times that column gives me

1454
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,040
just the row times that column gives me
 

1455
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,870
just the row times that column gives me
that entry in the just matrix

1456
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
that entry in the just matrix
 

1457
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,349
that entry in the just matrix
multiplication so what you'll see is

1458
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:13,359
multiplication so what you'll see is
 

1459
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,069
multiplication so what you'll see is
that this will just the x vector will

1460
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:16,079
that this will just the x vector will
 

1461
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,349
that this will just the x vector will
just pop up so a calculation worth doing

1462
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:19,359
just pop up so a calculation worth doing
 

1463
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,390
just pop up so a calculation worth doing
on your own time

1464
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:22,400
on your own time
 

1465
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,390
on your own time
but it's it's just just the chain rule

1466
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
but it's it's just just the chain rule
 

1467
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,150
but it's it's just just the chain rule
and linear algebra matrix vector

1468
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,160
and linear algebra matrix vector
 

1469
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,630
and linear algebra matrix vector
multiplications

1470
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:28,640
multiplications
 

1471
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,349
multiplications
>> yes

1472
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:35,359

 

1473
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,510

Excellent. Okay. So why are we talking

1474
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:37,520
Excellent. Okay. So why are we talking
 

1475
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,750
Excellent. Okay. So why are we talking
about the probinius norm suddenly? I

1476
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:39,760
about the probinius norm suddenly? I
 

1477
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,270
about the probinius norm suddenly? I
asked you to calculate the frobinous

1478
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,280
asked you to calculate the frobinous
 

1479
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,190
asked you to calculate the frobinous
norm here because we do not actually use

1480
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,200
norm here because we do not actually use
 

1481
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,710
norm here because we do not actually use
this but in two minutes I'm going to ask

1482
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:46,720
this but in two minutes I'm going to ask
 

1483
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,230
this but in two minutes I'm going to ask
you to make a similar calculation and

1484
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,240
you to make a similar calculation and
 

1485
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,349
you to make a similar calculation and
this will be helpful for you.

1486
00:41:51,349 --> 00:41:51,359
this will be helpful for you.
 

1487
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,390
this will be helpful for you.
So this is just trying to get your cache

1488
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:54,400
So this is just trying to get your cache
 

1489
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,190
So this is just trying to get your cache
uh populated appropriately.

1490
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,200
uh populated appropriately.
 

1491
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,230
uh populated appropriately.
uh we are not really thinking about the

1492
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,240
uh we are not really thinking about the
 

1493
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,710
uh we are not really thinking about the
frobinous norm of this matrix right now

1494
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:02,720
frobinous norm of this matrix right now
 

1495
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,190
frobinous norm of this matrix right now
in any sense. There are other optimizers

1496
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,200
in any sense. There are other optimizers
 

1497
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,030
in any sense. There are other optimizers
that have been designed through thinking

1498
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:07,040
that have been designed through thinking
 

1499
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,510
that have been designed through thinking
about the frobinius norm. We're not

1500
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:09,520
about the frobinius norm. We're not
 

1501
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,150
about the frobinius norm. We're not
going there right now. Yes. Uh

1502
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,160
going there right now. Yes. Uh
 

1503
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,109
going there right now. Yes. Uh
other questions. Okay. So back to

1504
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:17,119
other questions. Okay. So back to
 

1505
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,230
other questions. Okay. So back to
thinking about the rank of X. Okay. So

1506
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:20,240
thinking about the rank of X. Okay. So
 

1507
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,829
thinking about the rank of X. Okay. So
how do we think about calculating this

1508
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:21,839
how do we think about calculating this
 

1509
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,550
how do we think about calculating this
rank of S? Well,

1510
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:24,560
rank of S? Well,
 

1511
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,270
rank of S? Well,
what do I know about S? I know s is

1512
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:27,280
what do I know about S? I know s is
 

1513
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,510
what do I know about S? I know s is
basically the sign

1514
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,520
basically the sign
 

1515
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,190
basically the sign
of sigma u vranspose right

1516
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
of sigma u vranspose right
 

1517
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,349
of sigma u vranspose right
okay well sigma is a singular value it's

1518
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:37,359
okay well sigma is a singular value it's
 

1519
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,829
okay well sigma is a singular value it's
always positive uh so I don't need to

1520
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839
always positive uh so I don't need to
 

1521
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,030
always positive uh so I don't need to
worry about that guy so I have this is

1522
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,040
worry about that guy so I have this is
 

1523
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,470
worry about that guy so I have this is
basically the sign of

1524
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:46,480
basically the sign of
 

1525
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,550
basically the sign of
u vranspose

1526
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:48,560
u vranspose
 

1527
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,390
u vranspose
okay

1528
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:50,400
okay
 

1529
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,990
okay
so what is one nice thing about sign

1530
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,000

 

1531
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,710

if I have the sign of

1532
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:58,720
if I have the sign of
 

1533
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:05,349
if I have the sign of
let's say two numbers ui * vj

1534
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:05,359
let's say two numbers ui * vj
 

1535
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,710
let's say two numbers ui * vj
can I write this in terms of the

1536
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:06,720
can I write this in terms of the
 

1537
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,670
can I write this in terms of the
individual signs

1538
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:09,680
individual signs
 

1539
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:16,470
individual signs
is this sine of ui time s of vj right

1540
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:16,480
is this sine of ui time s of vj right
 

1541
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,069
is this sine of ui time s of vj right
positive time positive is positive

1542
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:18,079
positive time positive is positive
 

1543
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,589
positive time positive is positive
negative time positive is negative like

1544
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:19,599
negative time positive is negative like
 

1545
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,430
negative time positive is negative like
it all kind of works out Okay.

1546
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:23,440
it all kind of works out Okay.
 

1547
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,190
it all kind of works out Okay.
So can I write S in terms of

1548
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:27,200
So can I write S in terms of
 

1549
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,910
So can I write S in terms of
the signs of these individual vectors

1550
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:29,920
the signs of these individual vectors
 

1551
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,150
the signs of these individual vectors
themselves?

1552
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,160
themselves?
 

1553
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,990
themselves?
Right? Because this is just an outer

1554
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,000
Right? Because this is just an outer
 

1555
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,069
Right? Because this is just an outer
product, right? So every entry of S is

1556
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:36,079
product, right? So every entry of S is
 

1557
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,309
product, right? So every entry of S is
just a product of two scalers. It's

1558
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:38,319
just a product of two scalers. It's
 

1559
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,150
just a product of two scalers. It's
really convenient. There's no uh

1560
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,160
really convenient. There's no uh
 

1561
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,349
really convenient. There's no uh
so this is equal to the s of u

1562
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:47,359
so this is equal to the s of u
 

1563
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,390
so this is equal to the s of u
times the sign

1564
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
times the sign
 

1565
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,910
times the sign
of vranspose

1566
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:53,920
of vranspose
 

1567
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,829
of vranspose
but now what is this when I have a

1568
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:55,839
but now what is this when I have a
 

1569
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,829
but now what is this when I have a
matrix that can be written like this

1570
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:57,839
matrix that can be written like this
 

1571
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,190
matrix that can be written like this
what is the rank of s given this rank it

1572
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,200
what is the rank of s given this rank it
 

1573
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,710
what is the rank of s given this rank it
has to be a rank one matrix right

1574
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:02,720
has to be a rank one matrix right
 

1575
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,430
has to be a rank one matrix right
because I've written it as a diad

1576
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:05,440
because I've written it as a diad
 

1577
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,589
because I've written it as a diad
okay so this means that the rank of

1578
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:11,599

 

1579
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,670

must be one. Okay, everyone with me?

1580
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:17,680
must be one. Okay, everyone with me?
 

1581
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,190
must be one. Okay, everyone with me?
Good.

1582
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,200
Good.
 

1583
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,710
Good.
Okay,

1584
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:24,720

 

1585
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,630

so let's come back to this. So now I

1586
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:26,640
so let's come back to this. So now I
 

1587
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,030
so let's come back to this. So now I
have my WT + 1 is WT minus ADA * S. This

1588
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,040
have my WT + 1 is WT minus ADA * S. This
 

1589
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,030
have my WT + 1 is WT minus ADA * S. This
is my delta W. And we want this delta W

1590
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,040
is my delta W. And we want this delta W
 

1591
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,630
is my delta W. And we want this delta W
to have a small induced RMS to RMS norm.

1592
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:40,640
to have a small induced RMS to RMS norm.
 

1593
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,550
to have a small induced RMS to RMS norm.
So if we just work this out,

1594
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:46,560

 

1595
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,829

this means that I want ADA time the RMS

1596
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:49,839
this means that I want ADA time the RMS
 

1597
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,150
this means that I want ADA time the RMS
to RMS norm of S to be smaller than

1598
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:52,160
to RMS norm of S to be smaller than
 

1599
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,750
to RMS norm of S to be smaller than
gamma.

1600
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:53,760
gamma.
 

1601
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,990
gamma.
Which means that I have ADA time D in

1602
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:56,000
Which means that I have ADA time D in
 

1603
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,069
Which means that I have ADA time D in
over D out square root time the spectral

1604
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:58,079
over D out square root time the spectral
 

1605
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,990
over D out square root time the spectral
norm of S to be less than gamma. Right?

1606
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,000
norm of S to be less than gamma. Right?
 

1607
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,470
norm of S to be less than gamma. Right?
I'm just plugging in my definition of

1608
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:02,480
I'm just plugging in my definition of
 

1609
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,270
I'm just plugging in my definition of
the RMS to RMS norm.

1610
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
the RMS to RMS norm.
 

1611
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,550
the RMS to RMS norm.
Just algebra is has been done here using

1612
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:08,560
Just algebra is has been done here using
 

1613
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,270
Just algebra is has been done here using
the definition of RMS to RMS norm.

1614
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:13,280

 

1615
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,510

So if I want to make sure that this

1616
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:15,520
So if I want to make sure that this
 

1617
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,589
So if I want to make sure that this
thing is small,

1618
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:17,599
thing is small,
 

1619
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,589
thing is small,
the thing that I have to understand and

1620
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:19,599
the thing that I have to understand and
 

1621
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,550
the thing that I have to understand and
bound is now the spectral norm of this

1622
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
bound is now the spectral norm of this
 

1623
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,190
bound is now the spectral norm of this
matrix S.

1624
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,200
matrix S.
 

1625
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,150
matrix S.
Right? Okay.

1626
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:28,160
Right? Okay.
 

1627
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,550
Right? Okay.
So figure out the spectral norm of this

1628
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:30,560
So figure out the spectral norm of this
 

1629
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:40,390
So figure out the spectral norm of this
matrix S. What can we say about it?

1630
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:40,400

 

1631
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,390

Do it together. Do it together. Always

1632
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:42,400
Do it together. Do it together. Always
 

1633
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:53,829
Do it together. Do it together. Always
more fun.

1634
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:53,839

 

1635
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,109

And since there was this question about

1636
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:55,119
And since there was this question about
 

1637
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,750
And since there was this question about
the Frobinius norm,

1638
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,760
the Frobinius norm,
 

1639
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,190
the Frobinius norm,
And there was a reason that we pulled it

1640
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,200
And there was a reason that we pulled it
 

1641
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,589
And there was a reason that we pulled it
up. So maybe you want to think about the

1642
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:01,599
up. So maybe you want to think about the
 

1643
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,030
up. So maybe you want to think about the
provenius norm while you're figuring out

1644
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040
provenius norm while you're figuring out
 

1645
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:32,150
provenius norm while you're figuring out
the spectral norm.

1646
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,160

 

1647
00:46:32,160 --> 00:47:04,950

You're not

1648
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960

 

1649
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:51,910

Yeah, I think

1650
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:51,920

 

1651
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,470

Okay. So,

1652
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:54,480
Okay. So,
 

1653
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,750
Okay. So,
how are we feeling about the spectral

1654
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:55,760
how are we feeling about the spectral
 

1655
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,230
how are we feeling about the spectral
norm of this?

1656
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:58,240
norm of this?
 

1657
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,750
norm of this?
So, what is the easier thing to

1658
00:47:59,750 --> 00:47:59,760
So, what is the easier thing to
 

1659
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,190
So, what is the easier thing to
calculate for this? the spectral norm or

1660
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:01,200
calculate for this? the spectral norm or
 

1661
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,910
calculate for this? the spectral norm or
the frobinius norm.

1662
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:03,920
the frobinius norm.
 

1663
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,510
the frobinius norm.
>> The frobinous norm is much easier to

1664
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:05,520
>> The frobinous norm is much easier to
 

1665
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,670
>> The frobinous norm is much easier to
calculate for S, right? Because all the

1666
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
calculate for S, right? Because all the
 

1667
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,750
calculate for S, right? Because all the
entries are just plus and minus one. So

1668
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:09,760
entries are just plus and minus one. So
 

1669
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,349
entries are just plus and minus one. So
what is the Frobinius norm? Just the sum

1670
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:13,359
what is the Frobinius norm? Just the sum
 

1671
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,430
what is the Frobinius norm? Just the sum
of the squares of the entries, right? So

1672
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:15,440
of the squares of the entries, right? So
 

1673
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,950
of the squares of the entries, right? So
what is the FBI norm for this thing?

1674
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:20,960

 

1675
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,150

It's just the product of these guys.

1676
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:24,160
It's just the product of these guys.
 

1677
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,790
It's just the product of these guys.
But what do we know? It's just a rank

1678
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:26,800
But what do we know? It's just a rank
 

1679
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,190
But what do we know? It's just a rank
one matrix. So you actually have the

1680
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,200
one matrix. So you actually have the
 

1681
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,870
one matrix. So you actually have the
spectral norm is equal to the probinius

1682
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:30,880
spectral norm is equal to the probinius
 

1683
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,790
spectral norm is equal to the probinius
norm in this case.

1684
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:34,800

 

1685
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,349

Right?

1686
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:39,359

 

1687
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,910

So here I can easily write therefore

1688
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:41,920
So here I can easily write therefore
 

1689
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,390
So here I can easily write therefore
that the spectral norm is just the

1690
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:44,400
that the spectral norm is just the
 

1691
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,510
that the spectral norm is just the
square root of uh d in times dout.

1692
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:49,520
square root of uh d in times dout.
 

1693
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,589
square root of uh d in times dout.
>> Everyone with me?

1694
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:51,599
>> Everyone with me?
 

1695
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,790
>> Everyone with me?
Yes. Questions?

1696
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:54,800
Yes. Questions?
 

1697
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,470
Yes. Questions?
Okay. So, but we wanted this for a

1698
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,480
Okay. So, but we wanted this for a
 

1699
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,589
Okay. So, but we wanted this for a
reason.

1700
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:01,599

 

1701
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,790

I want to now plug this back in

1702
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:04,800
I want to now plug this back in
 

1703
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,710
I want to now plug this back in
to this here. And what do I get? I get

1704
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:08,720
to this here. And what do I get? I get
 

1705
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,589
to this here. And what do I get? I get
basically something that tells me how to

1706
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:11,599
basically something that tells me how to
 

1707
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,230
basically something that tells me how to
scale my step size for sin SGD. Right?

1708
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:16,240
scale my step size for sin SGD. Right?
 

1709
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,549
scale my step size for sin SGD. Right?
Ada was my step size for sin SGD that I

1710
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:18,559
Ada was my step size for sin SGD that I
 

1711
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,750
Ada was my step size for sin SGD that I
started out with. Everyone remember

1712
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:19,760
started out with. Everyone remember
 

1713
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,790
started out with. Everyone remember
that? And now what happens is that these

1714
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:22,800
that? And now what happens is that these
 

1715
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,349
that? And now what happens is that these
douts cancel

1716
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:25,359
douts cancel
 

1717
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,109
douts cancel
and I get square root dn time square

1718
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:27,119
and I get square root dn time square
 

1719

this that's just always true and though
the spectral norm is always this the

1744
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:00,400
the spectral norm is always this the
 

1745
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,630
the spectral norm is always this the
forbidden norm is always the sum of the

1746
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:02,640
forbidden norm is always the sum of the
 

1747
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,950
forbidden norm is always the sum of the
singular values squared or it is always

1748
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:04,960
singular values squared or it is always
 

1749
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,750

questions
yes

1768
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,200
yes
 

1769
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,470
yes
>> elaborate

1770
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:38,480

 

1771
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,950

>> okay yes great great okay okay

1772
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:42,960
>> okay yes great great okay okay
 

1773
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,910
>> okay yes great great okay okay
so let's think of what s is okay. So S

1774
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:47,920
so let's think of what s is okay. So S
 

1775
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,990
so let's think of what s is okay. So S
is looking at this matrix. So let's just

1776
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,000
is looking at this matrix. So let's just
 

1777
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,430
is looking at this matrix. So let's just
do an example.

1778
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:57,440

 

1779
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,150

Okay. Consider the matrix A which is

1780
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:00,160
Okay. Consider the matrix A which is
 

1781
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,790
Okay. Consider the matrix A which is
equal to + 2 -1

1782
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:04,800
equal to + 2 -1
 

1783
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:12,309
equal to + 2 -1
-3 and + one. Okay. So the sign

1784
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:12,319
-3 and + one. Okay. So the sign
 

1785
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,710
-3 and + one. Okay. So the sign
sine of a is equal to

1786
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:16,720
sine of a is equal to
 

1787
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,870
sine of a is equal to
1 - one - one 1

1788
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:20,880
1 - one - one 1
 

1789
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:27,750
1 - one - one 1
okay so the probinius norm now of this

1790
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:27,760
okay so the probinius norm now of this
 

1791
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,430
okay so the probinius norm now of this
uh let me call this uh p

1792
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:31,440
uh let me call this uh p
 

1793
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,670
uh let me call this uh p
the probinius norm of p is equal to the

1794
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:35,680
the probinius norm of p is equal to the
 

1795
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,270
the probinius norm of p is equal to the
sum of the squares the probinous norm

1796
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:37,280
sum of the squares the probinous norm
 

1797
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,309
sum of the squares the probinous norm
there's many different ways to think

1798
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:38,319
there's many different ways to think
 

1799
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:39,990
there's many different ways to think
about it One way of thinking about the

1800
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:40,000
about it One way of thinking about the
 

1801
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,390
about it One way of thinking about the
Frobinius norm is just to say, well,

1802
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:42,400
Frobinius norm is just to say, well,
 

1803
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,470
Frobinius norm is just to say, well,
treat your matrix like a vector. Take

1804
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:44,480
treat your matrix like a vector. Take
 

1805
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,910
treat your matrix like a vector. Take
the sum of the squares of all of the

1806
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:45,920
the sum of the squares of all of the
 

1807
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,069
the sum of the squares of all of the
entries of the vector. So if I take the

1808
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:48,079
entries of the vector. So if I take the
 

1809
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,510
entries of the vector. So if I take the
sum of the squares of all of the entries

1810
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:49,520
sum of the squares of all of the entries
 

1811
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,750
sum of the squares of all of the entries
of this vector, I get 4 * or maybe the

1812
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:53,760
of this vector, I get 4 * or maybe the
 

1813
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,430
of this vector, I get 4 * or maybe the
better way to say is 2 * 2 * 1, right?

1814
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:57,440
better way to say is 2 * 2 * 1, right?
 

1815
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,950
better way to say is 2 * 2 * 1, right?
Because the sum the square of every

1816
00:51:58,950 --> 00:51:58,960
Because the sum the square of every
 

1817
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,510
Because the sum the square of every
entry is 1, right? - 1^2 is equal to 1^2

1818
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:03,520
entry is 1, right? - 1^2 is equal to 1^2
 

1819
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,829
entry is 1, right? - 1^2 is equal to 1^2
is equal to 1.

1820
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:05,839
is equal to 1.
 

1821
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:08,870
is equal to 1.
This is two dimensions. This is two

1822
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:08,880
This is two dimensions. This is two
 

1823
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,109
This is two dimensions. This is two
dimensions and so I have four entries in

1824
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:11,119
dimensions and so I have four entries in
 

1825
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,910
dimensions and so I have four entries in
the matrix each of them give account for

1826
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:13,920
the matrix each of them give account for
 

1827
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,030
the matrix each of them give account for
one in my norm and so my frobinius norm

1828
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,040
one in my norm and so my frobinius norm
 

1829
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,870
one in my norm and so my frobinius norm
squared is equal to four here.

1830
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:22,880

 

1831
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,710

So now when I'm looking at my s I know

1832
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:26,720
So now when I'm looking at my s I know
 

1833
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:35,190
So now when I'm looking at my s I know
that the entries of s

1834
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,200

 

1835
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,870

plus or minus one. Okay, so I'm relying

1836
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:38,880
plus or minus one. Okay, so I'm relying
 

1837
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,549
plus or minus one. Okay, so I'm relying
on what are the properties that I'm

1838
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:40,559
on what are the properties that I'm
 

1839
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,309
on what are the properties that I'm
relying on? I'm relying on the following

1840
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:42,319
relying on? I'm relying on the following
 

1841
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,870
relying on? I'm relying on the following
properties of the forbidius norm and the

1842
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:44,880
properties of the forbidius norm and the
 

1843
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,630
properties of the forbidius norm and the
spectral norm. So the forbinous norm of

1844
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:46,640
spectral norm. So the forbinous norm of
 

1845
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,549
spectral norm. So the forbinous norm of
a matrix

1846
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:48,559
a matrix
 

1847
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:54,309
a matrix
is always equal to the sum over sigma i

1848
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:54,319
is always equal to the sum over sigma i
 

1849
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:59,190
is always equal to the sum over sigma i
squared singular values.

1850
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200

 

1851
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,309

It is equal to the trace

1852
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:02,319
It is equal to the trace
 

1853
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,710
It is equal to the trace
of uh arpose a which is equal to the

1854
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:06,720
of uh arpose a which is equal to the
 

1855
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,190
of uh arpose a which is equal to the
trace of a a transpose

1856
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:11,200
trace of a a transpose
 

1857
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:17,109
trace of a a transpose
and is equal to the sum of a i j squared

1858
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:17,119
and is equal to the sum of a i j squared
 

1859
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,430
and is equal to the sum of a i j squared
over i and j.

1860
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:19,440
over i and j.
 

1861
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,430
over i and j.
Okay, these are all equivalent ways of

1862
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:21,440
Okay, these are all equivalent ways of
 

1863
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:29,589
Okay, these are all equivalent ways of
defining the frobinius norm.

1864
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:29,599

 

1865
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,270

Does this help?

1866
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
Does this help?
 

1867
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:42,069
Does this help?

00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,119
I did not realize that this seemed like
 

1887
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,549
I did not realize that this seemed like
I was making I was doing tricks. I was

1888
00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:06,559
I was making I was doing tricks. I was
 

1889
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,870
I was making I was doing tricks. I was
really not trying to do tricks.

1890

really not trying to do tricks.
So are there do you want do you want me

1892
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:10,800
So are there do you want do you want me
 

1893

1897
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,829

Okay. Good. So then let's come to this.

1898
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:21,839
Okay. Good. So then let's come to this.

00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,280
I want to focus now on
 

1901
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,390
I want to focus now on
uh this thing

1902
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:28,400
uh this thing
 

1903
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,349
uh this thing
and I want to uh interpret it a little

1904
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:31,359
and I want to uh interpret it a little
 

1905
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,710
and I want to uh interpret it a little
bit. Right?

1906
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:34,720

 

1907
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,109

So this is our our standard learning

1908
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:37,119
So this is our our standard learning
 

1909
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,150
So this is our our standard learning
rate for sinus GD. And as was pointed

1910
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:40,160
rate for sinus GD. And as was pointed
 

1911
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,710
rate for sinus GD. And as was pointed
out, what it's saying is that you want

1912
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:42,720
out, what it's saying is that you want
 

1913
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,390
out, what it's saying is that you want
to be scaling this as a function of your

1914
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:46,400
to be scaling this as a function of your
 

1915
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,349
to be scaling this as a function of your
DN. Okay.

1916
00:54:49,349 --> 00:54:49,359
DN. Okay.
 

1917
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,910
DN. Okay.
And or another way of saying is that you

1918
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:51,920
And or another way of saying is that you
 

1919
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,790
And or another way of saying is that you
want to look at this through the lens of

1920
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:54,800
want to look at this through the lens of
 

1921
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:00,150
want to look at this through the lens of
DN. Like DN matters for how your weights

1922
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,160
DN. Like DN matters for how your weights
 

1923
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,630
DN. Like DN matters for how your weights
are going to change for the same step

1924
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:02,640
are going to change for the same step
 

1925
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,710
are going to change for the same step
size like for the same uh ADA.

1926
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:06,720
size like for the same uh ADA.
 

1927
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,190
size like for the same uh ADA.
D in is going to affect how the RMS to

1928
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:11,200
D in is going to affect how the RMS to
 

1929
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,230
D in is going to affect how the RMS to
RMS induced norm of your deltaW is going

1930
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,240
RMS induced norm of your deltaW is going
 

1931
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,670
RMS induced norm of your deltaW is going
to change. That is what this is saying.

1932
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:17,680
to change. That is what this is saying.
 

1933
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,349
to change. That is what this is saying.
Right? This DN is a natural this DN is a

1934
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:21,359
Right? This DN is a natural this DN is a
 

1935
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,750
Right? This DN is a natural this DN is a
natural parameterization.

1936
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:23,760
natural parameterization.
 

1937
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,829
natural parameterization.
It's a natural scaling that is

1938
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:27,839
It's a natural scaling that is
 

1939
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,430
It's a natural scaling that is
emergent in the problem. It's like it's

1940
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:29,440
emergent in the problem. It's like it's
 

1941
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,950
emergent in the problem. It's like it's
there. It's not like I forced it in

1942
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:30,960
there. It's not like I forced it in
 

1943
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,109
there. It's not like I forced it in
there. It came on its own when we

1944
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:33,119
there. It came on its own when we
 

1945
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,750
there. It came on its own when we
started looking at the RMS to RMS norm.

1946
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:37,760
started looking at the RMS to RMS norm.
 

1947
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,950
started looking at the RMS to RMS norm.
Okay. And so

1948
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:40,960
Okay. And so
 

1949
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,630
Okay. And so
what we want to say is that

1950
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:44,640
what we want to say is that
 

1951
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,030
what we want to say is that
looking at this learning rate scaling

1952
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:49,040
looking at this learning rate scaling
 

1953
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,349
looking at this learning rate scaling
with respect to for example the DN of

1954
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:53,359
with respect to for example the DN of
 

1955
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:58,390
with respect to for example the DN of
your uh of of uh the DN for your weight

1956
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:58,400
your uh of of uh the DN for your weight
 

1957
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,589
your uh of of uh the DN for your weight
matrix

1958
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:01,599

 

1959
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,870

might allow you to bound how your

1960
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:04,880
might allow you to bound how your
 

1961
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,230
might allow you to bound how your
updates are changing in an RMS sense.

1962
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:08,240
updates are changing in an RMS sense.
 

1963
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,630
updates are changing in an RMS sense.
Okay.

1964
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
Okay.
 

1965
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,270
Okay.
And so if I think about this, I can

1966
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:13,280
And so if I think about this, I can
 

1967
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,470
And so if I think about this, I can
think about

1968
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:16,480
think about
 

1969
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,390
think about
if I think of this gamma now as my

1970
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:20,400
if I think of this gamma now as my
 

1971
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,150
if I think of this gamma now as my
hyperparameter

1972
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,160
hyperparameter
 

1973
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,750
hyperparameter
and this d as the

1974
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:25,760
and this d as the
 

1975
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,829
and this d as the
natural scaling. This gives me a way in

1976
00:56:29,829 --> 00:56:29,839
natural scaling. This gives me a way in
 

1977
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,829
natural scaling. This gives me a way in
which I can adjust how my

1978
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:31,839
which I can adjust how my
 

1979
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,309
which I can adjust how my
hyperparameters are different on the

1980
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:34,319
hyperparameters are different on the
 

1981
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:38,390
hyperparameters are different on the
layer bylayer basis based on the layer.

1982
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:38,400
layer bylayer basis based on the layer.
 

1983
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,390
layer bylayer basis based on the layer.
Okay,

1984
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:40,400
Okay,
 

1985
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,950
Okay,
does that make sense to everyone? And I

1986
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:42,960
does that make sense to everyone? And I
 

1987
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,150
does that make sense to everyone? And I
can do that without having to have a

1988
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:46,160
can do that without having to have a
 

1989
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,430
can do that without having to have a
explicit different ADA for layer 1,

1990
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,440
explicit different ADA for layer 1,
 

1991
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,750
explicit different ADA for layer 1,
layer two, layer three. I choose one

1992
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:51,760
layer two, layer three. I choose one
 

1993
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,349
layer two, layer three. I choose one
gamma for the entire network. But

1994
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
gamma for the entire network. But
 

1995
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,470
gamma for the entire network. But
because it's getting scaled by this DN,

1996
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:58,480
because it's getting scaled by this DN,
 

1997
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,549
because it's getting scaled by this DN,
I will effectively have different

1998
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:00,559
I will effectively have different
 

1999
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,270
I will effectively have different
learning rates at different layers.

2000
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:05,280
learning rates at different layers.
 

2001
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,349
learning rates at different layers.
Yes.

2002
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:09,359

 

2003
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,190

>> In practice, do we just set a dot to be

2004
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,200
>> In practice, do we just set a dot to be
 

2005
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,109
>> In practice, do we just set a dot to be
equal to or do we set this to be equal

2006
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:13,119
equal to or do we set this to be equal
 

2007
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,630
equal to or do we set this to be equal
to this? Yes. So here I'm looking at

2008
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
to this? Yes. So here I'm looking at
 

2009
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,589
to this? Yes. So here I'm looking at
this as a bound. So great question.

2010
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:17,599
this as a bound. So great question.
 

2011
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,990
this as a bound. So great question.
So here I I I I started out by saying I

2012
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:20,000
So here I I I I started out by saying I
 

2013
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,069
So here I I I I started out by saying I
want this to be small. But what we're

2014
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:22,079
want this to be small. But what we're
 

2015
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:23,750
want this to be small. But what we're
going to see is actually what we will

2016
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:23,760
going to see is actually what we will
 

2017
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,190
going to see is actually what we will
want is we want these delta W's to be

2018
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,200
want is we want these delta W's to be
 

2019
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,030
want is we want these delta W's to be
not too small and not too big. So we're

2020
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:29,040
not too small and not too big. So we're
 

2021
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,309
not too small and not too big. So we're
going to actually want these this to be

2022
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:30,319
going to actually want these this to be
 

2023
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,789
going to actually want these this to be
kind of approximately equal in some kind

2024
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:32,799
kind of approximately equal in some kind
 

2025
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,549
kind of approximately equal in some kind
of order sense. Um but none of our

2026
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:36,559
of order sense. Um but none of our
 

2027
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,030
of order sense. Um but none of our
calculations really depend on this what

2028
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:39,040
calculations really depend on this what
 

2029
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,470
calculations really depend on this what
this is. This could be an approximately

2030
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
this is. This could be an approximately
 

2031
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,230
this is. This could be an approximately
equal and everything will kind of still

2032
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:42,240
equal and everything will kind of still
 

2033
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,270
equal and everything will kind of still
uh follow through.

2034
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,280
uh follow through.
 

2035
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,789
uh follow through.
Okay.

2036
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:46,799
Okay.
 

2037
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:51,829
Okay.
Good questions. So

2038
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:51,839
Good questions. So
 

2039
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,510
Good questions. So
basically what this is saying is that if

2040
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:53,520
basically what this is saying is that if
 

2041
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,349
basically what this is saying is that if
you scale your learning rate inversely

2042
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:55,359
you scale your learning rate inversely
 

2043
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:58,309
you scale your learning rate inversely
with DN then you can always maintain

2044
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:58,319
with DN then you can always maintain
 

2045
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,510
with DN then you can always maintain
this uniform bound on your induced RMS

2046
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:01,520
this uniform bound on your induced RMS
 

2047
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,309
this uniform bound on your induced RMS
to RMS norm. Okay. And remember that the

2048
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:04,319
to RMS norm. Okay. And remember that the
 

2049
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,789
to RMS norm. Okay. And remember that the
induced RMS to RMS norm is helping us

2050
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:06,799
induced RMS to RMS norm is helping us
 

2051
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,390
induced RMS to RMS norm is helping us
maintain

2052
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,400
maintain
 

2053
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,829
maintain
that the features the different hidden

2054
00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:11,839
that the features the different hidden
 

2055
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,630
that the features the different hidden
layers are all approximately the same

2056
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:14,640
layers are all approximately the same
 

2057
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,549
layers are all approximately the same
size. the entries are all approximately

2058
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:16,559
size. the entries are all approximately
 

2059
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,349
size. the entries are all approximately
one. Right? We arrived at that through

2060
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:19,359
one. Right? We arrived at that through
 

2061
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,349
one. Right? We arrived at that through
thinking about the Xavier initialization

2062
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:21,359
thinking about the Xavier initialization
 

2063
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,430
thinking about the Xavier initialization
perspective which says that we want

2064
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:23,440
perspective which says that we want
 

2065
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,950
perspective which says that we want
everything to be approximately of the

2066
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:24,960
everything to be approximately of the
 

2067
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,069
everything to be approximately of the
same order. Does does that is that

2068
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:28,079
same order. Does does that is that
 

2069
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,549
same order. Does does that is that
connection becoming clear? I'm going to

2070
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:30,559
connection becoming clear? I'm going to
 

2071
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,309
connection becoming clear? I'm going to
make it more clear. But do you remember

2072
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:32,319
make it more clear. But do you remember
 

2073
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,309
make it more clear. But do you remember
that?

2074
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:34,319
that?
 

2075
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,390
that?
I see I see question marks on people's

2076
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:36,400
I see I see question marks on people's
 

2077
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:48,230
I see I see question marks on people's
faces. But yes, question at the back.

2078
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:48,240

 

2079
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,430

ah okay great excellent

2080
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:53,440
ah okay great excellent
 

2081
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,349
ah okay great excellent
so here I did all of this and I'm like

2082
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:55,359
so here I did all of this and I'm like
 

2083
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,950
so here I did all of this and I'm like
oh you know great we found this new

2084
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:56,960
oh you know great we found this new
 

2085
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,549
oh you know great we found this new
parameterization we should think about

2086
00:58:58,549 --> 00:58:58,559
parameterization we should think about
 

2087
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,270
parameterization we should think about
dn but I made an assumption here right I

2088
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:01,280
dn but I made an assumption here right I
 

2089
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,829
dn but I made an assumption here right I
made this assumption that uh we're

2090
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:03,839
made this assumption that uh we're
 

2091
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:06,630
made this assumption that uh we're
working with mini batch size one right

2092
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:06,640
working with mini batch size one right
 

2093
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,390
working with mini batch size one right
but in reality you will have bigger mini

2094
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:08,400
but in reality you will have bigger mini
 

2095
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,190
but in reality you will have bigger mini
batches so what happens when you have a

2096
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:11,200
batches so what happens when you have a
 

2097
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,950
batches so what happens when you have a
bigger mini batch or if you have a

2098
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:12,960
bigger mini batch or if you have a
 

2099
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,670
bigger mini batch or if you have a
bigger batch not just mini batch

2100
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:15,680
bigger batch not just mini batch
 

2101
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,589
bigger batch not just mini batch
the thing here that is kind of going to

2102
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:17,599
the thing here that is kind of going to
 

2103
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,230
the thing here that is kind of going to
break is this assumption

2104
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:22,240
break is this assumption
 

2105
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,910
break is this assumption
that your spectral norm and probinous

2106
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:23,920
that your spectral norm and probinous
 

2107
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,910
that your spectral norm and probinous
norm are the same. Now your forbinius

2108
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
norm are the same. Now your forbinius
 

2109
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,069
norm are the same. Now your forbinius
norm will be an upper bound for your uh

2110
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
norm will be an upper bound for your uh
 

2111
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,030
norm will be an upper bound for your uh
spectral norm and so what you will get

2112
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,040
spectral norm and so what you will get
 

2113
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,430
spectral norm and so what you will get
is you will just end up with uh a more

2114
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:35,440
is you will just end up with uh a more
 

2115
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,750
is you will just end up with uh a more
conservative scaling right because

2116
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:37,760
conservative scaling right because
 

2117
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,430
conservative scaling right because
you're replacing if you if you follow

2118
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:39,440
you're replacing if you if you follow
 

2119
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,870
you're replacing if you if you follow
through this calculation well I'm saying

2120
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:40,880
through this calculation well I'm saying
 

2121
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,270
through this calculation well I'm saying
that let me upper bound my spectral norm

2122
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:43,280
that let me upper bound my spectral norm
 

2123
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,390
that let me upper bound my spectral norm
by my probinius norm

2124
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:46,400
by my probinius norm
 

2125
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,549
by my probinius norm
and use that in my calculation and so I

2126
00:59:48,549 --> 00:59:48,559
and use that in my calculation and so I
 

2127
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,950
and use that in my calculation and so I
will just get a more conservative

2128
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:50,960
will just get a more conservative
 

2129
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,670
will just get a more conservative
uh learning rate. Does that make sense?

from Yang and co-authors um I think it
 

2265
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,990
from Yang and co-authors um I think it
was done uh it start it started as work

01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:02,000
was done uh it start it started as work
 

2267
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,190
was done uh it start it started as work
as as part of a Microsoft AI residency

understand how to how to parameter
 

2297
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,670
understand how to how to parameter
parameterize our layers. And after this

2298
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:47,680
parameterize our layers. And after this
 

2299
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,910
parameterize our layers. And after this
paper came out, there's been a series of

2300
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
paper came out, there's been a series of
 

2301
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,829
paper came out, there's been a series of
works. um one of the authors uh so for

2302
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:53,839
works. um one of the authors uh so for
 

2303
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:55,190
works. um one of the authors uh so for
example there's there's a paper that I'm

2304
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:55,200
example there's there's a paper that I'm
 

2305
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,309
example there's there's a paper that I'm
going to talk about by uh Greg Yang the

2306
01:03:58,309 --> 01:03:58,319
going to talk about by uh Greg Yang the
 

2307
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:01,510
going to talk about by uh Greg Yang the
same Greg Yang uh Jeremy Bernstein and

that um

2316
01:04:13,589 --> 01:04:13,599
that um
 

2317
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,950
that um
takes basically a linear algebraic

2318
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:16,960
takes basically a linear algebraic
 

2319
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,029
takes basically a linear algebraic
perspective on the MUP paper and

2320
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:21,039
perspective on the MUP paper and
 

2321
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,270
perspective on the MUP paper and
presents it in a much more simplified

2322
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:23,280
presents it in a much more simplified
 

2323
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,910
presents it in a much more simplified
form. And then what what I've talked to

2324
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:25,920
form. And then what what I've talked to
 

2325
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,670
form. And then what what I've talked to
you is basically us going back and forth

2326
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:27,680
you is basically us going back and forth
 

2327
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,270
you is basically us going back and forth
and trying to further simplify that

2328
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:29,280
and trying to further simplify that
 

2329
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,910
and trying to further simplify that
paper to give a a streamlined uh

2330
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:33,920
paper to give a a streamlined uh
 

2331
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,710
paper to give a a streamlined uh
perspective. So this is a simplified

2332
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:36,720
perspective. So this is a simplified
 

2333
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,589
perspective. So this is a simplified
version of a simplified version uh that

2334
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:39,599
version of a simplified version uh that
 

2335
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,510
version of a simplified version uh that
we're that we're that we're that we're

2336
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:41,520
we're that we're that we're that we're
 

2337
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,910
we're that we're that we're that we're
but it captures the key the key idea.

this but yeah the the muon improves in
 

2351
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,470
this but yeah the the muon improves in
some sense on this because it can uh it

2352
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,480
some sense on this because it can uh it
 

2353
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,109
some sense on this because it can uh it
can close the gap uh on this

2354
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:09,119
can close the gap uh on this
 

2355
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,710
can close the gap uh on this
conservativeness. Exactly. Yeah. Thanks.

Okay. So now what does this
 

2361
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,710
Okay. So now what does this
parameterization what what do we mean by

2362
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:18,720
parameterization what what do we mean by
 

2363
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,470
parameterization what what do we mean by
parameterization? What what am I really

2364
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:20,480
parameterization? What what am I really
 

2365
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,230
parameterization? What what am I really
talking about?

01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,230
me? Everyone's with me? Yeah. Okay,
good.

2376
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:32,240
good.
 

2377
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,390
good.
So this is a table from the Llama 3

2378
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
So this is a table from the Llama 3
 

2379
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,430
So this is a table from the Llama 3
paper sometime in 2020. And what I want

2380
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:37,440
paper sometime in 2020. And what I want
 

2381
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,630
paper sometime in 2020. And what I want
to call your attention to is this column

2382
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:40,640
to call your attention to is this column
 

2383
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:45,109
to call your attention to is this column
D model which is talking about the width

2384
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
D model which is talking about the width
 

2385
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,270
D model which is talking about the width
of the different models that are being

2386
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:47,280
of the different models that are being
 

2387
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,349
of the different models that are being
uh looked at. And

2388
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:51,359
uh looked at. And
 

2389
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,150
uh looked at. And
um

2390
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,160
um
 

2391
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,349
um
here are the different learning rates

2392
01:05:57,349 --> 01:05:57,359
here are the different learning rates
 

2393
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,270
here are the different learning rates
okay

2394
01:05:59,270 --> 01:05:59,280
okay
 

2395
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,630
okay
that are being used and all I want to

2396
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:00,640
that are being used and all I want to
 

2397
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,789
that are being used and all I want to
highlight here is that the learning

2398
01:06:02,789 --> 01:06:02,799
highlight here is that the learning
 

2399
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,390
highlight here is that the learning
rates are different right the model size

2400
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,400
rates are different right the model size
 

2401
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,630
rates are different right the model size
changes and then the learning rate that

2402
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:06,640
changes and then the learning rate that
 

2403
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,029
changes and then the learning rate that
is required to train these model

2404
01:06:09,029 --> 01:06:09,039
is required to train these model
 

2405
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,750
is required to train these model
changes. Okay. So finding the right

2406
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:11,760
changes. Okay. So finding the right
 

2407
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,470
changes. Okay. So finding the right
learning rate matters because if you use

2408
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:14,480
learning rate matters because if you use
 

2409
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,069
learning rate matters because if you use
the wrong learning rate you might not be

2410
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:16,079
the wrong learning rate you might not be
 

2411
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,390
the wrong learning rate you might not be
able to train you might not converge.

2412
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,400
able to train you might not converge.
 

2413
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,549
able to train you might not converge.
Okay, basically what I want to

2414
01:06:20,549 --> 01:06:20,559
Okay, basically what I want to
 

2415
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:24,230
Okay, basically what I want to
communicate here

2416
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:24,240

 

2417
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,670

what Greg Yang and co-authors um I think

2418
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:27,680
what Greg Yang and co-authors um I think
 

2419
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,870
what Greg Yang and co-authors um I think
actually I should I feel there's a

2420
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:28,880
actually I should I feel there's a
 

2421
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,589
actually I should I feel there's a
second author who and therefor equal

2422
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:31,599
second author who and therefor equal
 

2423
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,109
second author who and therefor equal
contributors so I should make sure to I

2424
01:06:33,109 --> 01:06:33,119
contributors so I should make sure to I
 

2425
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,470
contributors so I should make sure to I
shouldn't cite it as just Yang but

2426
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:34,480
shouldn't cite it as just Yang but
 

2427
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,910
shouldn't cite it as just Yang but
there's it's Yang and who and the first

2428
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:35,920
there's it's Yang and who and the first
 

2429
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,750
there's it's Yang and who and the first
two authors are equal contributors.

2430
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:39,760
two authors are equal contributors.
 

2431
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,589
two authors are equal contributors.
Um,

2432
01:06:41,589 --> 01:06:41,599
Um,
 

2433
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,190
Um,
so this is figure one from the MUP paper

2434
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:45,200
so this is figure one from the MUP paper
 

2435
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,870
so this is figure one from the MUP paper
and what they're saying is

2436
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:48,880
and what they're saying is
 

2437
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,150
and what they're saying is
on the x- axis here is the the learning

2438
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:52,160
on the x- axis here is the the learning
 

2439
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:56,309
on the x- axis here is the the learning
rate. The y ais is the training loss.

2440
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:56,319
rate. The y ais is the training loss.
 

2441
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:59,430
rate. The y ais is the training loss.
Okay.

2442
01:06:59,430 --> 01:06:59,440

 

2443
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,750

And they compare their maximal update

2444
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:01,760
And they compare their maximal update
 

2445
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,230
And they compare their maximal update
parameterization to what they call

2446
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,240
parameterization to what they call
 

2447
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,470
parameterization to what they call
standard parameterization which is kind

2448
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:06,480
standard parameterization which is kind
 

2449
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,109
standard parameterization which is kind
of a series of huristics that have come

2450
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:09,119
of a series of huristics that have come
 

2451
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,589
of a series of huristics that have come
together such as Xavier initialization

2452
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:11,599
together such as Xavier initialization
 

2453
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:15,029
together such as Xavier initialization
or her initialization or other rules of

2454
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:15,039
or her initialization or other rules of

01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:19,670
or her initialization or other rules of
thumb of how to uh scale your parameters

2456
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:19,680
thumb of how to uh scale your parameters
 

2457
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:25,589
thumb of how to uh scale your parameters
uh for uh for different models.

2458
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:25,599

 

2459
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,589

What the point the thing to point out

2460
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:27,599
What the point the thing to point out
 

2461
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,670
What the point the thing to point out
here is that as the width of my model

2462
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:31,680
here is that as the width of my model
 

2463
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,589
here is that as the width of my model
increases right each of these different

2464
01:07:33,589 --> 01:07:33,599
increases right each of these different
 

2465
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,470
increases right each of these different
colors is a different width. Black is

2466
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,480
colors is a different width. Black is
 

2467
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,309
colors is a different width. Black is
the widest one. Uh pink is the least

2468
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:40,319
the widest one. Uh pink is the least
 

2469
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,630
the widest one. Uh pink is the least
wide one.

2470
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:42,640
wide one.
 

2471
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,029
wide one.
The optimal learning rate for training

2472
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:45,039
The optimal learning rate for training
 

2473
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,309
The optimal learning rate for training
these shifts and it shifts wildly. It's

2474
01:07:48,309 --> 01:07:48,319
these shifts and it shifts wildly. It's
 

2475
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:49,990
these shifts and it shifts wildly. It's
not a little shift. This is a log scale,

2476
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:50,000
not a little shift. This is a log scale,
 

2477
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,829
not a little shift. This is a log scale,
right? This is changing by orders of

2478
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:51,839
right? This is changing by orders of
 

2479
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:54,630
right? This is changing by orders of
magnitude. Okay, so sometimes you want

2480
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:54,640
magnitude. Okay, so sometimes you want
 

2481
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,870
magnitude. Okay, so sometimes you want
to be taking really big steps, sometimes

2482
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
to be taking really big steps, sometimes
 

2483
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,589
to be taking really big steps, sometimes
you want to be taking much much smaller

2484
01:07:59,589 --> 01:07:59,599
you want to be taking much much smaller
 

2485
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,150
you want to be taking much much smaller
steps. And as you can see, your training

2486
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:02,160
steps. And as you can see, your training
 

2487
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,349
steps. And as you can see, your training
loss will really change based on being

2488
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:05,359
loss will really change based on being
 

2489
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,349
loss will really change based on being
able to find that right hyperparameter.

2490
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:07,359
able to find that right hyperparameter.
 

2491
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:09,029
able to find that right hyperparameter.
Okay,

2492
01:08:09,029 --> 01:08:09,039
Okay,
 

2493
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,390
Okay,
so this idea, this challenge of being

2494
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:12,400
so this idea, this challenge of being
 

2495
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,109
so this idea, this challenge of being
able to

2496
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:15,119
able to
 

2497
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,630
able to
find the right hyperparameter for a

2498
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:16,640
find the right hyperparameter for a
 

2499
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,470
find the right hyperparameter for a
large model without having to do many

2500
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:18,480
large model without having to do many
 

2501
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,189
large model without having to do many
many sweeps of that model to to identify

2502
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:21,199
many sweeps of that model to to identify
 

2503
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:23,030
many sweeps of that model to to identify
this is is a big deal.

2504
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:23,040
this is is a big deal.
 

2505
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,430
this is is a big deal.
versus when you look at the MUP

2506
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:25,440
versus when you look at the MUP
 

2507
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,669
versus when you look at the MUP
perspective. When you parameterize the

2508
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:27,679
perspective. When you parameterize the
 

2509
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,630
perspective. When you parameterize the
model in the right way,

2510
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:30,640
model in the right way,
 

2511
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,870
model in the right way,
what you have is, oh, look at all of

2512
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:32,880
what you have is, oh, look at all of
 

2513
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,550
what you have is, oh, look at all of
these different widths, look at their

2514
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:34,560
these different widths, look at their
 

2515
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,789
these different widths, look at their
training losses,

2516
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:36,799
training losses,
 

2517
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,110
training losses,
and look at where the optimum learning

2518
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:39,120
and look at where the optimum learning
 

2519
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,590
and look at where the optimum learning
rates are, right? They're all basically

2520
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:41,600
rates are, right? They're all basically
 

2521
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,910
rates are, right? They're all basically
in the same spot because you're

2522
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:45,920
in the same spot because you're
 

2523
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,430
in the same spot because you're
since you're looking at the model in the

2524
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:47,440
since you're looking at the model in the
 

2525
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,470
since you're looking at the model in the
in the right way, you're looking at the

2526
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:48,480
in the right way, you're looking at the
 

2527
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,309
in the right way, you're looking at the
parameterization in the right way. Okay?

2528
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:50,319
parameterization in the right way. Okay?
 

2529
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:53,749
parameterization in the right way. Okay?
And so that's what this MUP paper is is

2530
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:53,759
And so that's what this MUP paper is is
 

2531
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,309
And so that's what this MUP paper is is
trying to do. And this is incredible,

2532
01:08:56,309 --> 01:08:56,319
trying to do. And this is incredible,
 

2533
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:57,829
trying to do. And this is incredible,
right? Because that means you can do a

2534
01:08:57,829 --> 01:08:57,839
right? Because that means you can do a
 

2535
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:01,030
right? Because that means you can do a
hyperparameter search on a small model

2536
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:01,040
hyperparameter search on a small model
 

2537
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,430
hyperparameter search on a small model
that is cheap and then just say hey

2538
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:03,440
that is cheap and then just say hey
 

2539
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,030
that is cheap and then just say hey
trillion take this and go right here

2540
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:07,040
trillion take this and go right here
 

2541
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,110
trillion take this and go right here
trillion parameter model just just use

2542
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:09,120
trillion parameter model just just use
 

2543
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,149
trillion parameter model just just use
these zero shot transfer them.

2544
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:12,159
these zero shot transfer them.
 

2545
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:14,470
these zero shot transfer them.
Okay. So this is clearly important.

2546
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:14,480
Okay. So this is clearly important.
 

2547
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:19,749
Okay. So this is clearly important.
That's all I'm trying to say matters.

2548
01:09:19,749 --> 01:09:19,759

 

2549
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:21,829

So what is parameterization really? And

2550
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:21,839
So what is parameterization really? And
 

2551
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:23,749
So what is parameterization really? And
it's in a sense it's about like it's

2552
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:23,759
it's in a sense it's about like it's
 

2553
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,829
it's in a sense it's about like it's
about choosing the right units when you

2554
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:25,839
about choosing the right units when you
 

2555
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:29,590
about choosing the right units when you
think about this from a maybe a physicsy

2556
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:29,600
think about this from a maybe a physicsy
 

2557
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,829
think about this from a maybe a physicsy
perspective. So I already talked about

2558
01:09:31,829 --> 01:09:31,839
perspective. So I already talked about
 

2559
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,829
perspective. So I already talked about
the challenge of hyperparameter search

2560
01:09:33,829 --> 01:09:33,839
the challenge of hyperparameter search
 

2561
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,590
the challenge of hyperparameter search
and it's bad if your network is large

2562
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:35,600
and it's bad if your network is large
 

2563
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,829
and it's bad if your network is large
experiment is expensive. Um and so yeah

2564
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
experiment is expensive. Um and so yeah
 

2565
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:42,070
experiment is expensive. Um and so yeah
can we optimize hyperparameters on

2566
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:42,080
can we optimize hyperparameters on
 

2567
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,749
can we optimize hyperparameters on
smaller networks and then transfer them

2568
01:09:43,749 --> 01:09:43,759
smaller networks and then transfer them
 

2569
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,910
smaller networks and then transfer them
to larger ones? What is the right

2570
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
to larger ones? What is the right
 

2571
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,030
to larger ones? What is the right
scaling? Okay. And so I really like this

2572
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:49,040
scaling? Okay. And so I really like this
 

2573
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,470
scaling? Okay. And so I really like this
example from uh the MUP paper that I

2574
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:52,480
example from uh the MUP paper that I
 

2575
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,709
example from uh the MUP paper that I
want to kind of

2576
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:54,719
want to kind of
 

2577
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,430
want to kind of
illust use to illustrate the importance

2578
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:57,440
illust use to illustrate the importance
 

2579
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,790
illust use to illustrate the importance
of finding the right scaling. Okay. So

2580
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:00,800
of finding the right scaling. Okay. So
 

2581
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,149
of finding the right scaling. Okay. So
let's take an example that everyone

2582
01:10:02,149 --> 01:10:02,159
let's take an example that everyone
 

2583
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:03,910
let's take an example that everyone
knows and is familiar with. Let's say I

2584
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:03,920
knows and is familiar with. Let's say I
 

2585
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,950
knows and is familiar with. Let's say I
have nothing to do with neural networks.

2586
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:06,960
have nothing to do with neural networks.
 

2587
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,030
have nothing to do with neural networks.
Let's say I have some iid samples from a

2588
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:09,040
Let's say I have some iid samples from a
 

2589
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,709
Let's say I have some iid samples from a
zero mean unit variance dist

2590
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:10,719
zero mean unit variance dist
 

2591
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:13,430
zero mean unit variance dist
distribution. Okay. Then I know from the

2592
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:13,440
distribution. Okay. Then I know from the
 

2593
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,070
distribution. Okay. Then I know from the
central limit theorem that basically x1

2594
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:16,080
central limit theorem that basically x1
 

2595
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,390
central limit theorem that basically x1
+ x2 + xn when divided by 1 /<unk> n

2596
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:20,400
+ x2 + xn when divided by 1 /<unk> n
 

2597
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,550
+ x2 + xn when divided by 1 /<unk> n
will converge in distribution to being a

2598
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:22,560
will converge in distribution to being a
 

2599
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,950
will converge in distribution to being a
normal with mean zero variance one.

2600
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:24,960
normal with mean zero variance one.
 

2601
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,390
normal with mean zero variance one.
Okay, we know this.

2602
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:28,400
Okay, we know this.
 

2603
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,790
Okay, we know this.
But if instead I was like I forgot my

2604
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:30,800
But if instead I was like I forgot my
 

2605
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,390
But if instead I was like I forgot my
cheat I wrote the right wrong thing down

2606
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:32,400
cheat I wrote the right wrong thing down
 

2607
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,950
cheat I wrote the right wrong thing down
on my cheat sheet and I forgot to write

2608
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:34,960
on my cheat sheet and I forgot to write
 

2609
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,990
on my cheat sheet and I forgot to write
the square root and I wrote it as 1 / n.

2610
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:38,000
the square root and I wrote it as 1 / n.
 

2611
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,630
the square root and I wrote it as 1 / n.
What happens?

2612
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:40,640
What happens?
 

2613
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,270
What happens?
Does this converge in distribution in an

2614
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:43,280
Does this converge in distribution in an
 

2615
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,030
Does this converge in distribution in an
any interesting way? No. This just

2616
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,040
any interesting way? No. This just
 

2617
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,390
any interesting way? No. This just
becomes zero, right? As n goes to

2618
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:46,400
becomes zero, right? As n goes to
 

2619
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,910
becomes zero, right? As n goes to
infinity

2620
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:47,920
infinity
 

2621
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,430
infinity
or if I chose a different scaling

2622
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,440
or if I chose a different scaling
 

2623
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,110
or if I chose a different scaling
instead of n I just chose a unit

2624
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:51,120
instead of n I just chose a unit
 

2625
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,430
instead of n I just chose a unit
scaling. Well, this just diverges

2626
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:53,440
scaling. Well, this just diverges
 

2627
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,189
scaling. Well, this just diverges
entirely, right? And so there is

2628
01:10:57,189 --> 01:10:57,199
entirely, right? And so there is
 

2629
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,550
entirely, right? And so there is
something interesting about this

2630
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:58,560
something interesting about this
 

2631
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,070
something interesting about this
quantity. Okay? But for us to be able to

2632
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:02,080
quantity. Okay? But for us to be able to
 

2633
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,149
quantity. Okay? But for us to be able to
see it, we have to look at it at the

2634
01:11:04,149 --> 01:11:04,159
see it, we have to look at it at the
 

2635
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:06,229
see it, we have to look at it at the
right scale.

2636
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:06,239
right scale.
 

2637
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,910
right scale.
Right? And when you choose this right

2638
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:07,920
Right? And when you choose this right
 

2639
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,149
Right? And when you choose this right
scaling,

2640
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:10,159
scaling,
 

2641
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:12,870
scaling,
you can see this kind of non-trivial uh

2642
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:12,880
you can see this kind of non-trivial uh
 

2643
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,550
you can see this kind of non-trivial uh
convergence that comes out that tells

2644
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:14,560
convergence that comes out that tells
 

2645
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,830
convergence that comes out that tells
you something about the uh behavior of

2646
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:17,840
you something about the uh behavior of
 

2647
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,110
you something about the uh behavior of
the quantities that you're interested

2648
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
the quantities that you're interested

in. Okay. Yes. Question.

I don't want to focus on the the limits,

01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,709
uh I want to get at. But you're right
that it could cancel out and you could

2690
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:06,719
that it could cancel out and you could
 

2691
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,790
that it could cancel out and you could
get it to be whatever wherever you want.

2692
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:08,800
get it to be whatever wherever you want.
 

2693
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,070
get it to be whatever wherever you want.
But that's uh not what I want to focus

2694
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:12,080
But that's uh not what I want to focus
 

2695
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:17,110
But that's uh not what I want to focus
on. Okay.

2696
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:17,120

 

2697
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:21,030

Okay. So now let's let's think about

2698
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
Okay. So now let's let's think about
 

2699
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,229
Okay. So now let's let's think about
um this particular set uh this

2700
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:24,239
um this particular set uh this
 

2701
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,669
um this particular set uh this
particular function. So let's say I have

2702
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:25,679
particular function. So let's say I have
 

2703
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,669
particular function. So let's say I have
some function

2704
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:29,679

 

2705
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,390

um of x1 plus x2 plus xn and I have some

2706
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:32,400
um of x1 plus x2 plus xn and I have some
 

2707
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:37,669
um of x1 plus x2 plus xn and I have some
constant c here. Okay, so I define my

2708
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
constant c here. Okay, so I define my
 

2709
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,630
constant c here. Okay, so I define my
some fn of c as the expectation over all

2710
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:40,640
some fn of c as the expectation over all
 

2711
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,270
some fn of c as the expectation over all
of these data points x1 to xn of this

2712
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,280
of these data points x1 to xn of this
 

2713
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,470
of these data points x1 to xn of this
little f of c * this and c is some

2714
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:46,480
little f of c * this and c is some
 

2715
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,310
little f of c * this and c is some
constant belonging to r and let's say f

2716
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:48,320
constant belonging to r and let's say f
 

2717
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,510
constant belonging to r and let's say f
is some bounded continuous function um

2718
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:51,520
is some bounded continuous function um
 

2719
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,070
is some bounded continuous function um
okay

2720
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:54,080
okay
 

2721
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,790
okay
if I reparameterize this and I write

2722
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:56,800
if I reparameterize this and I write
 

2723
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,709
if I reparameterize this and I write
this c

2724
01:12:58,709 --> 01:12:58,719
this c
 

2725
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:03,750
this c
as alpha over<unk> n Okay, so I

2726
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:03,760
as alpha over<unk> n Okay, so I
 

2727
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,350
as alpha over<unk> n Okay, so I
reparameterize it to take into account

2728
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:07,360
reparameterize it to take into account
 

2729
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:12,229
reparameterize it to take into account
the number of things in the sum. Okay,

2730
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:12,239
the number of things in the sum. Okay,
 

2731
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,550
the number of things in the sum. Okay,
and then instead of thinking about this

2732
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:14,560
and then instead of thinking about this
 

2733
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,790
and then instead of thinking about this
fn,

2734
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:16,800
fn,
 

2735
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,270
fn,
I want to think about this function g of

2736
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:19,280
I want to think about this function g of
 

2737
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,110
I want to think about this function g of
alpha. I want to think of this as a

2738
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:21,120
alpha. I want to think of this as a
 

2739
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,709
alpha. I want to think of this as a
function of of alpha.

2740
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:24,719
function of of alpha.
 

2741
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,830
function of of alpha.
Well, as n tends to infinity,

2742
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
Well, as n tends to infinity,
 

2743
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,709
Well, as n tends to infinity,
this thing is going to converge

2744
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:30,719
this thing is going to converge
 

2745
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:33,590
this thing is going to converge
to basically a normal with mean zero and

2746
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:33,600
to basically a normal with mean zero and
 

2747
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,270
to basically a normal with mean zero and
variance alpha square, right? And so as

2748
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,280
variance alpha square, right? And so as
 

2749
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,110
variance alpha square, right? And so as
n grows larger, I've kind of in some

2750
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:41,120
n grows larger, I've kind of in some
 

2751
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,030
n grows larger, I've kind of in some
lost this dependence on n through this

2752
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
lost this dependence on n through this
 

2753
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,669
lost this dependence on n through this
reparameterization, right?

2754
01:13:45,669 --> 01:13:45,679
reparameterization, right?
 

2755
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,510
reparameterization, right?
And so

2756
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:47,520
And so
 

2757
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,070
And so
when I think about gn of alpha,

2758
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:52,080
when I think about gn of alpha,
 

2759
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,229
when I think about gn of alpha,
let's say now I want to optimize this

2760
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:54,239
let's say now I want to optimize this
 

2761
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,390
let's say now I want to optimize this
over alpha. I want to find the optimal

2762
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:56,400
over alpha. I want to find the optimal
 

2763
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,910
over alpha. I want to find the optimal
alpha star of n which is the argument of

2764
01:13:59,910 --> 01:13:59,920
alpha star of n which is the argument of
 

2765
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:04,149
alpha star of n which is the argument of
gn of alpha

2766
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,159

 

2767
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,189

over alpha.

2768
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:07,199
over alpha.
 

2769
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:10,550
over alpha.
As n grows large,

2770
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:10,560
As n grows large,
 

2771
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,910
As n grows large,
gn is converging to being something that

2772
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:13,920
gn is converging to being something that
 

2773
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,110
gn is converging to being something that
doesn't depend on n at all. Right? And

2774
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:17,120
doesn't depend on n at all. Right? And
 

2775
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,790
doesn't depend on n at all. Right? And
so for n large enough,

2776
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:20,800
so for n large enough,
 

2777
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,550
so for n large enough,
one can believe that as

2778
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:24,560
one can believe that as
 

2779
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,550
one can believe that as
that that the specific n you choose

2780
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:26,560
that that the specific n you choose
 

2781
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,390
that that the specific n you choose
isn't going to really matter in terms of

2782
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:28,400
isn't going to really matter in terms of
 

2783
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,030
isn't going to really matter in terms of
finding this argument, this minimizer,

2784
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:31,040
finding this argument, this minimizer,
 

2785
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,590
finding this argument, this minimizer,
right? As you get larger and larger, I

2786
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:33,600
right? As you get larger and larger, I
 

2787
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,350
right? As you get larger and larger, I
can say well if you know this this if

2788
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:37,360
can say well if you know this this if
 

2789
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,229
can say well if you know this this if
alpha knot minimized at n then you know

2790
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:40,239
alpha knot minimized at n then you know
 

2791
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,990
alpha knot minimized at n then you know
maybe alpha knot will also minimize at

2792
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:42,000
maybe alpha knot will also minimize at
 

2793
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,350
maybe alpha knot will also minimize at
n1 if n and n1 are both large enough

2794
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:45,360
n1 if n and n1 are both large enough
 

2795
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,270
n1 if n and n1 are both large enough
right because I'm in this limit where

2796
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:47,280
right because I'm in this limit where
 

2797
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:52,709
right because I'm in this limit where
this model has in a way converged okay

2798
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:52,719
this model has in a way converged okay
 

2799
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,270
this model has in a way converged okay
and the reason I can say this right this

2800
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:55,280
and the reason I can say this right this
 

2801
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,110
and the reason I can say this right this
I can choose I can say oh I can use this

2802
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:57,120
I can choose I can say oh I can use this
 

2803
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,110
I can choose I can say oh I can use this
minimizer alpha not and use it for some

2804
01:14:59,110 --> 01:14:59,120
minimizer alpha not and use it for some
 

2805
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,110
minimizer alpha not and use it for some
other value of

2806
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:01,120
other value of
 

2807
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,430
other value of
is because I have parameterized this

2808
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:03,440
is because I have parameterized this
 

2809
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,510
is because I have parameterized this
function to be in terms of alpha. If I

2810
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:05,520
function to be in terms of alpha. If I
 

2811
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,270
function to be in terms of alpha. If I
had not parameterized it to be in terms

2812
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:07,280
had not parameterized it to be in terms
 

2813
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,830
had not parameterized it to be in terms
of uh in terms of alpha and if I just

2814
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:09,840
of uh in terms of alpha and if I just
 

2815
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,990
of uh in terms of alpha and if I just
had this written as a function of C and

2816
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:12,000
had this written as a function of C and
 

2817
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,590
had this written as a function of C and
this square root and scaling had not

2818
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:13,600
this square root and scaling had not
 

2819
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,350
this square root and scaling had not
brought in I wouldn't be able to see

2820
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:17,360
brought in I wouldn't be able to see
 

2821
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,189
brought in I wouldn't be able to see
this particular convergence and I

2822
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:19,199
this particular convergence and I
 

2823
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:21,830
this particular convergence and I
wouldn't be able to make this claim that

2824
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:21,840
wouldn't be able to make this claim that
 

2825
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,030
wouldn't be able to make this claim that
oh I can choose the optimal value at a

2826
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:25,040
oh I can choose the optimal value at a
 

2827
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,070
oh I can choose the optimal value at a
certain scale and just use it at another

2828
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:28,080
certain scale and just use it at another
 

2829
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,750
certain scale and just use it at another
scale.

2830
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:29,760
scale.
 

2831
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,350
scale.
Okay,

2832
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:31,360
Okay,
 

2833
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,030
Okay,
does everyone see the point that is that

2834
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,040
does everyone see the point that is that
 

2835
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,110
does everyone see the point that is that
I'm trying to make with this example

2836
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:35,120
I'm trying to make with this example
 

2837
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,790
I'm trying to make with this example
that you know of averaging that

2838
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:36,800
that you know of averaging that
 

2839
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,390
that you know of averaging that
everyone's familiar with? Okay, so

2840
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:40,400
everyone's familiar with? Okay, so
 

2841
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,630
everyone's familiar with? Okay, so
that's the idea. Can we do something

2842
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:42,640
that's the idea. Can we do something
 

2843
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,630
that's the idea. Can we do something
similar for neural network

2844
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:44,640
similar for neural network
 

2845
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,630
similar for neural network
hyperparameters, right? It's not clear

2846
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:46,640
hyperparameters, right? It's not clear
 

2847
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,070

that when you have um have a small

2848
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:50,080
that when you have um have a small
 

2849
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,189
that when you have um have a small
network and a big network, yes, I want

2850
01:15:53,189 --> 01:15:53,199
network and a big network, yes, I want
 

2851
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,110
network and a big network, yes, I want
to train on the small network and I want

2852
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:55,120
to train on the small network and I want
 

2853
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,270
to train on the small network and I want
to be able to use it on the big network.

2854
01:15:57,270 --> 01:15:57,280
to be able to use it on the big network.
 

2855
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,189
to be able to use it on the big network.
I want to do some scaling, but what

2856
01:15:59,189 --> 01:15:59,199
I want to do some scaling, but what
 

2857
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:00,709
I want to do some scaling, but what
scaling?

2858
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:00,719
scaling?
 

2859
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,630
scaling?
Right? If the width doubles, do I

2860
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:02,640
Right? If the width doubles, do I
 

2861
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,350
Right? If the width doubles, do I
double? Do I have? Do I quadruple? Like

2862
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:05,360
double? Do I have? Do I quadruple? Like
 

2863
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,709
double? Do I have? Do I quadruple? Like
some scaling makes sense. That's

2864
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
some scaling makes sense. That's
 

2865
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,870
some scaling makes sense. That's
intuitive. But what scaling actually

2866
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:08,880
intuitive. But what scaling actually
 

2867
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,030
intuitive. But what scaling actually
matters? And it's not obvious to figure

2868
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:11,040
matters? And it's not obvious to figure
 

2869
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,229
matters? And it's not obvious to figure
that out, right? And what the MUP paper

2870
01:16:14,229 --> 01:16:14,239
that out, right? And what the MUP paper
 

2871
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:15,910
that out, right? And what the MUP paper
is bringing forth is it's telling you

2872
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:15,920
is bringing forth is it's telling you
 

2873
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,709
is bringing forth is it's telling you
what that scaling is, right? How do I

2874
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:18,719
what that scaling is, right? How do I
 

2875
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,070
what that scaling is, right? How do I
look at the problem? And it's saying

2876
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:20,080
look at the problem? And it's saying
 

2877
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,830
look at the problem? And it's saying
that look you want to be looking at it

2878
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,840
that look you want to be looking at it
 

2879
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,149
that look you want to be looking at it
in terms of the dimensions of the weight

2880
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
in terms of the dimensions of the weight
 

2881
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,550
in terms of the dimensions of the weight
matrices that are in your that are in

2882
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:26,560
matrices that are in your that are in
 

2883
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,669
matrices that are in your that are in
between that are in your layers.

2884
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:29,679
between that are in your layers.
 

2885
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,430
between that are in your layers.
Okay, that's the perspective that it's

2886
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:31,440
Okay, that's the perspective that it's
 

2887
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,709
Okay, that's the perspective that it's
trying to bring out here like you know

2888
01:16:32,709 --> 01:16:32,719
trying to bring out here like you know
 

2889
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,470
trying to bring out here like you know
in this case the right scaling was

2890
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:34,480
in this case the right scaling was
 

2891
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,390
in this case the right scaling was
square root n similarly what it's trying

2892
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:36,400
square root n similarly what it's trying
 

2893
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,350
square root n similarly what it's trying
to say is that right scaling is in terms

2894
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:39,360
to say is that right scaling is in terms
 

2895
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,350
to say is that right scaling is in terms
of those dimensions of the matrices.

2896
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:41,360
of those dimensions of the matrices.
 

2897
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,350
of those dimensions of the matrices.
Okay.

2898
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:45,360

 

2899
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,510

So in the last little bit of time that I

2900
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:47,520
So in the last little bit of time that I
 

2901
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,229
So in the last little bit of time that I
have, what I want to do

2902
01:16:50,229 --> 01:16:50,239
have, what I want to do
 

2903
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,550
have, what I want to do
is I want to

2904
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:52,560
is I want to
 

2905
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,470
is I want to
give you a little bit more detail on

2906
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:54,480
give you a little bit more detail on
 

2907
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,630
give you a little bit more detail on
what this MUP parameterization is trying

2908
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:56,640
what this MUP parameterization is trying
 

2909
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,790
what this MUP parameterization is trying
to say.

2910
01:16:58,790 --> 01:16:58,800
to say.
 

2911
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,510
to say.
And what I want to say to you is that

2912
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:01,520
And what I want to say to you is that
 

2913
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,030
And what I want to say to you is that
look, we've we have two things and I

2914
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
look, we've we have two things and I
 

2915
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,790
look, we've we have two things and I
will argue to you that both of these are

2916
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:06,800
will argue to you that both of these are
 

2917
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,550
will argue to you that both of these are
some things are things that are that are

2918
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:08,560
some things are things that are that are
 

2919
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,430
some things are things that are that are
desirable. Okay,

2920
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:11,440
desirable. Okay,
 

2921
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:15,270
desirable. Okay,
we want to look at these different uh

2922
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:15,280
we want to look at these different uh
 

2923
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,750
we want to look at these different uh
let me use a different color these

2924
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:17,760
let me use a different color these
 

2925
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:23,590
let me use a different color these
hidden layers of our network

2926
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:23,600

 

2927
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,149

and we want to have these hidden layers

2928
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:26,159
and we want to have these hidden layers
 

2929
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:29,510
and we want to have these hidden layers
do two things. One is that we want them

2930
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:29,520
do two things. One is that we want them
 

2931
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,030
do two things. One is that we want them
to be of a reasonable size. Okay, we

2932
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:33,040
to be of a reasonable size. Okay, we
 

2933
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,590
to be of a reasonable size. Okay, we
want to have all of these entries be of

2934
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:35,600
want to have all of these entries be of
 

2935
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,189
want to have all of these entries be of
order one. Right? That's how we got to

2936
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:37,199
order one. Right? That's how we got to
 

2937
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,030
order one. Right? That's how we got to
the RMS norm in the first place when we

2938
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:39,040
the RMS norm in the first place when we
 

2939
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:39,990
the RMS norm in the first place when we
started talking about Xavier

2940
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:40,000
started talking about Xavier
 

2941
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,470
started talking about Xavier
initialization. Okay, because these

2942
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:42,480
initialization. Okay, because these
 

2943
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,229
initialization. Okay, because these
things being too small or too big are

2944
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:44,239
things being too small or too big are
 

2945
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,709
things being too small or too big are
bad for us. Okay.

2946
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:46,719
bad for us. Okay.
 

2947
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:48,709
bad for us. Okay.
And the second thing that we want to

2948
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:48,719
And the second thing that we want to
 

2949
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,709
And the second thing that we want to
have is we want to have that these

2950
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:52,719
have is we want to have that these
 

2951
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:56,630
have is we want to have that these
layers are actually changing when we

2952
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:56,640
layers are actually changing when we
 

2953
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,870
layers are actually changing when we
update them, right? we don't want to

2954
01:17:58,870 --> 01:17:58,880
update them, right? we don't want to
 

2955
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:05,110
update them, right? we don't want to
have uh them to be in some sense uh

2956
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:05,120
have uh them to be in some sense uh
 

2957
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,110
have uh them to be in some sense uh
not changing at all.

2958
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:09,120

 

2959
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,310

And so this leads to these two desired

2960
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:12,320
And so this leads to these two desired
 

2961
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,430
And so this leads to these two desired
properties for what uh this paper this

2962
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:15,440
properties for what uh this paper this
 

2963
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,709
properties for what uh this paper this
is the Yang and Bernstein and Simon

2964
01:18:18,709 --> 01:18:18,719
is the Yang and Bernstein and Simon
 

2965
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:21,750
is the Yang and Bernstein and Simon
paper

2966
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:21,760

 

2967
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,830

call desired properties for feature

2968
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:23,840
call desired properties for feature
 

2969
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,390
call desired properties for feature
learning. they talk about these two uh

2970
01:18:26,390 --> 01:18:26,400
learning. they talk about these two uh
 

2971
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,990
learning. they talk about these two uh
desiderata.

2972
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,000
desiderata.
 

2973
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,510
desiderata.
The first is that the RMS norm of your

2974
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:33,520
The first is that the RMS norm of your
 

2975
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,669
The first is that the RMS norm of your
layer should be approximately order one

2976
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:35,679
layer should be approximately order one
 

2977
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:38,790
layer should be approximately order one
should be order one and the second is

2978
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:38,800
should be order one and the second is
 

2979
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,950
should be order one and the second is
that

2980
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:40,960
that
 

2981
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,910
that
the change in your layer should also be

2982
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:43,920
the change in your layer should also be
 

2983
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:48,950
the change in your layer should also be
order one. Okay,

2984
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:48,960

 

2985
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,030

I want to point out that these thetas

2986
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040
I want to point out that these thetas
 

2987
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,510
I want to point out that these thetas
are basically with respect to the

2988
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:53,520
are basically with respect to the
 

2989
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,750
are basically with respect to the
network width. So when I think about the

2990
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:57,760
network width. So when I think about the
 

2991
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,590
network width. So when I think about the
value of my HL and the value of my delta

2992
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:01,600
value of my HL and the value of my delta
 

2993
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,270
value of my HL and the value of my delta
HL,

2994
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:03,280
HL,
 

2995
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,310
HL,
my update is going to be much smaller

2996
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:06,320
my update is going to be much smaller
 

2997
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,149
my update is going to be much smaller
than my actual uh feature vector because

2998
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:10,159
than my actual uh feature vector because
 

2999
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:11,669
than my actual uh feature vector because
it's going to be scaled by some tiny

3000
01:19:11,669 --> 01:19:11,679
it's going to be scaled by some tiny
 

3001
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,229
it's going to be scaled by some tiny
learning rate, right? But when I think

3002
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:14,239
learning rate, right? But when I think
 

3003
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:16,470
learning rate, right? But when I think
about it in terms of the network width

3004
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:16,480
about it in terms of the network width
 

3005
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,350
about it in terms of the network width
or the the fan in and fan out the D in

3006
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:19,360
or the the fan in and fan out the D in
 

3007
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,950
or the the fan in and fan out the D in
and D out um these are of the same size

3008
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:22,960
and D out um these are of the same size
 

3009
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,709
and D out um these are of the same size
is what this is saying. Question

3010
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:26,719
is what this is saying. Question
 

3011
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:32,470
is what this is saying. Question
HL here.

3012
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,480

 

3013
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,550

>> Yes, this delta HL is referring to the

3014
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:34,560
>> Yes, this delta HL is referring to the
 

3015
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:41,669
>> Yes, this delta HL is referring to the
change of HL at each gradient step.

3016
01:19:41,669 --> 01:19:41,679

 

3017
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,149

Okay,

3018
01:19:44,149 --> 01:19:44,159
Okay,
 

3019
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,709
Okay,
so just to recap, we know from Xavier

3020
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:46,719
so just to recap, we know from Xavier
 

3021
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,870
so just to recap, we know from Xavier
initialization that we want to have

3022
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
initialization that we want to have
 

3023
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,470
initialization that we want to have
something like this. We want we like the

3024
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:50,480
something like this. We want we like the
 

3025
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:54,390
something like this. We want we like the
RMS norms to be uh fixed.

3026
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:54,400
RMS norms to be uh fixed.
 

3027
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,470
RMS norms to be uh fixed.
So we want these to be all approximately

3028
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:56,480
So we want these to be all approximately
 

3029
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,030
So we want these to be all approximately
one. And this is adding a second desired

3030
01:19:59,030 --> 01:19:59,040
one. And this is adding a second desired
 

3031
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,709
one. And this is adding a second desired
property which is saying that the

3032
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719
property which is saying that the
 

3033
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,470
property which is saying that the
updates should also be approximately uh

3034
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:04,480
updates should also be approximately uh
 

3035
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,390
updates should also be approximately uh
order one

3036
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:06,400
order one
 

3037
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,910
order one
when you look at it as a function of the

3038
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:07,920
when you look at it as a function of the
 

3039
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,950
when you look at it as a function of the
width. Yes, question.

3040
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:08,960
width. Yes, question.
 

3041
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,350
width. Yes, question.
>> In this case, h is the actual values

3042
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:11,360
>> In this case, h is the actual values
 

3043
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,550
>> In this case, h is the actual values
stored in each entry, right?

3044
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:14,560
stored in each entry, right?
 

3045
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,189
stored in each entry, right?
>> H is yes. So, H um H are basically my uh

3046
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:19,199
>> H is yes. So, H um H are basically my uh
 

3047
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:22,709
>> H is yes. So, H um H are basically my uh
my my hidden layers. Yeah, the the

3048
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:22,719
my my hidden layers. Yeah, the the
 

3049
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,830
my my hidden layers. Yeah, the the
values. Um W's are what I'm going to use

3050
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:25,840
values. Um W's are what I'm going to use
 

3051
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,110
values. Um W's are what I'm going to use
to talk about my weights. And I'm going

3052
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:27,120
to talk about my weights. And I'm going
 

3053
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,470
to talk about my weights. And I'm going
to connect the two of them in just a

3054
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:28,480
to connect the two of them in just a
 

3055
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,790
to connect the two of them in just a
minute. So, basically, I have H L is

3056
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:32,800
minute. So, basically, I have H L is
 

3057
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,310
minute. So, basically, I have H L is
equal to W * HL minus one. Okay, if you

3058
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:36,320
equal to W * HL minus one. Okay, if you
 

3059
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,750
equal to W * HL minus one. Okay, if you
ignore the bias and you ignore the

3060
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:37,760
ignore the bias and you ignore the
 

3061
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,669
ignore the bias and you ignore the
nonlinearity

3062
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:39,679
nonlinearity
 

3063
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,470
nonlinearity
and the the weights are where the main

3064
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,480
and the the weights are where the main
 

3065
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:48,310
and the the weights are where the main
scaling relationships are coming from.

3066
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320

 

3067
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,830

We're good. Okay. So, how can we achieve

3068
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:51,840
We're good. Okay. So, how can we achieve
 

3069
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,350
We're good. Okay. So, how can we achieve
this des uh these desired properties?

3070
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:55,360
this des uh these desired properties?
 

3071
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,950
this des uh these desired properties?
So, if we ignore the bias and the

3072
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:56,960
So, if we ignore the bias and the
 

3073
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,110
So, if we ignore the bias and the
nonlinearity, what I have is I can just

3074
01:20:59,110 --> 01:20:59,120
nonlinearity, what I have is I can just
 

3075
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:03,350
nonlinearity, what I have is I can just
write HL as WL * HL minus one.

3076
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:03,360
write HL as WL * HL minus one.
 

3077
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,950
write HL as WL * HL minus one.
And now if HL minus one align for

3078
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:06,960
And now if HL minus one align for
 

3079
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,950
And now if HL minus one align for
example with the top singular vector

3080
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:08,960
example with the top singular vector
 

3081
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,470
example with the top singular vector
vector of WL I can just take the

3082
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:12,480
vector of WL I can just take the
 

3083
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,229
vector of WL I can just take the
spectral norm on both sides of this

3084
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:14,239
spectral norm on both sides of this
 

3085
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:15,990
spectral norm on both sides of this
equation and I can write this as an

3086
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:16,000
equation and I can write this as an
 

3087
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,990
equation and I can write this as an
inequality. Right? In general I have an

3088
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:18,000
inequality. Right? In general I have an
 

3089
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,590
inequality. Right? In general I have an
inequality here. But if I know that this

3090
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:21,600
inequality here. But if I know that this
 

3091
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,709
inequality here. But if I know that this
is aligned to the largest singular

3092
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:24,719
is aligned to the largest singular
 

3093
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:27,030
is aligned to the largest singular
direction or is approximately there then

3094
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,040
direction or is approximately there then
 

3095
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:31,350
direction or is approximately there then
I can just write this as an equality.

3096
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:31,360

 

3097
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,750

Everyone with me here?

3098
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:33,760
Everyone with me here?
 

3099
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,350
Everyone with me here?
I'm not going to show that this

3100
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:35,360
I'm not going to show that this
 

3101
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,910
I'm not going to show that this
alignment is the case. The paper argues

3102
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:37,920
alignment is the case. The paper argues
 

3103
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,669
alignment is the case. The paper argues
for that, but let's just take that for

3104
01:21:39,669 --> 01:21:39,679
for that, but let's just take that for
 

3105
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:42,149
for that, but let's just take that for
granted um

3106
01:21:42,149 --> 01:21:42,159
granted um
 

3107
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:44,790
granted um
for now. And then again, just

3108
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:44,800
for now. And then again, just
 

3109
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,910
for now. And then again, just
substituting the RMS norm for the uh

3110
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:47,920
substituting the RMS norm for the uh
 

3111
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,430
substituting the RMS norm for the uh
spectral norm. What we get is that well,

3112
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:51,440
spectral norm. What we get is that well,
 

3113
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,870
spectral norm. What we get is that well,
we want our W's to be approximately of

3114
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:54,880
we want our W's to be approximately of
 

3115
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,270
we want our W's to be approximately of
this order, D out by DN. But the easier

3116
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:57,280
this order, D out by DN. But the easier
 

3117
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,550
this order, D out by DN. But the easier
way to think about it in the way that

3118
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:58,560
way to think about it in the way that
 

3119
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,390
way to think about it in the way that
we're used to thinking about it is to

3120
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:00,400
we're used to thinking about it is to
 

3121
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,310
we're used to thinking about it is to
just it brings back this thing that

3122
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:02,320
just it brings back this thing that
 

3123
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,510
just it brings back this thing that
we've been thinking about uh or is that

3124
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:05,520
we've been thinking about uh or is that
 

3125
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,910
we've been thinking about uh or is that
you know we want to have the RMS to RMS

3126
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:07,920
you know we want to have the RMS to RMS
 

3127
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,750
you know we want to have the RMS to RMS
induced norm of our weight matrix to be

3128
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:09,760
induced norm of our weight matrix to be
 

3129
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:19,270
induced norm of our weight matrix to be
approximately uh theta 1. Okay.

3130
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:19,280

 

3131
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,830

So this gives us basically if I have

3132
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:21,840
So this gives us basically if I have
 

3133
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,910
So this gives us basically if I have
this

3134
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:23,920
this
 

3135
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,070
this
if this is of if this is approximately

3136
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:26,080
if this is of if this is approximately
 

3137
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:31,189
if this is of if this is approximately
RMS to RMS uh or what I want to say okay

3138
01:22:31,189 --> 01:22:31,199
RMS to RMS uh or what I want to say okay
 

3139
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,669
RMS to RMS uh or what I want to say okay
let me come back

3140
01:22:33,669 --> 01:22:33,679
let me come back
 

3141
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:36,070
let me come back
this has the right RMS induced norm this

3142
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:36,080
this has the right RMS induced norm this
 

3143
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,390
this has the right RMS induced norm this
has the right RMS induced norm gives me

3144
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:38,400
has the right RMS induced norm gives me
 

3145
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,149
has the right RMS induced norm gives me
that this has the right RMS induced norm

3146
01:22:40,149 --> 01:22:40,159
that this has the right RMS induced norm
 

3147
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:44,229
that this has the right RMS induced norm
right if this is order one RMS to RMS

3148
01:22:44,229 --> 01:22:44,239
right if this is order one RMS to RMS
 

3149
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,790
right if this is order one RMS to RMS
norm this is order one RMS to RMS norm I

3150
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:46,800
norm this is order one RMS to RMS norm I
 

3151
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,390
norm this is order one RMS to RMS norm I
can conclude that this will be order one

3152
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:48,400
can conclude that this will be order one
 

3153
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,709
can conclude that this will be order one
RMS to RMSS norm by just an induction

3154
01:22:50,709 --> 01:22:50,719
RMS to RMSS norm by just an induction
 

3155
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:55,590
RMS to RMSS norm by just an induction
straight up argument. Okay, doing um

3156
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:55,600
straight up argument. Okay, doing um
 

3157
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,270
straight up argument. Okay, doing um
exactly this calculation here.

3158
01:22:59,270 --> 01:22:59,280
exactly this calculation here.
 

3159
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,189
exactly this calculation here.
Okay,

3160
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
Okay,
 

3161
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,669
Okay,
a similar argument. I'm running short on

3162
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:03,679
a similar argument. I'm running short on
 

3163
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,270
a similar argument. I'm running short on
time to do this out. So maybe I'll do

3164
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,280
time to do this out. So maybe I'll do
 

3165
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,510
time to do this out. So maybe I'll do
this again next time. Um but I want to

3166
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,520
this again next time. Um but I want to
 

3167
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,350
this again next time. Um but I want to
just get the idea out to you.

3168
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:11,360
just get the idea out to you.
 

3169
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,590
just get the idea out to you.
I also want to make sure that my updates

3170
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:13,600
I also want to make sure that my updates
 

3171
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,750
I also want to make sure that my updates
have the same order.

3172
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:15,760
have the same order.
 

3173
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,590
have the same order.
It's the same idea and the same

3174
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:17,600
It's the same idea and the same
 

3175
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,550
It's the same idea and the same
calculation. All I'm going to do here is

3176
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:20,560
calculation. All I'm going to do here is
 

3177
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:26,149
calculation. All I'm going to do here is
now I'm going to take the same equation.

3178
01:23:26,149 --> 01:23:26,159

 

3179
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,870

Oops.

3180
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:28,880
Oops.
 

3181
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,870
Oops.
I'm going to take the same equation

3182
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:32,880

 

3183
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,750

and now I can take the gradient and I

3184
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:35,760
and now I can take the gradient and I
 

3185
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,790
and now I can take the gradient and I
just do uh I even forget what this is

3186
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:38,800
just do uh I even forget what this is
 

3187
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,709
just do uh I even forget what this is
called. What is this called? The rule of

3188
01:23:40,709 --> 01:23:40,719
called. What is this called? The rule of
 

3189
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,030
called. What is this called? The rule of
derivatives.

3190
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:43,040
derivatives.
 

3191
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:46,149
derivatives.
However you do you take the derivatives

3192
01:23:46,149 --> 01:23:46,159
However you do you take the derivatives
 

3193
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:49,270
However you do you take the derivatives
and then um

3194
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:49,280
and then um
 

3195
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,110
and then um
you can see that I can write this as

3196
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:51,120
you can see that I can write this as
 

3197
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:55,430
you can see that I can write this as
delta w * hlus one plus uh wl times the

3198
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:55,440
delta w * hlus one plus uh wl times the
 

3199
01:23:55,440 --> 01:24:00,149
delta w * hlus one plus uh wl times the
the gradient here. Um and now if I look

3200
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:00,159
the gradient here. Um and now if I look
 

3201
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:03,270
the gradient here. Um and now if I look
at uh

3202
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:03,280
at uh
 

3203
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,149
at uh
if I look at this what I get is that

3204
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:06,159
if I look at this what I get is that
 

3205
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:09,510
if I look at this what I get is that
basically this guy is going to be like

3206
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:09,520
basically this guy is going to be like
 

3207
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:13,990
basically this guy is going to be like
this from what we know. and or if I can

3208
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:14,000
this from what we know. and or if I can
 

3209
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,750
this from what we know. and or if I can
show that this is of this order, this is

3210
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:15,760
show that this is of this order, this is
 

3211
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,510
show that this is of this order, this is
always going to be like this. And so I

3212
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:17,520
always going to be like this. And so I
 

3213
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,590
always going to be like this. And so I
will get the desired properties again on

3214
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:19,600
will get the desired properties again on
 

3215
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,590
will get the desired properties again on
my update for my

3216
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:23,600
my update for my
 

3217
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,390
my update for my
uh hidden layers as well. Okay, so I'm

3218
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:26,400
uh hidden layers as well. Okay, so I'm
 

3219
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,149
uh hidden layers as well. Okay, so I'm
not going through this math particularly

3220
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:28,159
not going through this math particularly
 

3221
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,390
not going through this math particularly
carefully because we don't have enough

3222
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:30,400
carefully because we don't have enough
 

3223
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,629
carefully because we don't have enough
time, but I want you to just have one

3224
01:24:32,629 --> 01:24:32,639
time, but I want you to just have one
 

3225
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:35,270
time, but I want you to just have one
takeaway, right? The takeaway that I

3226
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:35,280
takeaway, right? The takeaway that I
 

3227
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:39,669
takeaway, right? The takeaway that I
want you to see is that what the MUP

3228
01:24:39,669 --> 01:24:39,679
want you to see is that what the MUP
 

3229
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:41,990
want you to see is that what the MUP
paper or that parameterization does is

3230
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:42,000
paper or that parameterization does is
 

3231
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,870
paper or that parameterization does is
it allows you to say let me take a small

3232
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:44,880
it allows you to say let me take a small
 

3233
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,629
it allows you to say let me take a small
model, let me let me train things on it

3234
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:48,639
model, let me let me train things on it
 

3235
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,470
model, let me let me train things on it
and then I will take their param the

3236
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:50,480
and then I will take their param the
 

3237
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,390
and then I will take their param the
parameters from that small model

3238
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:52,400
parameters from that small model
 

3239
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,870
parameters from that small model
transfer them to a bigger parameter with

3240
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:54,880
transfer them to a bigger parameter with
 

3241
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,870
transfer them to a bigger parameter with
the appropriate scaling to change the

3242
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:56,880
the appropriate scaling to change the
 

3243
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,470
the appropriate scaling to change the
weights given by the dimensions of these

3244
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:00,480
weights given by the dimensions of these
 

3245
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,790
weights given by the dimensions of these
uh input matrix weight of these of these

3246
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:02,800
uh input matrix weight of these of these
 

3247
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,870
uh input matrix weight of these of these
weight uh of these weight matrices,

3248
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:04,880
weight uh of these weight matrices,
 

3249
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,390
weight uh of these weight matrices,
right? And while the MUP paper looked at

3250
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:08,400
right? And while the MUP paper looked at
 

3251
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,750
right? And while the MUP paper looked at
this and came at this from a complicated

3252
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:11,760
this and came at this from a complicated
 

3253
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:14,229
this and came at this from a complicated
tensor math perspective,

3254
01:25:14,229 --> 01:25:14,239
tensor math perspective,
 

3255
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:17,189
tensor math perspective,
a simpler linear algebraic perspective

3256
01:25:17,189 --> 01:25:17,199
a simpler linear algebraic perspective
 

3257
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:21,510
a simpler linear algebraic perspective
can bring out in a sense the same

3258
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:21,520
can bring out in a sense the same
 

3259
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,430
can bring out in a sense the same
scaling laws making it much more

3260
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:23,440
scaling laws making it much more
 

3261
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,030
scaling laws making it much more
interpretable, understandable and

3262
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:25,040
interpretable, understandable and
 

3263
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,950
interpretable, understandable and
leading to therefore more progress

3264
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:26,960
leading to therefore more progress
 

3265
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,950
leading to therefore more progress
because you can understand it simply you

3266
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:28,960
because you can understand it simply you
 

3267
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,110
because you can understand it simply you
can actually work with it more easily.

3268
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:31,120
can actually work with it more easily.
 

3269
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:35,830
can actually work with it more easily.
Okay, we will pick up next time.

3270
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:35,840
Okay, we will pick up next time.
 

3271
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,430
Okay, we will pick up next time.
