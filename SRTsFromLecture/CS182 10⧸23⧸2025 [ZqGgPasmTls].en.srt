1
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,070

we can get started. Okay. So, I'm going

2
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
we can get started. Okay. So, I'm going
 

3
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,629
we can get started. Okay. So, I'm going
to continue where uh we left off last

4
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
to continue where uh we left off last
 

5
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,150
to continue where uh we left off last
class about state space models. And we

6
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
class about state space models. And we
 

7
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,550
class about state space models. And we
started talking with about this with the

8
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
started talking with about this with the
 

9
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,150
started talking with about this with the
two key problems that we were trying to

10
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
two key problems that we were trying to
 

11
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,230
two key problems that we were trying to
address with RNN's, right? We liked

12
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
address with RNN's, right? We liked
 

13
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,390
address with RNN's, right? We liked
RNN's because they had this concept of

14
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
RNN's because they had this concept of
 

15
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,909
RNN's because they had this concept of
state and therefore were good at

16
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
state and therefore were good at
 

17
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,950
state and therefore were good at
capturing long range dependencies. Um

18
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
capturing long range dependencies. Um
 

19
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,749
capturing long range dependencies. Um
but we had the problem that you know

20
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
but we had the problem that you know
 

21
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,110
but we had the problem that you know
when you had uh lots of sequential

22
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
when you had uh lots of sequential
 

23
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,550
when you had uh lots of sequential
multipliers and you would actually have

24
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
multipliers and you would actually have
 

25
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,189
multipliers and you would actually have
these decaying weights on the past and

26
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
these decaying weights on the past and
 

27
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,790
these decaying weights on the past and
you would start forgetting the past. So

28
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
you would start forgetting the past. So
 

29
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,230
you would start forgetting the past. So
you had the idea that maybe the state

30
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
you had the idea that maybe the state
 

31
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,230
you had the idea that maybe the state
could capture the past but it would be

32
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
could capture the past but it would be
 

33
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,230
could capture the past but it would be
hard to actually do this. And the other

34
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
hard to actually do this. And the other
 

35
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,070
hard to actually do this. And the other
challenge with RNN's was that they were

36
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
challenge with RNN's was that they were
 

37
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,670
challenge with RNN's was that they were
uh hard to train parallelly. And so what

38
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
uh hard to train parallelly. And so what
 

39
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,830
uh hard to train parallelly. And so what
we did was we said okay well let's get

40
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
we did was we said okay well let's get
 

41
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,310
we did was we said okay well let's get
rid of this horizontal nonlinearity that

42
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
rid of this horizontal nonlinearity that
 

43
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,590
rid of this horizontal nonlinearity that
was blocking us. And what we did was we

44
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
was blocking us. And what we did was we
 

45
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,270
was blocking us. And what we did was we
said okay let's just think of this as a

46
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
said okay let's just think of this as a
 

47
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,430
said okay let's just think of this as a
linear system. Think of it as a state

48
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
linear system. Think of it as a state
 

49
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,629
linear system. Think of it as a state
space model. And we can then use

50
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
space model. And we can then use
 

51
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,670
space model. And we can then use
this equation essentially.

52
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
this equation essentially.
 

53
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,710
this equation essentially.
And given the weights A, B, and C, we

54
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
And given the weights A, B, and C, we
 

55
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,270
And given the weights A, B, and C, we
can just use a convolution to actually

56
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
can just use a convolution to actually
 

57
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,830
can just use a convolution to actually
get our um training to work, right? And

58
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
get our um training to work, right? And
 

59
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,830
get our um training to work, right? And
the fact that it's a convolution and

60
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
the fact that it's a convolution and
 

61
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,309
the fact that it's a convolution and
that h of t does not have to wait for

62
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
that h of t does not have to wait for
 

63
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,710
that h of t does not have to wait for
the computation of h of t minus one to

64
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
the computation of h of t minus one to
 

65
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,469
the computation of h of t minus one to
be able to compute it. I can directly

66
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
be able to compute it. I can directly
 

67
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,230
be able to compute it. I can directly
parallelly compute it given all of my

68
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
parallelly compute it given all of my
 

69
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,150
parallelly compute it given all of my
inputs. Therefore, I can speed up

70
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
inputs. Therefore, I can speed up
 

71
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,110
inputs. Therefore, I can speed up
training. Everyone remember this? And we

72
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
training. Everyone remember this? And we
 

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,469
training. Everyone remember this? And we
said that if you did it straight using

74
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
said that if you did it straight using
 

75
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,469
said that if you did it straight using
the convolution way, we would have a

76
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
the convolution way, we would have a
 

77
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,390
the convolution way, we would have a
total of uh order t^2 compute. But if we

78
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
total of uh order t^2 compute. But if we
 

79
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,430
total of uh order t^2 compute. But if we
use the nice fft trick, then we can get

80
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
use the nice fft trick, then we can get
 

81
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,309
use the nice fft trick, then we can get
to order t log t. And we had this idea

82
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
to order t log t. And we had this idea
 

83
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,070
to order t log t. And we had this idea
of how to do this using order t log t.

84
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
of how to do this using order t log t.
 

85
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,909
of how to do this using order t log t.
But we had the issue with well we

86
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
But we had the issue with well we
 

87
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,590
But we had the issue with well we
actually have vectors here. The fft is

88
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
actually have vectors here. The fft is
 

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,870
actually have vectors here. The fft is
set up for scalar uh inputs. Everyone

90
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
set up for scalar uh inputs. Everyone
 

91
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,670
set up for scalar uh inputs. Everyone
remember this context from last time?

92
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
remember this context from last time?
 

93
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,749
remember this context from last time?
We're good.

94
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
We're good.
 

95
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,510
We're good.
And then the one other thing we talked

96
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
And then the one other thing we talked
 

97
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,390
And then the one other thing we talked
about was that hey it's not just about

98
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
about was that hey it's not just about
 

99
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,710
about was that hey it's not just about
computing this long convolution. But we

100
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
computing this long convolution. But we
 

101
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,550
computing this long convolution. But we
also have to compute the coefficients of

102
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
also have to compute the coefficients of
 

103
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,390
also have to compute the coefficients of
the long convolution. And these

104
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
the long convolution. And these
 

105
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,070
the long convolution. And these
coefficients are also well they're big

106
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
coefficients are also well they're big
 

107
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,150
coefficients are also well they're big
matrices right? You have this c * a to

108
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
matrices right? You have this c * a to
 

109
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,830
matrices right? You have this c * a to
the k * b. Computing these powers of a

110
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
the k * b. Computing these powers of a
 

111
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,550
the k * b. Computing these powers of a
can also be quite expensive. So what was

112
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
can also be quite expensive. So what was
 

113
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,790
can also be quite expensive. So what was
the trick that we came up with to handle

114
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
the trick that we came up with to handle
 

115
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,390
the trick that we came up with to handle
the fact that computing large powers of

116
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
the fact that computing large powers of
 

117
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,550
the fact that computing large powers of
a is a problem?

118
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
a is a problem?
 

119
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,870
a is a problem?
>> Make a diagonal. just make a diagonal,

120
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
>> Make a diagonal. just make a diagonal,
 

121
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,070
>> Make a diagonal. just make a diagonal,
right? And so we can say that once we

122
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
right? And so we can say that once we
 

123
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,550
right? And so we can say that once we
have set up a as diagonal, we can

124
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
have set up a as diagonal, we can
 

125
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,830
have set up a as diagonal, we can
represent the entire family of systems

126
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
represent the entire family of systems
 

127
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,909
represent the entire family of systems
that can be represented by

128
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
that can be represented by
 

129
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,870
that can be represented by
diagonalizable A's because again we're

130
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
diagonalizable A's because again we're
 

131
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,950
diagonalizable A's because again we're
learning these these weights anyway. So

132
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
learning these these weights anyway. So
 

133
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,430
learning these these weights anyway. So
we can essentially learn the basis and

134
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
we can essentially learn the basis and
 

135
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,029
we can essentially learn the basis and
therefore there's a huge family of

136
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
therefore there's a huge family of
 

137
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,629
therefore there's a huge family of
things that can be represented. the

138
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
things that can be represented. the
 

139
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,230
things that can be represented. the
things that cannot be represented are

140
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
things that cannot be represented are
 

141
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,830
things that cannot be represented are
such things that um have some repeated

142
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
such things that um have some repeated
 

143
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,430
such things that um have some repeated
values.

144
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
values.
 

145
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,909
values.
Uh but you know we we give that up

146
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
Uh but you know we we give that up
 

147
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,430
Uh but you know we we give that up
basically. Okay

148
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
basically. Okay
 

149
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,230
basically. Okay
great. So we had this diagonal A and

150
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
great. So we had this diagonal A and
 

151
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,950
great. So we had this diagonal A and
then we said that okay you granted me

152
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
then we said that okay you granted me
 

153
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,990
then we said that okay you granted me
that we are going to say that we can use

154
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
that we are going to say that we can use
 

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,469
that we are going to say that we can use
the FFT trick even though our inputs

156
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
the FFT trick even though our inputs
 

157
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,990
the FFT trick even though our inputs
were not actually um

158
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
were not actually um
 

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,629
were not actually um
scalar inputs. We had vectors going in

160
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
scalar inputs. We had vectors going in
 

161
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,189
scalar inputs. We had vectors going in
this everything U's and X or the X's and

162
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
this everything U's and X or the X's and
 

163
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,350
this everything U's and X or the X's and
H's were all vectors. And so what we

164
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
H's were all vectors. And so what we
 

165
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,189
H's were all vectors. And so what we
wanted to start off with today was

166
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
wanted to start off with today was
 

167
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,790
wanted to start off with today was
saying, well, how can we handle the FFT

168
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
saying, well, how can we handle the FFT
 

169
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,950
saying, well, how can we handle the FFT
given that all of our inputs are

170
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
given that all of our inputs are
 

171
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,270
given that all of our inputs are
actually vectors?

172
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
actually vectors?
 

173
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,029
actually vectors?
Everyone caught up to speed and remember

174
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
Everyone caught up to speed and remember
 

175
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,629
Everyone caught up to speed and remember
what we talked about last time in that

176
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
what we talked about last time in that
 

177
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,430
what we talked about last time in that
quick recap? Okay, great.

178
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
quick recap? Okay, great.
 

179
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,830
quick recap? Okay, great.
Okay, so now let's start thinking about

180
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
Okay, so now let's start thinking about
 

181
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,310
Okay, so now let's start thinking about
this.

182
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
this.
 

183
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,829
this.
So we're going to consider our state

184
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
So we're going to consider our state
 

185
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,029
So we're going to consider our state
space model or our system as h of t is a

186
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
space model or our system as h of t is a
 

187
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,670
space model or our system as h of t is a
h of t minus 1 plus bx of t and then y

188
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
h of t minus 1 plus bx of t and then y
 

189
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,750
h of t minus 1 plus bx of t and then y
of t is c h of t plus dx of t. y of t is

190
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
of t is c h of t plus dx of t. y of t is
 

191
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,829
of t is c h of t plus dx of t. y of t is
our output x of t is our input. Right?

192
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
our output x of t is our input. Right?
 

193
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,550
our output x of t is our input. Right?
And here we're uh thinking about this in

194
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
And here we're uh thinking about this in
 

195
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,829
And here we're uh thinking about this in
some sense as this input output view. So

196
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
some sense as this input output view. So
 

197
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,389
some sense as this input output view. So
let's say y of t has dy dimensions,

198
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
let's say y of t has dy dimensions,
 

199
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,509
let's say y of t has dy dimensions,
x of t has dx dimensions

200
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
x of t has dx dimensions
 

201
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,990
x of t has dx dimensions
and h of t has dh dimensions. Right? And

202
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
and h of t has dh dimensions. Right? And
 

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,350
and h of t has dh dimensions. Right? And
remember this dh is the thing that is

204
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
remember this dh is the thing that is
 

205
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,710
remember this dh is the thing that is
capturing all of the past. that is the

206
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:10,720
capturing all of the past. that is the
 

207
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,389
capturing all of the past. that is the
that is the uh our our memory or ability

208
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
that is the uh our our memory or ability
 

209
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,269
that is the uh our our memory or ability
to capture the history or the context of

210
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:17,279
to capture the history or the context of
 

211
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,110
to capture the history or the context of
our sequence is in in is is

212
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
our sequence is in in is is
 

213
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,070
our sequence is in in is is
related to how big this DH is. Okay, so

214
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
related to how big this DH is. Okay, so
 

215
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,750
related to how big this DH is. Okay, so
this is going to come up later when we

216
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
this is going to come up later when we
 

217
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,150
this is going to come up later when we
uh talk about a few things. So I just

218
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
uh talk about a few things. So I just
 

219
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,430
uh talk about a few things. So I just
want to highlight that.

220
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
want to highlight that.
 

221
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,389
want to highlight that.
So what are we going to do here? we have

222
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
So what are we going to do here? we have
 

223
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,190
So what are we going to do here? we have
this y of t

224
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
this y of t
 

225
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,070
this y of t
and I want to think about y of t on a

226
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
and I want to think about y of t on a
 

227
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,070
and I want to think about y of t on a
component by component basis right so

228
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
component by component basis right so
 

229
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,150
component by component basis right so
this is every dimension of my embedding

230
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
this is every dimension of my embedding
 

231
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,790
this is every dimension of my embedding
and so I'm going to write y of t as y of

232
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
and so I'm going to write y of t as y of
 

233
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,190
and so I'm going to write y of t as y of
t of1 y of t of two y of t of dy right y

234
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
t of1 y of t of two y of t of dy right y
 

235
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,230
t of1 y of t of two y of t of dy right y
of t is a vector

236
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
of t is a vector
 

237
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,790
of t is a vector
everyone with me there nothing nothing

238
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
everyone with me there nothing nothing
 

239
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,110
everyone with me there nothing nothing
has happened right

240
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
has happened right
 

241
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,430
has happened right
but what I want to do is now I want to

242
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
but what I want to do is now I want to
 

243
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,350
but what I want to do is now I want to
think about

244
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
think about
 

245
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,630
think about
Y as a

246
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
Y as a
 

247
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,350
Y as a
stack of sequences that are changing in

248
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
stack of sequences that are changing in
 

249
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,389
stack of sequences that are changing in
time. So I can think of Y as well. I

250
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
time. So I can think of Y as well. I
 

251
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,269
time. So I can think of Y as well. I
have the first component of Y and that

252
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
have the first component of Y and that
 

253
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,030
have the first component of Y and that
is a sequence that is evolving in time.

254
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
is a sequence that is evolving in time.
 

255
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,710
is a sequence that is evolving in time.
So I have the first component at time

256
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
So I have the first component at time
 

257
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,310
So I have the first component at time
one, the first component at time two,

258
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
one, the first component at time two,
 

259
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,829
one, the first component at time two,
the first component at time three and so

260
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
the first component at time three and so
 

261
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,990
the first component at time three and so
on and so forth. And then I can think of

262
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
on and so forth. And then I can think of
 

263
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,590
on and so forth. And then I can think of
the second component at time one and

264
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
the second component at time one and
 

265
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,110
the second component at time one and
time two and time three and time four

266
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
time two and time three and time four
 

267
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,790
time two and time three and time four
and so on. So instead of thinking of a

268
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
and so on. So instead of thinking of a
 

269
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,750
and so on. So instead of thinking of a
sequence of vectors, I can think of a

270
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
sequence of vectors, I can think of a
 

271
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,190
sequence of vectors, I can think of a
stack of sequences of scalers,

272
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
stack of sequences of scalers,
 

273
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,269
stack of sequences of scalers,
right? The kind of straightforward way

274
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
right? The kind of straightforward way
 

275
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,710
right? The kind of straightforward way
that I might want to break these things

276
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
that I might want to break these things
 

277
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,230
that I might want to break these things
up. So this I'm going to think of as a

278
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
up. So this I'm going to think of as a
 

279
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,030
up. So this I'm going to think of as a
sequence. Okay? And so for every

280
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
sequence. Okay? And so for every
 

281
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,150
sequence. Okay? And so for every
component of my input, I have a sequence

282
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
component of my input, I have a sequence
 

283
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,230
component of my input, I have a sequence
that is evolving.

284
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
that is evolving.
 

285
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,870
that is evolving.
For the kith component,

286
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
For the kith component,
 

287
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,110
For the kith component,
this is the sequence that I have. Any

288
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
this is the sequence that I have. Any
 

289
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,870
this is the sequence that I have. Any
questions about this?

290
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880

 

291
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,790

Good.

292
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
Good.
 

293
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,110
Good.
Okay.

294
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
Okay.
 

295
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,110
Okay.
And how many sequences such sequences do

296
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
And how many sequences such sequences do
 

297
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,389
And how many sequences such sequences do
I have? I have dy such sequences.

298
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
I have? I have dy such sequences.
 

299
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,069
I have? I have dy such sequences.
Okay.

300
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
Okay.
 

301
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,829
Okay.
And similarly, I can think of the same

302
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
And similarly, I can think of the same
 

303
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,790
And similarly, I can think of the same
thing for my input X, right? And for the

304
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
thing for my input X, right? And for the
 

305
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,550
thing for my input X, right? And for the
input X, how many sequences am I going

306
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
input X, how many sequences am I going
 

307
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,710
input X, how many sequences am I going
to have?

308
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
to have?
 

309
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,350
to have?
DX such sequences. Okay.

310
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360

 

311
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,269

So if I think about this y

312
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
So if I think about this y
 

313
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,509
So if I think about this y
tk. Okay,

314
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519

 

315
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,389

how do I compute this ytk? Well, ytk

316
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:40,399
how do I compute this ytk? Well, ytk
 

317
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,110
how do I compute this ytk? Well, ytk
is going to depend on basically

318
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
is going to depend on basically
 

319
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,710
is going to depend on basically
everything that has happened in the

320
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
everything that has happened in the
 

321
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,870
everything that has happened in the
past, right? So it depends on x11. It

322
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
past, right? So it depends on x11. It
 

323
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,870
past, right? So it depends on x11. It
depends on x21 depends on xt1 depends of

324
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880
depends on x21 depends on xt1 depends of
 

325
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,190
depends on x21 depends on xt1 depends of
first component all times of the first

326
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
first component all times of the first
 

327
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,670
first component all times of the first
component all times of the second

328
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
component all times of the second
 

329
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,310
component all times of the second
component and all times of the last

330
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
component and all times of the last
 

331
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,829
component and all times of the last
component up until time t. Right? We

332
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
component up until time t. Right? We
 

333
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,750
component up until time t. Right? We
have a causality restriction. So it can

334
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
have a causality restriction. So it can
 

335
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,030
have a causality restriction. So it can
never depend on t + one. But we have no

336
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
never depend on t + one. But we have no
 

337
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,710
never depend on t + one. But we have no
restriction that says that it can't

338
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
restriction that says that it can't
 

339
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,110
restriction that says that it can't
depend on other components.

340
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120

 

341
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,190

Okay.

342
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
Okay.
 

343
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,790
Okay.
So now I'm going to think of each of

344
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
So now I'm going to think of each of
 

345
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,710
So now I'm going to think of each of
these as these sequences

346
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
these as these sequences
 

347
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,269
these as these sequences
and my claim is

348
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
and my claim is
 

349
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,069
and my claim is
that I can actually write

350
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
that I can actually write
 

351
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,910
that I can actually write
this sequence yk. Okay. So which is the

352
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
this sequence yk. Okay. So which is the
 

353
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,710
this sequence yk. Okay. So which is the
sequence of the kith component.

354
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
sequence of the kith component.
 

355
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,190
sequence of the kith component.
So when I say sequence y k I mean that

356
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
So when I say sequence y k I mean that
 

357
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,509
So when I say sequence y k I mean that
sequence up there.

358
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
sequence up there.
 

359
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,030
sequence up there.
And I'm thinking of each of these as

360
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
And I'm thinking of each of these as
 

361
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,269
And I'm thinking of each of these as
sequence

362
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
sequence
 

363
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,190
sequence
sequences of X.

364
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200

 

365
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,310

And by having an appropriate filter

366
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
And by having an appropriate filter
 

367
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,350
And by having an appropriate filter
here, I can write this as a sum of

368
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
here, I can write this as a sum of
 

369
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,790
here, I can write this as a sum of
different convolutions. So I'm going to

370
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
different convolutions. So I'm going to
 

371
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,590
different convolutions. So I'm going to
take DX different convolutions

372
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
take DX different convolutions
 

373
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,030
take DX different convolutions
and I'm going to add them up to get my

374
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
and I'm going to add them up to get my
 

375
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,470
and I'm going to add them up to get my
sequence YK.

376
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:10,480
sequence YK.
 

377
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,430
sequence YK.
Okay. So this is not obvious how this is

378
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
Okay. So this is not obvious how this is
 

379
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,710
Okay. So this is not obvious how this is
happening, right? This is like a little

380
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
happening, right? This is like a little
 

381
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,949
happening, right? This is like a little
bit of like okay take this on a leap of

382
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:16,959
bit of like okay take this on a leap of
 

383
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,870
bit of like okay take this on a leap of
faith. So okay, first any questions

384
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
faith. So okay, first any questions
 

385
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,910
faith. So okay, first any questions
about this setup before I go forward?

386
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
about this setup before I go forward?
 

387
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,670
about this setup before I go forward?
There's a lot of indices moving here and

388
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
There's a lot of indices moving here and
 

389
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:43,110
There's a lot of indices moving here and
there. So yes, question.

390
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120

 

391
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,790

ah that is going to come through the

392
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:44,800
ah that is going to come through the
 

393
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,389
ah that is going to come through the
design of this filter. Yes.

394
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399

 

395
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,790

So we know basically we want to we want

396
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
So we know basically we want to we want
 

397
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,790
So we know basically we want to we want
to make sure through we know from our

398
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
to make sure through we know from our
 

399
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,189
to make sure through we know from our
linear system that we've set it up to be

400
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
linear system that we've set it up to be
 

401
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,030
linear system that we've set it up to be
causal, right?

402
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
causal, right?
 

403
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,069
causal, right?
So we're going to choose this filter to

404
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
So we're going to choose this filter to
 

405
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,150
So we're going to choose this filter to
be such that we'll just follow the

406
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
be such that we'll just follow the
 

407
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,750
be such that we'll just follow the
properties and I'm not even going to

408
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
properties and I'm not even going to
 

409
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,350
properties and I'm not even going to
actually derive exactly what this filter

410
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,360
actually derive exactly what this filter
 

411
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,910
actually derive exactly what this filter
is for you but you will see why what I'm

412
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
is for you but you will see why what I'm
 

413
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,150
is for you but you will see why what I'm
saying is true.

414
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160

 

415
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,750

So to understand this a little bit

416
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,760
So to understand this a little bit
 

417
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,829
So to understand this a little bit
better um I thought it would be very

418
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
better um I thought it would be very
 

419
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,310
better um I thought it would be very
good to go through an example

420
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:20,320
good to go through an example
 

421
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,310
good to go through an example
because what I want you to get is the

422
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
because what I want you to get is the
 

423
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,430
because what I want you to get is the
spirit of what is going on. So let's

424
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
spirit of what is going on. So let's
 

425
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,790
spirit of what is going on. So let's
consider this following system. Okay. So

426
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
consider this following system. Okay. So
 

427
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,470
consider this following system. Okay. So
I have h of t + 1 is

428
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
I have h of t + 1 is
 

429
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,910
I have h of t + 1 is
just this very simple diagonal matrix

430
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
just this very simple diagonal matrix
 

431
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,269
just this very simple diagonal matrix
time h of t plus

432
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
time h of t plus
 

433
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,069
time h of t plus
um just 1 1 0 1 * xt + 1. Let's say that

434
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
um just 1 1 0 1 * xt + 1. Let's say that
 

435
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,870
um just 1 1 0 1 * xt + 1. Let's say that
the initial state is zero. And let's say

436
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
the initial state is zero. And let's say
 

437
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,030
the initial state is zero. And let's say
your observations are being controlled

438
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,040
your observations are being controlled
 

439
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,189
your observations are being controlled
by this matrix or your outputs in this

440
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
by this matrix or your outputs in this
 

441
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,629
by this matrix or your outputs in this
case. Okay.

442
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639

 

443
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,150

So

444
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
So
 

445
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,030
So
take a minute look at this and write out

446
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
take a minute look at this and write out
 

447
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,470
take a minute look at this and write out
component by component how h is

448
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
component by component how h is
 

449
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,790
component by component how h is
evolving.

450
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
evolving.
 

451
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,389
evolving.
Okay, how is the first component

452
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
Okay, how is the first component
 

453
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,629
Okay, how is the first component
evolving? How is the second component

454
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
evolving? How is the second component
 

455
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,150
evolving? How is the second component
evolving?

456
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
evolving?
 

457
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,790
evolving?
And use this to see if you can

458
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
And use this to see if you can
 

459
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,790
And use this to see if you can
come to a conclusion like this. You can

460
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
come to a conclusion like this. You can
 

461
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,470
come to a conclusion like this. You can
see what these convolutions might end up

462
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
see what these convolutions might end up
 

463
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,829
see what these convolutions might end up
being.

464
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839

 

465
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,590

The best way to try to see this is to

466
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
The best way to try to see this is to
 

467
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,110
The best way to try to see this is to
just actually work out some algebra

468
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
just actually work out some algebra
 

469
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,829
just actually work out some algebra
yourself. So, take a minute and uh just

470
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:31,839
yourself. So, take a minute and uh just
 

471
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,590
yourself. So, take a minute and uh just
just play with the math for a few

472
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
just play with the math for a few
 

473
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,269
just play with the math for a few
minutes. If you have a question, feel

474
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
minutes. If you have a question, feel
 

475
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:45,110
minutes. If you have a question, feel
free to ask me. I'll give you some time.

476
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120

 

477
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,629

Is the question is what I'm asking you

478
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
Is the question is what I'm asking you
 

479
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,470
Is the question is what I'm asking you
to do clear to everyone or is there a

480
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
to do clear to everyone or is there a
 

481
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,310
to do clear to everyone or is there a
confusion?

482
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
confusion?
 

483
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,389
confusion?
everyone. I can't I can't I can't read

484
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
everyone. I can't I can't I can't read
 

485
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,230
everyone. I can't I can't I can't read
the room. Okay, I see a thumbs down.

486
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
the room. Okay, I see a thumbs down.
 

487
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,550
the room. Okay, I see a thumbs down.
Okay, someone want to ask me a question

488
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
Okay, someone want to ask me a question
 

489
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,110
Okay, someone want to ask me a question
or someone?

490
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,120
or someone?
 

491
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,310
or someone?
>> Sure. So, what I want you to see what

492
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
>> Sure. So, what I want you to see what
 

493
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,230
>> Sure. So, what I want you to see what
Okay, so here let's just step back.

494
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
Okay, so here let's just step back.
 

495
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,310
Okay, so here let's just step back.
Okay, what we want to do is we're

496
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
Okay, what we want to do is we're
 

497
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,749
Okay, what we want to do is we're
dealing with the fact that these things

498
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
dealing with the fact that these things
 

499
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,509
dealing with the fact that these things
are vectors.

500
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
are vectors.
 

501
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,269
are vectors.
We want to be able to use the fft tricks

502
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:13,279
We want to be able to use the fft tricks
 

503
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,670
We want to be able to use the fft tricks
to be able to

504
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
to be able to
 

505
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,230
to be able to
uh get to order t log t instead of order

506
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,240
uh get to order t log t instead of order
 

507
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,470
uh get to order t log t instead of order
t^2.

508
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,480
t^2.
 

509
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,790
t^2.
To do that, we have to somehow be able

510
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:22,800
To do that, we have to somehow be able
 

511
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,030
To do that, we have to somehow be able
to break our sequences of vectors into

512
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
to break our sequences of vectors into
 

513
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,230
to break our sequences of vectors into
sequences of scalers and convolutions of

514
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
sequences of scalers and convolutions of
 

515
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,470
sequences of scalers and convolutions of
sequences of scalers so that we can use

516
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
sequences of scalers so that we can use
 

517
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,749
sequences of scalers so that we can use
the FFT tricks.

518
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:35,759
the FFT tricks.
 

519
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,509
the FFT tricks.
And so what we're doing is I'm trying to

520
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
And so what we're doing is I'm trying to
 

521
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,509
And so what we're doing is I'm trying to
justify to you that this that this can

522
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:39,519
justify to you that this that this can
 

523
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,069
justify to you that this that this can
be done. Does that make sense? And so

524
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:42,079
be done. Does that make sense? And so
 

525
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,470
be done. Does that make sense? And so
for that what I'm asking you to do is

526
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
for that what I'm asking you to do is
 

527
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,710
for that what I'm asking you to do is
I'm saying it is really hard to see this

528
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
I'm saying it is really hard to see this
 

529
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,790
I'm saying it is really hard to see this
in like some symbolic notation with T's

530
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
in like some symbolic notation with T's
 

531
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,949
in like some symbolic notation with T's
and K's and L's and notation and indices

532
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
and K's and L's and notation and indices
 

533
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,670
and K's and L's and notation and indices
floating around. So I want you to try to

534
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
floating around. So I want you to try to
 

535
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,150
floating around. So I want you to try to
work this out for this example which is

536
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
work this out for this example which is
 

537
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,389
work this out for this example which is
you know engineered to be just simple

538
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
you know engineered to be just simple
 

539
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,150
you know engineered to be just simple
enough that the calculations aren't hard

540
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,160
enough that the calculations aren't hard
 

541
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,829
enough that the calculations aren't hard
but it'll illustrate what I'm trying to

542
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
but it'll illustrate what I'm trying to
 

543
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,429
but it'll illustrate what I'm trying to
say.

544
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
say.
 

545
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:39,590
say.
Everyone with me? Okay, great.

546
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:39,600

 

547
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,310

Um, you can set it up many different

548
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
Um, you can set it up many different
 

549
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,870
Um, you can set it up many different
ways. Here we're setting it up so that

550
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:46,880
ways. Here we're setting it up so that
 

551
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,710
ways. Here we're setting it up so that
>> it it really it doesn't matter. It's

552
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
>> it it really it doesn't matter. It's
 

553
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:57,270
>> it it really it doesn't matter. It's
just a convention issue.

554
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280

 

555
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,029

>> Oh, is there a bad handwriting issue?

556
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
>> Oh, is there a bad handwriting issue?
 

557
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:20,789
>> Oh, is there a bad handwriting issue?
>> Okay, tell me where. You're fine.

558
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:20,799

 

559
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,470

Okay, that's my timer. But I feel like

560
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
Okay, that's my timer. But I feel like
 

561
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,510
Okay, that's my timer. But I feel like
everyone's still working. Do you want

562
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
everyone's still working. Do you want
 

563
00:18:23,520 --> 00:19:51,190
everyone's still working. Do you want
another minute? Okay.

564
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200

 

565
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:59,029

[Music]

566
00:19:59,029 --> 00:19:59,039

 

567
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,710

Okay.

568
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
Okay.
 

569
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,350
Okay.
So, let's let's try to go through this

570
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,360
So, let's let's try to go through this
 

571
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,990
So, let's let's try to go through this
together. It's nothing complicated,

572
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,000
together. It's nothing complicated,
 

573
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,230
together. It's nothing complicated,
right? What I'm going to do is just

574
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,240
right? What I'm going to do is just
 

575
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,750
right? What I'm going to do is just
write this out step by step.

576
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:11,760
write this out step by step.
 

577
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,150
write this out step by step.
And so, if I look at the first component

578
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,160
And so, if I look at the first component
 

579
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,549
And so, if I look at the first component
of H now,

580
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
of H now,
 

581
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,029
of H now,
well, what is this? It's

582
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:19,039
well, what is this? It's
 

583
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,470
well, what is this? It's
just ht of one. I'm taking one times the

584
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480
just ht of one. I'm taking one times the
 

585
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,950
just ht of one. I'm taking one times the
first come on here.

586
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
first come on here.
 

587
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,990
first come on here.
Um,

588
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,000

 

589
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,590

wait, did I mess something up? Uh, no,

590
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,600
wait, did I mess something up? Uh, no,
 

591
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,830
wait, did I mess something up? Uh, no,
sorry. Uh,

592
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
sorry. Uh,
 

593
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,190
sorry. Uh,
yeah. No, sorry. This is correct. Uh,

594
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
yeah. No, sorry. This is correct. Uh,
 

595
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,630
yeah. No, sorry. This is correct. Uh,
yeah. Plus 0 times the second component,

596
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
yeah. Plus 0 times the second component,
 

597
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,470
yeah. Plus 0 times the second component,
right? So, one times the first component

598
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,480
right? So, one times the first component
 

599
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,549
right? So, one times the first component
plus 0 times the second component. So I

600
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
plus 0 times the second component. So I
 

601
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,710
plus 0 times the second component. So I
just have this here and then I look at

602
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
just have this here and then I look at
 

603
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,630
just have this here and then I look at
the input and so I have one times the

604
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
the input and so I have one times the
 

605
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,549
the input and so I have one times the
first component and then one times the

606
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:52,559
first component and then one times the
 

607
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,029
first component and then one times the
second component right that gives me

608
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:55,039
second component right that gives me
 

609
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,669
second component right that gives me
this equation here and so now if my

610
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:57,679
this equation here and so now if my
 

611
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,070
this equation here and so now if my
initial state is just zeros what I can

612
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,080
initial state is just zeros what I can
 

613
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,590
initial state is just zeros what I can
immediately see is what is this first

614
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
immediately see is what is this first
 

615
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,270
immediately see is what is this first
component doing it's just accumulating

616
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
component doing it's just accumulating
 

617
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,870
component doing it's just accumulating
all of the input right both the

618
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:06,880
all of the input right both the
 

619
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,230
all of the input right both the
components of the input it's taking the

620
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,240
components of the input it's taking the
 

621
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,110
components of the input it's taking the
two states um I shouldn't use the word

622
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
two states um I shouldn't use the word
 

623
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,110
two states um I shouldn't use the word
state it's taking the two components of

624
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,120
state it's taking the two components of
 

625
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,750
state it's taking the two components of
the input and summing them together and

626
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:15,760
the input and summing them together and
 

627
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,789
the input and summing them together and
accumulating this over time.

628
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799
accumulating this over time.
 

629
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,590
accumulating this over time.
Yeah, everyone see this?

630
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
Yeah, everyone see this?
 

631
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,789
Yeah, everyone see this?
It's this running sum. Okay,

632
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:24,799
It's this running sum. Okay,
 

633
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,430
It's this running sum. Okay,
now let's look at the second component.

634
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
now let's look at the second component.
 

635
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,190
now let's look at the second component.
Well, the second component here is alpha

636
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
Well, the second component here is alpha
 

637
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,870
Well, the second component here is alpha
times

638
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
times
 

639
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,149
times
ht of two. And now here there's a zero

640
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:36,159
ht of two. And now here there's a zero
 

641
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,029
ht of two. And now here there's a zero
one here. So this guy only really cares

642
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:39,039
one here. So this guy only really cares
 

643
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,750
one here. So this guy only really cares
about the second component of x, right?

644
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:43,760
about the second component of x, right?
 

645
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,710
about the second component of x, right?
So this is just This is like an

646
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
So this is just This is like an
 

647
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,230
So this is just This is like an
exponentially weighted average. Now

648
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
exponentially weighted average. Now
 

649
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,190
exponentially weighted average. Now
you've seen this kind of thing before.

650
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,200
you've seen this kind of thing before.
 

651
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,350
you've seen this kind of thing before.
So this is just this exponentially

652
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
So this is just this exponentially
 

653
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,870
So this is just this exponentially
weighted average of the second component

654
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
weighted average of the second component
 

655
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,870
weighted average of the second component
of the input. Okay.

656
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
of the input. Okay.
 

657
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,950
of the input. Okay.
And now adding this together, what do I

658
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:00,960
And now adding this together, what do I
 

659
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,870
And now adding this together, what do I
get on the output y? Well, the output is

660
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,880
get on the output y? Well, the output is
 

661
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,870
get on the output y? Well, the output is
half of the first state plus half of the

662
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880
half of the first state plus half of the
 

663
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,909
half of the first state plus half of the
second state. That's the first

664
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
second state. That's the first
 

665
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,149
second state. That's the first
component. So I have half ht of one plus

666
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
component. So I have half ht of one plus
 

667
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,710
component. So I have half ht of one plus
half ht of two. And so I get you know a

668
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
half ht of two. And so I get you know a
 

669
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,510
half ht of two. And so I get you know a
half times the first component in input

670
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
half times the first component in input
 

671
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,470
half times the first component in input
plus this kind of

672
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:20,480
plus this kind of
 

673
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,870
plus this kind of
one plus this exponential uh averaging

674
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
one plus this exponential uh averaging
 

675
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,950
one plus this exponential uh averaging
of the second component of the input.

676
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:26,960
of the second component of the input.
 

677
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,830
of the second component of the input.
Right? This is just algebra for what

678
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:29,840
Right? This is just algebra for what
 

679
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,549
Right? This is just algebra for what
these things turn out to be.

680
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:32,559
these things turn out to be.
 

681
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,950
these things turn out to be.
And then you know yt of two is much

682
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
And then you know yt of two is much
 

683
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,750
And then you know yt of two is much
simpler. There's no averaging here. I'm

684
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
simpler. There's no averaging here. I'm
 

685
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,149
simpler. There's no averaging here. I'm
just taking the second component of my

686
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
just taking the second component of my
 

687
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,230
just taking the second component of my
hidden state. And I know that that is

688
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
hidden state. And I know that that is
 

689
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,029
hidden state. And I know that that is
just the running sum of the second

690
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:45,039
just the running sum of the second
 

691
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,990
just the running sum of the second
component of my input.

692
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
component of my input.
 

693
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,070
component of my input.
Okay, everyone with me? So my point here

694
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
Okay, everyone with me? So my point here
 

695
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,669
Okay, everyone with me? So my point here
is not to illustrate the algebra. My

696
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
is not to illustrate the algebra. My
 

697
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,750
is not to illustrate the algebra. My
point is to illustrate why are these now

698
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:55,760
point is to illustrate why are these now
 

699
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,230
point is to illustrate why are these now
interpretable as convolutions. Right?

700
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
interpretable as convolutions. Right?
 

701
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,310
interpretable as convolutions. Right?
What I want to say is now I can think of

702
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320
What I want to say is now I can think of
 

703
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,510
What I want to say is now I can think of
see this is now what I have here is this

704
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,520
see this is now what I have here is this
 

705
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,070
see this is now what I have here is this
is some function of a time sequence of x

706
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
is some function of a time sequence of x
 

707
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,390
is some function of a time sequence of x
for a particular component. So this is

708
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
for a particular component. So this is
 

709
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,350
for a particular component. So this is
the sequence of x at the second

710
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
the sequence of x at the second
 

711
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,149
the sequence of x at the second
component of x. Right?

712
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:16,159
component of x. Right?
 

713
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,789
component of x. Right?
This is the sequence of x at the first

714
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
This is the sequence of x at the first
 

715
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,430
This is the sequence of x at the first
component of x.

716
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
component of x.
 

717
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,669
component of x.
So let's look at yt of two just because

718
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
So let's look at yt of two just because
 

719
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,390
So let's look at yt of two just because
that's easier. So yt of 2 is now just

720
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
that's easier. So yt of 2 is now just
 

721
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,950
that's easier. So yt of 2 is now just
this sum.

722
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:28,960
this sum.
 

723
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,950
this sum.
But instead of thinking of it as a sum,

724
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:30,960
But instead of thinking of it as a sum,
 

725
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,750
But instead of thinking of it as a sum,
I can think of it as one times

726
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
I can think of it as one times
 

727
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,510
I can think of it as one times
x i2.

728
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
x i2.
 

729
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,870
x i2.
Right? I can x i2 is just 1 * x i of2

730
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
Right? I can x i2 is just 1 * x i of2
 

731
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,990
Right? I can x i2 is just 1 * x i of2
and let's say x was some some sequence.

732
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
and let's say x was some some sequence.
 

733
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,909
and let's say x was some some sequence.
Let's say I just drew this out as some

734
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
Let's say I just drew this out as some
 

735
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,350
Let's say I just drew this out as some
example. So at zero it has this value

736
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
example. So at zero it has this value
 

737
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,110
example. So at zero it has this value
one it has this value so on and so

738
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,120
one it has this value so on and so
 

739
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,630
one it has this value so on and so
forth. What is the filter that I do the

740
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
forth. What is the filter that I do the
 

741
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,549
forth. What is the filter that I do the
convolution with to recover this running

742
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:00,559
convolution with to recover this running
 

743
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,549
convolution with to recover this running
sum?

744
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:02,559
sum?
 

745
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,230
sum?
Well, I'm going to have a filter that

746
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,240
Well, I'm going to have a filter that
 

747
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,350
Well, I'm going to have a filter that
basically only uses the past plus where

748
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
basically only uses the past plus where
 

749
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,230
basically only uses the past plus where
I currently am plus the present. So, it

750
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,240
I currently am plus the present. So, it
 

751
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,230
I currently am plus the present. So, it
has a tap at zero and then it has taps

752
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
has a tap at zero and then it has taps
 

753
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,789
has a tap at zero and then it has taps
at everywhere in the past.

754
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
at everywhere in the past.
 

755
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,070
at everywhere in the past.
And this filter when convolved with this

756
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,080
And this filter when convolved with this
 

757
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,310
And this filter when convolved with this
signal is going to give me exactly this

758
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
signal is going to give me exactly this
 

759
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,350
signal is going to give me exactly this
yt of two.

760
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360

 

761
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,950

This I'm just going to I can just

762
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
This I'm just going to I can just
 

763
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,630
This I'm just going to I can just
straight multiply this on. So then to

764
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:30,640
straight multiply this on. So then to
 

765
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,789
straight multiply this on. So then to
get yt of zero

766
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
get yt of zero
 

767
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,870
get yt of zero
I get only zero. Then I have two

768
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:34,880
I get only zero. Then I have two
 

769
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,310
I get only zero. Then I have two
overlapping and it's just the sum of

770
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320
overlapping and it's just the sum of
 

771
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,990
overlapping and it's just the sum of
these two. Then I have three overlapping

772
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,000
these two. Then I have three overlapping
 

773
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,149
these two. Then I have three overlapping
it's the sum of these three. So on and

774
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,159
it's the sum of these three. So on and
 

775
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,710
it's the sum of these three. So on and
so forth.

776
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,720
so forth.
 

777
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,190
so forth.
Everyone with me?

778
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,200
Everyone with me?
 

779
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,070
Everyone with me?
I feel like you're not with me. Lost.

780
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,080
I feel like you're not with me. Lost.
 

781
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,470
I feel like you're not with me. Lost.
Are you with me? Thumbs up. Thumbs down.

782
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:50,480
Are you with me? Thumbs up. Thumbs down.
 

783
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,590
Are you with me? Thumbs up. Thumbs down.
Okay, good. You're with me. Good.

784
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600
Okay, good. You're with me. Good.
 

785
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,990
Okay, good. You're with me. Good.
So this is just just to see very

786
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
So this is just just to see very
 

787
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,350
So this is just just to see very
explicitly now that I have taken a the

788
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,360
explicitly now that I have taken a the
 

789
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,269
explicitly now that I have taken a the
you know component by component of y and

790
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:01,279
you know component by component of y and
 

791
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,789
you know component by component of y and
now it is a sum of convolutions with

792
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799
now it is a sum of convolutions with
 

793
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,070
now it is a sum of convolutions with
the input sequence x. I can do the exact

794
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
the input sequence x. I can do the exact
 

795
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,669
the input sequence x. I can do the exact
same thing for the other component,

796
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
same thing for the other component,
 

797
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,310
same thing for the other component,
right? Yt of one. I can again separate

798
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
right? Yt of one. I can again separate
 

799
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,950
right? Yt of one. I can again separate
it out into

800
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
it out into
 

801
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,470
it out into
a convolution with the first component

802
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,480
a convolution with the first component
 

803
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,190
a convolution with the first component
sequence of X and a convolution with the

804
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,200
sequence of X and a convolution with the
 

805
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,269
sequence of X and a convolution with the
second component sequence of X.

806
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:29,279
second component sequence of X.
 

807
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,630
second component sequence of X.
Here I will just have now some

808
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
Here I will just have now some
 

809
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,789
Here I will just have now some
exponentially weighted taps for my

810
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
exponentially weighted taps for my
 

811
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,110
exponentially weighted taps for my
filter, but it's the same exact

812
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,120
filter, but it's the same exact
 

813
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,350
filter, but it's the same exact
principle. It's just a convolution.

814
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,360
principle. It's just a convolution.
 

815
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,909
principle. It's just a convolution.
Okay. And so for whatever I have, I can

816
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
Okay. And so for whatever I have, I can
 

817
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,830
Okay. And so for whatever I have, I can
always separate these out into

818
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
always separate these out into
 

819
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,029
always separate these out into
everything depends on the first

820
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
everything depends on the first
 

821
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,390
everything depends on the first
component, second component, third

822
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,400
component, second component, third
 

823
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,669
component, second component, third
component. It's always going to be

824
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:47,679
component. It's always going to be
 

825
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,269
component. It's always going to be
linear combinations. Therefore, I can

826
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
linear combinations. Therefore, I can
 

827
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,630
linear combinations. Therefore, I can
always make a filter that will be given

828
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:52,640
always make a filter that will be given
 

829
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,830
always make a filter that will be given
that will give me the appropriate

830
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:53,840
that will give me the appropriate
 

831
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,549
that will give me the appropriate
convolution which gives me this setup

832
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:56,559
convolution which gives me this setup
 

833
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,870
convolution which gives me this setup
here.

834
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
here.
 

835
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,630
here.
Does everyone see that? I'm not worried

836
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
Does everyone see that? I'm not worried
 

837
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,710
Does everyone see that? I'm not worried
too much about exactly what these FKL

838
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
too much about exactly what these FKL
 

839
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,470
too much about exactly what these FKL
are,

840
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
are,
 

841
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,269
are,
just the fact that I can compute them.

842
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:07,279
just the fact that I can compute them.
 

843
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,029
just the fact that I can compute them.
You had a question.

844
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:13,039

 

845
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,310

>> Yes.

846
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:18,320

 

847
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,789

>> There is.

848
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:24,799

 

849
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:37,590

>> Yeah.

850
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:37,600

 

851
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,510

Uh, did I miss a factor of alpha

852
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,520
Uh, did I miss a factor of alpha
 

853
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:54,630
Uh, did I miss a factor of alpha
somewhere?

854
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:54,640

 

855
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,149

here. There's Am I missing a factor of

856
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159
here. There's Am I missing a factor of
 

857
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:56,870
here. There's Am I missing a factor of
alpha here?

858
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
alpha here?
 

859
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,390
alpha here?
>> You just copied the

860
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,400
>> You just copied the
 

861
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,590
>> You just copied the
>> I copied something wrong.

862
00:26:59,590 --> 00:26:59,600
>> I copied something wrong.
 

863
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,830
>> I copied something wrong.
>> Yeah, forgot the t.

864
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
>> Yeah, forgot the t.
 

865
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,590
>> Yeah, forgot the t.
>> Oh,

866
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:05,600
>> Oh,
 

867
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,950
>> Oh,
where did I forget an alpha t minus one?

868
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:12,960

 

869
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:25,269

>> Here I forgot an alpha somewhere.

870
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:25,279

 

871
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,870

HT2 times alpha here.

872
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:28,880
HT2 times alpha here.
 

873
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,710
HT2 times alpha here.
>> No,

874
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720

 

875
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,350

>> I copied over HT2 wrong somehow.

876
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360

 

877
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,950

>> Ah, yeah. Okay, got it. Sorry.

878
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
>> Ah, yeah. Okay, got it. Sorry.
 

879
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,549
>> Ah, yeah. Okay, got it. Sorry.
Um,

880
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:48,559

 

881
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:55,590

so here I should have an alpha

882
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600

 

883
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:08,230

>> and here I should have an alpha.

884
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,240

 

885
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:16,950

>> Okay, I must have made an algebra error.

886
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960

 

887
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,470

Okay. Well, I'll figure this out. Sorry

888
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:18,480
Okay. Well, I'll figure this out. Sorry
 

889
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,230
Okay. Well, I'll figure this out. Sorry
if I if I lost your exponential. But

890
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
if I if I lost your exponential. But
 

891
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,149
if I if I lost your exponential. But
even if let's say I had an exponential

892
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:22,159
even if let's say I had an exponential
 

893
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,830
even if let's say I had an exponential
factor here, right? Let's say this was

894
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,840
factor here, right? Let's say this was
 

895
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,549
factor here, right? Let's say this was
not a one here. Let's say this was an

896
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
not a one here. Let's say this was an
 

897
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,870
not a one here. Let's say this was an
alpha t minus i. I'm not entirely sure

898
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:28,880
alpha t minus i. I'm not entirely sure
 

899
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,310
alpha t minus i. I'm not entirely sure
where I made the algebra error. I will

900
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,320
where I made the algebra error. I will
 

901
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,710
where I made the algebra error. I will
fix this, but it's just algebra. If this

902
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:32,720
fix this, but it's just algebra. If this
 

903
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,110
fix this, but it's just algebra. If this
was alpha t minus i, what would this

904
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
was alpha t minus i, what would this
 

905
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,950
was alpha t minus i, what would this
filter look like instead? This filter

906
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:36,960
filter look like instead? This filter
 

907
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,549
filter look like instead? This filter
would look like this. Like it would be a

908
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:42,559
would look like this. Like it would be a
 

909
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,510
would look like this. Like it would be a
decaying exponential of this form right

910
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:45,520
decaying exponential of this form right
 

911
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,070
decaying exponential of this form right
the the values of the filter I I'm sorry

the the values of the filter I I'm sorry
 

913
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,549
the the values of the filter I I'm sorry
I must have just lost a factor but uh is

minute just a bit for everyone. So now I

958
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
minute just a bit for everyone. So now I
 

959
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,110
minute just a bit for everyone. So now I
have broken this up into many many many

960
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,120
have broken this up into many many many
 

961
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,950
have broken this up into many many many
convolutions right and each of these is

962
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:54,960
convolutions right and each of these is
 

963
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,510
convolutions right and each of these is
capital T long and so I can have each of

964
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:57,520
capital T long and so I can have each of
 

965
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,909
capital T long and so I can have each of
these happen in order T log T time but I

966
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:01,919
these happen in order T log T time but I
 

967
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,789
these happen in order T log T time but I
have a ton of them right. In fact how

968
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
have a ton of them right. In fact how
 

969
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,470
have a ton of them right. In fact how
many do I have? Well, I have k times l

970
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
many do I have? Well, I have k times l
 

971
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,470
many do I have? Well, I have k times l
of them. Um, or I have dx times dy of

972
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480
of them. Um, or I have dx times dy of
 

973
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,149
of them. Um, or I have dx times dy of
them, right? So, I have dimension of x

974
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:14,159
them, right? So, I have dimension of x
 

975
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,190
them, right? So, I have dimension of x
times dimension of y. So, if each is 100

976
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:17,200
times dimension of y. So, if each is 100
 

977
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,110
times dimension of y. So, if each is 100
dimensions, that's 10 to the four.

978
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,120
dimensions, that's 10 to the four.
 

979
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,750
dimensions, that's 10 to the four.
That's a lot of convolutions.

980
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:21,760
That's a lot of convolutions.
 

981
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,710
That's a lot of convolutions.
Okay. So, this is this is exactly the

982
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:24,720
Okay. So, this is this is exactly the
 

983
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,630
Okay. So, this is this is exactly the
issue that we're basically going to try

984
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:26,640
issue that we're basically going to try
 

985
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,710
issue that we're basically going to try
and um handle next. Is is that exactly

986
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:30,720
and um handle next. Is is that exactly
 

987
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,750
and um handle next. Is is that exactly
what you're thinking about? Yeah. Okay.

988
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:33,760
what you're thinking about? Yeah. Okay.
 

989
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,230
what you're thinking about? Yeah. Okay.
So, good. So this is this is exactly

990
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
So, good. So this is this is exactly
 

991
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,549
So, good. So this is this is exactly
where I want to go. So we've solved a

992
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:38,559
where I want to go. So we've solved a
 

993
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,110
where I want to go. So we've solved a
part of it, but this is still a lot of

994
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,120
part of it, but this is still a lot of
 

995
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,870
part of it, but this is still a lot of
computation to do. Okay, 10,000

996
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:42,880
computation to do. Okay, 10,000
 

997
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,909
computation to do. Okay, 10,000
callutions is no joke.

998
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:47,919

 

999
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,789

Okay, so how are we going to Okay, I

1000
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
Okay, so how are we going to Okay, I
 

1001
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,830
Okay, so how are we going to Okay, I
actually wrote this here. Great. How do

1002
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:53,840
actually wrote this here. Great. How do
 

1003
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,630
actually wrote this here. Great. How do
we want to deal with this further? Okay,

1004
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:56,640
we want to deal with this further? Okay,
 

1005
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,789
we want to deal with this further? Okay,
well in connets, how did we how did we

1006
00:30:58,789 --> 00:30:58,799
well in connets, how did we how did we
 

1007
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,070
well in connets, how did we how did we
solve this problem? How did we think

1008
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,080
solve this problem? How did we think
 

1009
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,269
solve this problem? How did we think
about this problem? We said in a connet

1010
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:03,279
about this problem? We said in a connet
 

1011
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,870
about this problem? We said in a connet
we were we were we were having these

1012
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:04,880
we were we were we were having these
 

1013
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,870
we were we were we were having these
filters that were basically uh these

1014
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:06,880
filters that were basically uh these
 

1015
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,190
filters that were basically uh these
convolutions that were looking across

1016
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,200
convolutions that were looking across
 

1017
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,710
convolutions that were looking across
channels and across all of the

1018
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
channels and across all of the
 

1019
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,070
channels and across all of the
neighboring pixels and so on and so

1020
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,080
neighboring pixels and so on and so
 

1021
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,430
neighboring pixels and so on and so
forth. And we said well that's a lot of

1022
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:13,440
forth. And we said well that's a lot of
 

1023
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,909
forth. And we said well that's a lot of
work and what did we do to make it

1024
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:15,919
work and what did we do to make it
 

1025
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,029
work and what did we do to make it
easier on us. We said well let's not

1026
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:19,039
easier on us. We said well let's not
 

1027
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,630
easier on us. We said well let's not
combine across channels right and then

1028
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
combine across channels right and then
 

1029
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,590
combine across channels right and then
we did this depthwise convolution idea

1030
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
we did this depthwise convolution idea
 

1031
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,470
we did this depthwise convolution idea
or channel wise convolution. Well why

1032
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,480
or channel wise convolution. Well why
 

1033
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,269
or channel wise convolution. Well why
don't we just take the same idea? It

1034
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
don't we just take the same idea? It
 

1035
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,350
don't we just take the same idea? It
worked there. Let's see if we can make

1036
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,360
worked there. Let's see if we can make
 

1037
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,789
worked there. Let's see if we can make
it uh make it work here.

1038
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:36,799

 

1039
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,110

So if we wanted to make this work here,

1040
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,120
So if we wanted to make this work here,
 

1041
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,350
So if we wanted to make this work here,
what do we need to do? Remember, we've

1042
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
what do we need to do? Remember, we've
 

1043
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,990
what do we need to do? Remember, we've
already kind of committed to a being

1044
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,000
already kind of committed to a being
 

1045
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,669
already kind of committed to a being
diagonal.

1046
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:45,679
diagonal.
 

1047
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,509
diagonal.
Okay,

1048
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
Okay,
 

1049
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,389
Okay,
so what does it mean to now have the

1050
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:50,399
so what does it mean to now have the
 

1051
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,110
so what does it mean to now have the
different channels not really interact

1052
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,120
different channels not really interact
 

1053
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,789
different channels not really interact
with each other? what we want to have in

1054
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:54,799
with each other? what we want to have in
 

1055
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,110
with each other? what we want to have in
but the parallel to a depthwise or

1056
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,120
but the parallel to a depthwise or
 

1057
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,590
but the parallel to a depthwise or
channel-wise convolution is to say that

1058
00:31:59,590 --> 00:31:59,600
channel-wise convolution is to say that
 

1059
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,870
channel-wise convolution is to say that
every channel of the input just stays

1060
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
every channel of the input just stays
 

1061
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,389
every channel of the input just stays
like it doesn't mix with the other

1062
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:04,399
like it doesn't mix with the other
 

1063
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,870
like it doesn't mix with the other
channels in the SSM layer. It might mix

1064
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
channels in the SSM layer. It might mix
 

1065
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,549
channels in the SSM layer. It might mix
in the MLP layer that comes after it but

1066
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:12,559
in the MLP layer that comes after it but
 

1067
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,029
in the MLP layer that comes after it but
in the state space model we're going to

1068
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:15,039
in the state space model we're going to
 

1069
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,870
in the state space model we're going to
have each of the channels just do their

1070
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:16,880
have each of the channels just do their
 

1071
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,070
have each of the channels just do their
own thing. They're not going to mix with

1072
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,080
own thing. They're not going to mix with
 

1073
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,070
own thing. They're not going to mix with
each other.

1074
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,080
each other.
 

1075
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,710
each other.
Everyone understand the philosophy or

1076
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:22,720
Everyone understand the philosophy or
 

1077
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,590
Everyone understand the philosophy or
the spirit in that we're trying to

1078
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,600
the spirit in that we're trying to
 

1079
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,590
the spirit in that we're trying to
proceed with?

1080
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600
proceed with?
 

1081
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,430
proceed with?
So where are the places that these

1082
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:29,440
So where are the places that these
 

1083
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,710
So where are the places that these
different channels can mix with each

1084
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720
different channels can mix with each
 

1085
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,909
different channels can mix with each
other? Well, the A is already diagonal.

1086
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:33,919
other? Well, the A is already diagonal.
 

1087
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,630
other? Well, the A is already diagonal.
So now what about the B matrix, right?

1088
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
So now what about the B matrix, right?
 

1089
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,470
So now what about the B matrix, right?
That's the kind of big thing. So if I if

1090
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:38,480
That's the kind of big thing. So if I if
 

1091
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,149
That's the kind of big thing. So if I if
I can write out our equation here, we

1092
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
I can write out our equation here, we
 

1093
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,509
I can write out our equation here, we
have h of t + 1

1094
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:43,519
have h of t + 1
 

1095
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,350
have h of t + 1
is equal to a h of t

1096
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
is equal to a h of t
 

1097
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,190
is equal to a h of t
plus b

1098
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,200
plus b
 

1099
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,310
plus b
x of t.

1100
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
x of t.
 

1101
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,590
x of t.
And if I can think of x as this,

1102
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600
And if I can think of x as this,
 

1103
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,029
And if I can think of x as this,
it has these different components.

1104
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:01,039

 

1105
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,630

And if I want to make sure that these

1106
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
And if I want to make sure that these
 

1107
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,230
And if I want to make sure that these
don't mix with each other, what is the

1108
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
don't mix with each other, what is the
 

1109
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,669
don't mix with each other, what is the
structure that this is going to impose

1110
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:05,679
structure that this is going to impose
 

1111
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,830
structure that this is going to impose
on B?

1112
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:07,840
on B?
 

1113
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,710
on B?
It's going to be basically like

1114
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
It's going to be basically like
 

1115
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,029
It's going to be basically like
almost block diagonal in the sense that

1116
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:13,039
almost block diagonal in the sense that
 

1117
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,509
almost block diagonal in the sense that
it's going to have you know just I can

1118
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,519
it's going to have you know just I can
 

1119
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,909
it's going to have you know just I can
have this fan out to multiple hidden

1120
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:19,919
have this fan out to multiple hidden
 

1121
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,310
have this fan out to multiple hidden
states but I don't want these two things

1122
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,320
states but I don't want these two things
 

1123
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,470
states but I don't want these two things
to mix right so I'm going to have these

1124
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,480
to mix right so I'm going to have these
 

1125
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,509
to mix right so I'm going to have these
like columns so these going to be block

1126
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:27,519
like columns so these going to be block
 

1127
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,630
like columns so these going to be block
diagonal with these columns

1128
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640
diagonal with these columns
 

1129
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,710
diagonal with these columns
so that I can have one state or one

1130
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
so that I can have one state or one
 

1131
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,710
so that I can have one state or one
component of the input fan out to

1132
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:34,720
component of the input fan out to
 

1133
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,070
component of the input fan out to
multiple hidden states but none of them

1134
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,080
multiple hidden states but none of them
 

1135
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,230
multiple hidden states but none of them
are ever going to mix with each other.

1136
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,240
are ever going to mix with each other.
 

1137
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,909
are ever going to mix with each other.
Okay, that gives a and the same

1138
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:39,919
Okay, that gives a and the same
 

1139
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,669
Okay, that gives a and the same
structure is going to have to hold for C

1140
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
structure is going to have to hold for C
 

1141
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,190
structure is going to have to hold for C
if I want to have this this property

1142
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
if I want to have this this property
 

1143
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,350
if I want to have this this property
hold through all the way to the output.

1144
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,360
hold through all the way to the output.
 

1145
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,269
hold through all the way to the output.
Okay, so this gives us basically a uh

1146
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:51,279
Okay, so this gives us basically a uh
 

1147
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,389
Okay, so this gives us basically a uh
block diagonal type structure for B

1148
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:56,399

 

1149
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,590

and that basically helps us

1150
00:33:59,590 --> 00:33:59,600
and that basically helps us
 

1151
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,070
and that basically helps us
uh reduce some further computation. Yes,

1152
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,080
uh reduce some further computation. Yes,
 

1153
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,350
uh reduce some further computation. Yes,
question

1154
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,360
question
 

1155
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,269
question
>> just explain one more time why we're

1156
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:05,279
>> just explain one more time why we're
 

1157
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,950
>> just explain one more time why we're
doing this.

1158
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:06,960
doing this.
 

1159
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,790
doing this.
Why are we doing this depthwise con

1160
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:08,800
Why are we doing this depthwise con
 

1161
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,510
Why are we doing this depthwise con
convolution? Okay, great question. So

1162
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:13,520
convolution? Okay, great question. So
 

1163
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,510
convolution? Okay, great question. So
again, the name of the game is compute,

1164
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:15,520
again, the name of the game is compute,
 

1165
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,230
again, the name of the game is compute,
right? The if you can do it with less

1166
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,240
right? The if you can do it with less
 

1167
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,669
right? The if you can do it with less
compute, you're saving money, you're

1168
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
compute, you're saving money, you're
 

1169
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,829
compute, you're saving money, you're
doing better.

1170
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:21,839
doing better.
 

1171
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:27,109
doing better.
So if I split my my system, my big

1172
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
So if I split my my system, my big
 

1173
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,270
So if I split my my system, my big
convolution up into these many many

1174
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:29,280
convolution up into these many many
 

1175
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,869
convolution up into these many many
convolutions so that they can they're

1176
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:30,879
convolutions so that they can they're
 

1177
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,990
convolutions so that they can they're
all convolutions of scalar sequences.

1178
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,000
all convolutions of scalar sequences.
 

1179
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,510
all convolutions of scalar sequences.
That's great. But the I'm concerned also

1180
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:37,520
That's great. But the I'm concerned also
 

1181
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,869
That's great. But the I'm concerned also
not just about the length of the

1182
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:38,879
not just about the length of the
 

1183
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,270
not just about the length of the
sequences, right? I I can go from order

1184
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:41,280
sequences, right? I I can go from order
 

1185
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,669
sequences, right? I I can go from order
t^ squ to order t log t by splitting it

1186
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:43,679
t^ squ to order t log t by splitting it
 

1187
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,550
t^ squ to order t log t by splitting it
up into many convolutions.

1188
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:46,560
up into many convolutions.
 

1189
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,230
up into many convolutions.
But now the fact that I have many

1190
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,240
But now the fact that I have many
 

1191
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,190
But now the fact that I have many
convolutions, well, if I'm just doing

1192
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,200
convolutions, well, if I'm just doing
 

1193
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,510
convolutions, well, if I'm just doing
millions of convolutions,

1194
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:53,520
millions of convolutions,
 

1195
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,669
millions of convolutions,
even if every convolution is relatively

1196
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:55,679
even if every convolution is relatively
 

1197
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,990
even if every convolution is relatively
short, I'm still going to blow up in

1198
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,000
short, I'm still going to blow up in
 

1199
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,030
short, I'm still going to blow up in
time. So it would be nice to reduce the

1200
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,040
time. So it would be nice to reduce the
 

1201
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,550
time. So it would be nice to reduce the
total number of convolutions that I have

1202
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560
total number of convolutions that I have
 

1203
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,550
total number of convolutions that I have
to do.

1204
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:04,560
to do.
 

1205
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,510
to do.
And so instead of having 10,000

1206
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,520
And so instead of having 10,000
 

1207
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,190
And so instead of having 10,000
convolutions, which is what I would have

1208
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,200
convolutions, which is what I would have
 

1209
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,670
convolutions, which is what I would have
if I had to do

1210
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:11,680
if I had to do
 

1211
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,950
if I had to do
um dx * dy, if I had full generality on

1212
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:14,960
um dx * dy, if I had full generality on
 

1213
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,390
um dx * dy, if I had full generality on
this filter here,

1214
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,400
this filter here,
 

1215
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,990
this filter here,
how can I reduce the number of

1216
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,000
how can I reduce the number of
 

1217
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,589
how can I reduce the number of
convolutions?

1218
00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:21,599
convolutions?
 

1219
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,910
convolutions?
And so to do that, I want to set a bunch

1220
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:23,920
And so to do that, I want to set a bunch
 

1221
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,870
And so to do that, I want to set a bunch
of these filters just to be zero.

1222
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:26,880
of these filters just to be zero.
 

1223
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,190
of these filters just to be zero.
And one way to do that is to say that

1224
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200
And one way to do that is to say that
 

1225
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,390
And one way to do that is to say that
I'm going to set a bunch of the

1226
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:30,400
I'm going to set a bunch of the
 

1227
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,310
I'm going to set a bunch of the
coefficients B to zero.

1228
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:34,320
coefficients B to zero.
 

1229
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,910
coefficients B to zero.
One structured way to do that is to

1230
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:35,920
One structured way to do that is to
 

1231
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,270
One structured way to do that is to
follow exactly the path that we followed

1232
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,280
follow exactly the path that we followed
 

1233
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,990
follow exactly the path that we followed
for depthwise convolution where we had

1234
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,000
for depthwise convolution where we had
 

1235
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,750
for depthwise convolution where we had
that exact same problem and we reduce

1236
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:43,760
that exact same problem and we reduce
 

1237
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,670
that exact same problem and we reduce
the computation by saying we're not

1238
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:45,680
the computation by saying we're not
 

1239
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,910
the computation by saying we're not
going to mix across channels. Does that

1240
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:47,920
going to mix across channels. Does that
 

1241
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,270
going to mix across channels. Does that
make sense? Okay. Yes.

1242
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:51,280
make sense? Okay. Yes.
 

1243
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,109
make sense? Okay. Yes.
>> Is it a design restriction that we

1244
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:53,119
>> Is it a design restriction that we
 

1245
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,190

1246
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,200

00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,950
cannot have hidden dimensions?

1251
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,910
cannot have the hidden state be uh lower
dimensional? Yes. So here basically we

1252
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:03,920
dimensional? Yes. So here basically we
 

1253
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,270
dimensional? Yes. So here basically we
will we will maintain that the input and

1254
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
will we will maintain that the input and
 

1255
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,750
will we will maintain that the input and
output will be the same dimensions and

1256
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:09,760
output will be the same dimensions and
 

1257
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,750
output will be the same dimensions and
the hidden state can expand but it will

1258
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:11,760
the hidden state can expand but it will
 

1259
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,870
the hidden state can expand but it will
not reduce exactly and this is kind of

1260
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:14,880
not reduce exactly and this is kind of
 

1261
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,670
not reduce exactly and this is kind of
what we want right because we want we

1262
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:17,680
what we want right because we want we
 

1263
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,030
what we want right because we want we
want to actually and that's what we're

1264
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,040
want to actually and that's what we're
 

1265
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,310
want to actually and that's what we're
going to talk about next is we want to

1266
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:20,320
going to talk about next is we want to
 

1267
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,550
going to talk about next is we want to
make the dimension of h to be as large

1268
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
make the dimension of h to be as large
 

1269
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,870
make the dimension of h to be as large
as possible because that's where we're

1270
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:24,880
as possible because that's where we're
 

1271
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,589
as possible because that's where we're
holding all of our past. We want to be

1272
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:27,599
holding all of our past. We want to be
 

1273
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,430
holding all of our past. We want to be
able to use this recurrence to capture

1274
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:29,440
able to use this recurrence to capture
 

1275
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,829
able to use this recurrence to capture
the context or the or the history of our

1276
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:31,839
the context or the or the history of our
 

1277
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,430
the context or the or the history of our
sequence.

1278
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,440
sequence.
 

1279
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,589
sequence.
Uh so we're we're not opposed to making

1280
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:35,599
Uh so we're we're not opposed to making
 

1281
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:45,349
Uh so we're we're not opposed to making
it large.

1282
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:45,359

 

1283
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,230

Yes,

1284
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,240
Yes,
 

1285
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,829
Yes,
>> I'm a little confused like how do you

1286
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:47,839
>> I'm a little confused like how do you
 

1287
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,630
>> I'm a little confused like how do you
how do you like and

1288
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:52,640
how do you like and
 

1289
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,950
how do you like and
>> so uh A and B are learn matrices but you

1290
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:54,960
>> so uh A and B are learn matrices but you
 

1291
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,950
>> so uh A and B are learn matrices but you
can always force some parameters to be

1292
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:56,960
can always force some parameters to be
 

1293
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,910
can always force some parameters to be
something and just set them to zero.

1294
00:36:59,910 --> 00:36:59,920
something and just set them to zero.
 

1295
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,349
something and just set them to zero.
Don't pass any gradient through them.

1296
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:01,359
Don't pass any gradient through them.
 

1297
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,710
Don't pass any gradient through them.
Don't learn those parameters, right? You

1298
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:02,720
Don't learn those parameters, right? You
 

1299
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,150
Don't learn those parameters, right? You
can learn certain parameters and not

1300
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,160
can learn certain parameters and not
 

1301
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,910
can learn certain parameters and not
other parameters.

1302
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:05,920
other parameters.
 

1303
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,790
other parameters.
So for example, when a is diagonal,

1304
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:08,800
So for example, when a is diagonal,
 

1305
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,069
So for example, when a is diagonal,
we're just going to force a bunch of

1306
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:10,079
we're just going to force a bunch of
 

1307
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,750
we're just going to force a bunch of
things to be zeros. We're only going to

1308
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:11,760
things to be zeros. We're only going to
 

1309
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,150
things to be zeros. We're only going to
learn the diagonal elements.

1310
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160

 

1311
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,750

Great questions. Okay, good.

1312
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:21,760
Great questions. Okay, good.
 

1313
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,870
Great questions. Okay, good.
Okay, so these are all the different

1314
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
Okay, so these are all the different
 

1315
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,510
Okay, so these are all the different
things that we are are putting together

1316
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:27,520
things that we are are putting together
 

1317
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,109
things that we are are putting together
and we're building towards basically

1318
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:29,119
and we're building towards basically
 

1319
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,710
and we're building towards basically
this S4 model. Um so now I want to move

1320
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:34,720
this S4 model. Um so now I want to move
 

1321
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,630
this S4 model. Um so now I want to move
any questions on this part before I move

1322
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:36,640
any questions on this part before I move
 

1323
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:44,870
any questions on this part before I move
to like the next section. Okay.

1324
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:44,880

 

1325
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,790

Okay.

1326
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800

 

1327
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,270

So now this question was perfect because

1328
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:51,280
So now this question was perfect because
 

1329
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,150
So now this question was perfect because
we talked about well h the dimension of

1330
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,160
we talked about well h the dimension of
 

1331
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,630
we talked about well h the dimension of
h we always want to be larger than the

1332
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:56,640
h we always want to be larger than the
 

1333
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,470
h we always want to be larger than the
dimension of x and in some sense that's

1334
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:58,480
dimension of x and in some sense that's
 

1335
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,470
dimension of x and in some sense that's
a design decision

1336
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:00,480
a design decision
 

1337
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,910
a design decision
but the dimension of h is in some sense

1338
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:03,920
but the dimension of h is in some sense
 

1339
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,430
but the dimension of h is in some sense
one of the critical parameters for our

1340
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,440
one of the critical parameters for our
 

1341
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,670
one of the critical parameters for our
whole setup because that captures what

1342
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:09,680
whole setup because that captures what
 

1343
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,349
whole setup because that captures what
we can we can u handle but there's a

1344
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:13,359
we can we can u handle but there's a
 

1345
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,630
we can we can u handle but there's a
fundamental trade-off here right if we

1346
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:16,640
fundamental trade-off here right if we
 

1347
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,950
fundamental trade-off here right if we
make h bigger and bigger and bigger

1348
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
make h bigger and bigger and bigger
 

1349
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,990
make h bigger and bigger and bigger
That means more and more compute, but it

1350
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,000
That means more and more compute, but it
 

1351
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,710
That means more and more compute, but it
also means we can store more and more

1352
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
also means we can store more and more
 

1353
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,990
also means we can store more and more
stuff about our past. So there's an

1354
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,000
stuff about our past. So there's an
 

1355
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,630
stuff about our past. So there's an
efficiency versus efficacy trade-off,

1356
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:30,640
efficiency versus efficacy trade-off,
 

1357
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,390
efficiency versus efficacy trade-off,
right? To be efficient, I want age to be

1358
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,400
right? To be efficient, I want age to be
 

1359
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,270
right? To be efficient, I want age to be
small, but to be effective, I want to

1360
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,280
small, but to be effective, I want to
 

1361
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,349
small, but to be effective, I want to
remember as much of the history and as

1362
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:37,359
remember as much of the history and as
 

1363
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,910
remember as much of the history and as
much of the past as I can.

1364
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:39,920
much of the past as I can.
 

1365
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,670
much of the past as I can.
So what I want is actually want to like

1366
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:41,680
So what I want is actually want to like
 

1367
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,589
So what I want is actually want to like
I want to have a sweet spot somehow

1368
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:43,599
I want to have a sweet spot somehow
 

1369
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,349
I want to have a sweet spot somehow
where H is as large as it can possibly

1370
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:47,359
where H is as large as it can possibly
 

1371
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,630
where H is as large as it can possibly
be. But you know I want to make sure

1372
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:48,640
be. But you know I want to make sure
 

1373
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,870
be. But you know I want to make sure
that my compute is still while still

1374
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:50,880
that my compute is still while still
 

1375
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,270
that my compute is still while still
minimizing my compute.

1376
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:53,280
minimizing my compute.
 

1377
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,790
minimizing my compute.
Okay.

1378
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:54,800
Okay.
 

1379
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,870
Okay.
So now

1380
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:56,880
So now
 

1381
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,710
So now
this is the key thing that kind of the

1382
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:00,720
this is the key thing that kind of the
 

1383
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,150
this is the key thing that kind of the
family of state space models are are are

1384
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,160
family of state space models are are are
 

1385
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,630
family of state space models are are are
working towards. And this first model

1386
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:06,640
working towards. And this first model
 

1387
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,310
working towards. And this first model
that I'm currently talking about that we

1388
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,320
that I'm currently talking about that we
 

1389
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,510
that I'm currently talking about that we
talked about last time and I'm going to

1390
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:09,520
talked about last time and I'm going to
 

1391
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,790
talked about last time and I'm going to
talk about for the first part of this

1392
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:10,800
talk about for the first part of this
 

1393
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,510
talk about for the first part of this
lecture is the S4 model. Okay.

1394
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:13,520
lecture is the S4 model. Okay.
 

1395
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,589
lecture is the S4 model. Okay.
I think it's for

1396
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:15,599
I think it's for
 

1397
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,270
I think it's for
structured

1398
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,280
structured
 

1399
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,270
structured
state space. That's three of the S's and

1400
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,280
state space. That's three of the S's and
 

1401
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,790
state space. That's three of the S's and
there's another S. Do you remember what

1402
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:20,800
there's another S. Do you remember what
 

1403
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,710
there's another S. Do you remember what
the other S is? No, but there's four

1404
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:22,720
the other S is? No, but there's four
 

1405
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,109
the other S is? No, but there's four
S's.

1406
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:25,119
S's.
 

1407
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,630
S's.
Um, and then the one that comes after

1408
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
Um, and then the one that comes after
 

1409
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,790
Um, and then the one that comes after
that is

1410
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:28,800
that is
 

1411
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,390
that is
S6 because it's

1412
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,400
S6 because it's
 

1413
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,109
S6 because it's
structured selective

1414
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:35,119
structured selective
 

1415
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,950
structured selective
state space. Okay, there's more S's, but

1416
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:36,960
state space. Okay, there's more S's, but
 

1417
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,390
state space. Okay, there's more S's, but
you can you can remember what the SS

1418
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:38,400
you can you can remember what the SS
 

1419
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,670
you can you can remember what the SS
are, but there's four S's and then

1420
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:39,680
are, but there's four S's and then
 

1421
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,069
are, but there's four S's and then
there's six S's. um we're talking about

1422
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:42,079
there's six S's. um we're talking about
 

1423
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,829
there's six S's. um we're talking about
the one with the four S's and I know one

1424
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
the one with the four S's and I know one
 

1425
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,270
the one with the four S's and I know one
of them is structured state space I'm

1426
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,280
of them is structured state space I'm
 

1427
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,270
of them is structured state space I'm
just forgetting what the fourth one is

1428
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:49,280
just forgetting what the fourth one is
 

1429
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,510
just forgetting what the fourth one is
so now can we think about the other part

1430
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:51,520
so now can we think about the other part
 

1431
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,589
so now can we think about the other part
that we're so for this S4 model can we

1432
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:53,599
that we're so for this S4 model can we
 

1433
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,870
that we're so for this S4 model can we
think about the long range dependency

1434
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:56,880
think about the long range dependency
 

1435
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,550
think about the long range dependency
that we want to engineer right we've

1436
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
that we want to engineer right we've
 

1437
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,030
that we want to engineer right we've
talked about the parallelization we've

1438
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,040
talked about the parallelization we've
 

1439
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,710
talked about the parallelization we've
talked about getting this to train

1440
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:02,720
talked about getting this to train
 

1441
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,109
talked about getting this to train
efficiently right that part we've kind

1442
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:05,119
efficiently right that part we've kind
 

1443
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,670
efficiently right that part we've kind
of we've wrapped up a little bit that

1444
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:07,680
of we've wrapped up a little bit that
 

1445
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,150
of we've wrapped up a little bit that
part what I want to move to next is the

1446
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,160
part what I want to move to next is the
 

1447
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,430
part what I want to move to next is the
other thing that we talked talked about

1448
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:11,440
other thing that we talked talked about
 

1449
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,430
other thing that we talked talked about
which is

1450
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,440
which is
 

1451
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,910
which is
how do we make sure that we can remember

1452
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:15,920
how do we make sure that we can remember
 

1453
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,510
how do we make sure that we can remember
our history and we don't run into the

1454
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:17,520
our history and we don't run into the
 

1455
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,710
our history and we don't run into the
RNN problem of just the past dying away

1456
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:20,720
RNN problem of just the past dying away
 

1457
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,470
RNN problem of just the past dying away
too quickly.

1458
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,480
too quickly.
 

1459
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,990
too quickly.
Everyone with me on what we're trying to

1460
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,000
Everyone with me on what we're trying to
 

1461
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,069
Everyone with me on what we're trying to
do? Okay.

1462
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:28,079
do? Okay.
 

1463
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,630
do? Okay.
So our A is this diagonal thing

1464
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:32,640
So our A is this diagonal thing
 

1465
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,630
So our A is this diagonal thing
and we have these igen values. We're a

1466
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:34,640
and we have these igen values. We're a
 

1467
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,349
and we have these igen values. We're a
discrete time system at the moment.

1468
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:37,359
discrete time system at the moment.
 

1469
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,510
discrete time system at the moment.
So what can we say about these igen

1470
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520
So what can we say about these igen
 

1471
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,390
So what can we say about these igen
values in terms of what we want and what

1472
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:42,400
values in terms of what we want and what
 

1473
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,670
values in terms of what we want and what
we don't want? Right? We're going to

1474
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
we don't want? Right? We're going to
 

1475
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,310
we don't want? Right? We're going to
learn them. But are there desirable

1476
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:46,320
learn them. But are there desirable
 

1477
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,349
learn them. But are there desirable
properties and undesirable properties

1478
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:51,359

 

1479
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,990

just for a system? Let's say I take a we

1480
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,000
just for a system? Let's say I take a we
 

1481
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,550
just for a system? Let's say I take a we
take a dynamical system. What kind of

1482
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:56,560
take a dynamical system. What kind of
 

1483
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,710
take a dynamical system. What kind of
A's are good for system stability and

1484
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:58,720
A's are good for system stability and
 

1485
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,630
A's are good for system stability and
what kind of A's are bad for system

1486
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:00,640
what kind of A's are bad for system
 

1487
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,230
what kind of A's are bad for system
stability?

1488
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,240

 

1489
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,990

>> Yeah. absolute value.

1490
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,000

 

1491
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,950

So if I have absolute value, so the

1492
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
So if I have absolute value, so the
 

1493
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,550
So if I have absolute value, so the
absolute value of the igen value is what

1494
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:14,560
absolute value of the igen value is what
 

1495
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,109
absolute value of the igen value is what
matters. And so if the absolute value of

1496
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
matters. And so if the absolute value of
 

1497
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,910
matters. And so if the absolute value of
the igen value, if it was bigger than

1498
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
the igen value, if it was bigger than
 

1499
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,589
the igen value, if it was bigger than
one,

1500
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:21,599
one,
 

1501
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,870
one,
what would this mean for the

1502
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:22,880
what would this mean for the
 

1503
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,750
what would this mean for the
corresponding state? Right? We do we

1504
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:25,760
corresponding state? Right? We do we
 

1505
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,550
corresponding state? Right? We do we
want this to happen? This is really bad,

1506
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:28,560
want this to happen? This is really bad,
 

1507
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,750
want this to happen? This is really bad,
right? Because if you if you have a

1508
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:29,760
right? Because if you if you have a
 

1509
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,349
right? Because if you if you have a
system and your igen values are bigger

1510
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:31,359
system and your igen values are bigger
 

1511
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,030
system and your igen values are bigger
than one, then you're just blowing up

1512
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,040
than one, then you're just blowing up
 

1513
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,550
than one, then you're just blowing up
blowing up. You're going to run out of

1514
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:34,560
blowing up. You're going to run out of
 

1515
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,870
blowing up. You're going to run out of
floating point very fast, right? So this

1516
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:36,880
floating point very fast, right? So this
 

1517
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,390
floating point very fast, right? So this
is bad. You do not want to end up in

1518
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,400
is bad. You do not want to end up in
 

1519
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,870
is bad. You do not want to end up in
this regime. So here your system

1520
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:40,880
this regime. So here your system
 

1521
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,510
this regime. So here your system
explodes

1522
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:45,520

 

1523
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,390

and this is bad.

1524
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,400
and this is bad.
 

1525
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,430
and this is bad.
Okay.

1526
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:51,440

 

1527
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,950

So the other side is that when all of

1528
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:54,960
So the other side is that when all of
 

1529
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,510
So the other side is that when all of
your igen values are less than one and

1530
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:57,520
your igen values are less than one and
 

1531
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,109
your igen values are less than one and
what happens when your igen values are

1532
00:41:59,109 --> 00:41:59,119
what happens when your igen values are
 

1533
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,390
what happens when your igen values are
less than one?

1534
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
less than one?
 

1535
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,230
less than one?
You're going to slowly decay away to

1536
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,240
You're going to slowly decay away to
 

1537
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,390
You're going to slowly decay away to
zero. You're not going to explode. So

1538
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,400
zero. You're not going to explode. So
 

1539
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,950
zero. You're not going to explode. So
that's very good. But this is kind of

1540
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:08,960
that's very good. But this is kind of
 

1541
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,670
that's very good. But this is kind of
the same issue that we had with RNNS,

1542
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:11,680
the same issue that we had with RNNS,
 

1543
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,190
the same issue that we had with RNNS,
right? That you have this decaying

1544
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:13,200
right? That you have this decaying
 

1545
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,430
right? That you have this decaying
weight on the history.

1546
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:15,440
weight on the history.
 

1547
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,670
weight on the history.
And so

1548
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:17,680
And so
 

1549
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,510
And so
yeah, it's there, but it might just die

1550
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:19,520
yeah, it's there, but it might just die
 

1551
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,109
yeah, it's there, but it might just die
away very fast. You're doing all of

1552
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:21,119
away very fast. You're doing all of
 

1553
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,589
away very fast. You're doing all of
this, you know, state computation blah

1554
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:23,599
this, you know, state computation blah
 

1555
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:24,710
this, you know, state computation blah
blah blah, but you're just setting

1556
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
blah blah, but you're just setting
 

1557
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,470
blah blah, but you're just setting
everything in the past to zero very

1558
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,480
everything in the past to zero very
 

1559
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,150
everything in the past to zero very
quickly. So this is also not that great,

1560
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,160
quickly. So this is also not that great,
 

1561
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,589
quickly. So this is also not that great,
right? You know, the history might die

1562
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:31,599
right? You know, the history might die
 

1563
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:38,150
right? You know, the history might die
out fast.

1564
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:38,160

 

1565
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,270

So what's the sweet spot?

1566
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:43,280

 

1567
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,349

What if lambda is exactly equal to one?

1568
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:45,359
What if lambda is exactly equal to one?
 

1569
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,030
What if lambda is exactly equal to one?
What is the the what if the absolute

1570
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,040
What is the the what if the absolute
 

1571
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,150
What is the the what if the absolute
value of lambda is exactly equal to one?

1572
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,160
value of lambda is exactly equal to one?
 

1573
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:57,670
value of lambda is exactly equal to one?
This in control systems is basically

1574
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:57,680

 

1575
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,390

critical damping. Right? So you have you

1576
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:00,400
critical damping. Right? So you have you
 

1577
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,309
critical damping. Right? So you have you
have the system state is maintained

1578
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:04,319
have the system state is maintained
 

1579
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,270
have the system state is maintained
but it's not exploding and it's not

1580
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:07,280
but it's not exploding and it's not
 

1581
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,990
but it's not exploding and it's not
dying out but it's somehow just moving

1582
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,000
dying out but it's somehow just moving
 

1583
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,589
dying out but it's somehow just moving
around without changes in magnitude

1584
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:13,599
around without changes in magnitude
 

1585
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,829
around without changes in magnitude
right it could have changes in direction

1586
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
right it could have changes in direction
 

1587
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,550
right it could have changes in direction
but it doesn't have changes in magnitude

1588
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:20,560

 

1589
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,309

so are you happy about this or sad about

1590
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:22,319
so are you happy about this or sad about
 

1591
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,550
so are you happy about this or sad about
this

1592
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:26,560

 

1593
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,309

pros and cons to this Right?

1594
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:32,319

 

1595
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,150

Let's say our igen values were all real

1596
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,160
Let's say our igen values were all real
 

1597
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,990
Let's say our igen values were all real
valued. What are the choices that we

1598
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,000
valued. What are the choices that we
 

1599
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,069
valued. What are the choices that we
have in this case? If we wanted to just

1600
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:38,079
have in this case? If we wanted to just
 

1601
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,710
have in this case? If we wanted to just
set our system to be

1602
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:42,720

 

1603
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,870

we have two choices, right? We have

1604
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:44,880
we have two choices, right? We have
 

1605
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,790
we have two choices, right? We have
lambda is plus one and we have lambda is

1606
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:48,800
lambda is plus one and we have lambda is
 

1607
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,349
lambda is plus one and we have lambda is
minus one. That's not a lot of choices.

1608
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:51,359
minus one. That's not a lot of choices.
 

1609
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,030
minus one. That's not a lot of choices.
It's pretty there's there's only these

1610
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,040
It's pretty there's there's only these
 

1611
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,190
It's pretty there's there's only these
two choices.

1612
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:55,200
two choices.
 

1613
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,230
two choices.
And the other thing about these is that

1614
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:58,240
And the other thing about these is that
 

1615
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,910
And the other thing about these is that
they're not really friendly for gradient

1616
00:43:59,910 --> 00:43:59,920
they're not really friendly for gradient
 

1617
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,230
they're not really friendly for gradient
descent. They're far apart from each

1618
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:02,240
descent. They're far apart from each
 

1619
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,150
descent. They're far apart from each
other, right? So if you initialized at

1620
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,160
other, right? So if you initialized at
 

1621
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,470
other, right? So if you initialized at
the wrong one, like gradient descent

1622
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,480
the wrong one, like gradient descent
 

1623
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,750
the wrong one, like gradient descent
might not even take you to the other

1624
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:07,760
might not even take you to the other
 

1625
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,230
might not even take you to the other
one.

1626
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:10,240
one.
 

1627
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,390
one.
So what what do you do? What can you do

1628
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:12,400
So what what do you do? What can you do
 

1629
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,270
So what what do you do? What can you do
here? What is the next thing that you

1630
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:15,280
here? What is the next thing that you
 

1631
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:26,069
here? What is the next thing that you
try?

1632
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:26,079

 

1633
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,750

go to complex, right? You say, well,

1634
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:29,760
go to complex, right? You say, well,
 

1635
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,230
go to complex, right? You say, well,
I might not like complex numbers, but

1636
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
I might not like complex numbers, but
 

1637
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,510
I might not like complex numbers, but
you're going to bite the bullet and

1638
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:33,520
you're going to bite the bullet and
 

1639
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,670
you're going to bite the bullet and
you're going to go to complex values.

1640
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:35,680
you're going to go to complex values.
 

1641
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,309
you're going to go to complex values.
So, how do you let's maybe let's yeah,

1642
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:38,319
So, how do you let's maybe let's yeah,
 

1643
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,750
So, how do you let's maybe let's yeah,
what might be a way in which we can

1644
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:39,760
what might be a way in which we can
 

1645
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,910
what might be a way in which we can
think about initializing complex values

1646
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
think about initializing complex values
 

1647
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,349
think about initializing complex values
here? What's a what's a good way to

1648
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:43,359
here? What's a what's a good way to
 

1649
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,510
here? What's a what's a good way to
think about how to how to have complex

1650
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
think about how to how to have complex
 

1651
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,950
think about how to how to have complex
values?

1652
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:52,960

 

1653
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,230

Let me see. Maybe uh

1654
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:56,240
Let me see. Maybe uh
 

1655
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,069
Let me see. Maybe uh
I might want the time at the end. So I

1656
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:58,079
I might want the time at the end. So I
 

1657
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,829
I might want the time at the end. So I
will give this part away. But

1658
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:01,839
will give this part away. But
 

1659
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,430
will give this part away. But
so what I'm going to think about is I'm

1660
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:03,440
so what I'm going to think about is I'm
 

1661
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,510
so what I'm going to think about is I'm
going to think about these lambdas as

1662
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:07,520
going to think about these lambdas as
 

1663
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,430
going to think about these lambdas as
having a real part and an imaginary

1664
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:11,440
having a real part and an imaginary
 

1665
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,829
having a real part and an imaginary
part. And I want to now make sure

1666
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
part. And I want to now make sure
 

1667
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,510
part. And I want to now make sure
what do I want to make sure what what do

1668
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
what do I want to make sure what what do
 

1669
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,710
what do I want to make sure what what do
I want to have be true about the real

1670
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:20,720
I want to have be true about the real
 

1671
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,270
I want to have be true about the real
part of my igen values? what is good and

1672
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:23,280
part of my igen values? what is good and
 

1673
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,710
part of my igen values? what is good and
what is bad.

1674
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:26,720

 

1675
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,550

If it's I want it to be negative, right?

1676
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560
If it's I want it to be negative, right?
 

1677
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,829
If it's I want it to be negative, right?
I don't want it to be positive,

1678
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:29,839
I don't want it to be positive,
 

1679
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,670
I don't want it to be positive,
otherwise things are going to blow up on

1680
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,680
otherwise things are going to blow up on
 

1681
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,190
otherwise things are going to blow up on
me. So, what's a way that I have of kind

1682
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,200
me. So, what's a way that I have of kind
 

1683
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,630
me. So, what's a way that I have of kind
of making sure that things are negative

1684
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:36,640
of making sure that things are negative
 

1685
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,109
of making sure that things are negative
or positive or checking the sign? Well,

1686
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:39,119
or positive or checking the sign? Well,
 

1687
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,109
or positive or checking the sign? Well,
I have a nonlinear in my linearity in my

1688
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:41,119
I have a nonlinear in my linearity in my
 

1689
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,309
I have a nonlinear in my linearity in my
pocket that basically does this for me,

1690
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
pocket that basically does this for me,
 

1691
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,750
pocket that basically does this for me,
right? So I can basically put

1692
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:47,760
right? So I can basically put
 

1693
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,950
right? So I can basically put
a relu on this here and put a minus sign

1694
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:50,960
a relu on this here and put a minus sign
 

1695
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,589
a relu on this here and put a minus sign
and that ensures that this is always a

1696
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:55,599
and that ensures that this is always a
 

1697
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,510
and that ensures that this is always a
uh always negative and then I can have

1698
00:45:59,510 --> 00:45:59,520
uh always negative and then I can have
 

1699
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,309
uh always negative and then I can have
my igen values be captured by this.

1700
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:02,319
my igen values be captured by this.
 

1701
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,230
my igen values be captured by this.
Okay. And this will give me something

1702
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:04,240
Okay. And this will give me something
 

1703
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,710
Okay. And this will give me something
that that kind of works pretty well

1704
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:06,720
that that kind of works pretty well
 

1705
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,870
that that kind of works pretty well
here. I'm thinking of uh J as the uh

1706
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:10,880
here. I'm thinking of uh J as the uh
 

1707
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,510
here. I'm thinking of uh J as the uh
negative root of uh uh as the root of

1708
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:13,520
negative root of uh uh as the root of
 

1709
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,870
negative root of uh uh as the root of
minus one. Okay. And so this is the

1710
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:16,880
minus one. Okay. And so this is the
 

1711
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,950
minus one. Okay. And so this is the
parameterization that I will use to

1712
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
parameterization that I will use to
 

1713
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,390
parameterization that I will use to
actually learn the igen values for a. It

1714
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:22,400
actually learn the igen values for a. It
 

1715
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,670
actually learn the igen values for a. It
turns out that it's pretty sensitive to

1716
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:25,680
turns out that it's pretty sensitive to
 

1717
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,309
turns out that it's pretty sensitive to
figure this to this parameterization and

1718
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
figure this to this parameterization and
 

1719
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,390
figure this to this parameterization and
exactly the initialization that you will

1720
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:30,400
exactly the initialization that you will
 

1721
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,190
exactly the initialization that you will
use to learn these parameters.

1722
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,200
use to learn these parameters.
 

1723
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,910
use to learn these parameters.
So you have to kind of set up your

1724
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:35,920
So you have to kind of set up your
 

1725
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,349
So you have to kind of set up your
system so that your igen values are

1726
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:39,359
system so that your igen values are
 

1727
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,870
system so that your igen values are
largely very close to the unit circle

1728
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
largely very close to the unit circle
 

1729
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,349
largely very close to the unit circle
and other ones are inside. Like if you

1730
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:45,359
and other ones are inside. Like if you
 

1731
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:46,550
and other ones are inside. Like if you
have some IGEN values in your

1732
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:46,560
have some IGEN values in your
 

1733
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,309
have some IGEN values in your
initialization that end up outside the

1734
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:48,319
initialization that end up outside the
 

1735
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,630
initialization that end up outside the
unit circle, you're prone to instability

1736
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:50,640
unit circle, you're prone to instability
 

1737
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,710
unit circle, you're prone to instability
and that's not very good. So uh there's

1738
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:54,720
and that's not very good. So uh there's
 

1739
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,270
and that's not very good. So uh there's
basically tricks that you can do to get

1740
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
basically tricks that you can do to get
 

1741
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,030
basically tricks that you can do to get
this initialization. I'm not going to go

1742
00:46:59,030 --> 00:46:59,040
this initialization. I'm not going to go
 

1743
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,390
this initialization. I'm not going to go
into those uh right now, but I talked

1744
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:02,400
into those uh right now, but I talked
 

1745
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,390
into those uh right now, but I talked
about this hippo paper last time that

1746
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:04,400
about this hippo paper last time that
 

1747
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,349
about this hippo paper last time that
talked about that that that was the

1748
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:07,359
talked about that that that was the
 

1749
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,309
talked about that that that was the
um one of the key generating ideas for

1750
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:10,319
um one of the key generating ideas for
 

1751
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,630
um one of the key generating ideas for
even starting out this line of state

1752
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:12,640
even starting out this line of state
 

1753
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,870
even starting out this line of state
space models and it was talking about

1754
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:14,880
space models and it was talking about
 

1755
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,190
space models and it was talking about
the expressivity of linear functions

1756
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,200
the expressivity of linear functions
 

1757
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,470
the expressivity of linear functions
themselves. But you can actually get

1758
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:20,480
themselves. But you can actually get
 

1759
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,390
themselves. But you can actually get
initializations for this that are based

1760
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,400
initializations for this that are based
 

1761
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,430
initializations for this that are based
on some of the calculations uh analytic

1762
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:25,440
on some of the calculations uh analytic
 

1763
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,030
on some of the calculations uh analytic
perspective from the hippo paper and you

1764
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:27,040
perspective from the hippo paper and you
 

1765
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,630
perspective from the hippo paper and you
can use those and those are actually end

1766
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
can use those and those are actually end
 

1767
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,349
can use those and those are actually end
up being very good initializations.

1768
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:31,359
up being very good initializations.
 

1769
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,510
up being very good initializations.
And what the paper authors found is that

1770
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:33,520
And what the paper authors found is that
 

1771
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,190
And what the paper authors found is that
if you actually find these good in

1772
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,200
if you actually find these good in
 

1773
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,750
if you actually find these good in
initializations and you freeze the A to

1774
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:37,760
initializations and you freeze the A to
 

1775
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,150
initializations and you freeze the A to
have those initializations and then you

1776
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
have those initializations and then you
 

1777
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,750
have those initializations and then you
just don't train on A at all. You just

1778
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,760
just don't train on A at all. You just
 

1779
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,109
just don't train on A at all. You just
train the parameters in B and C. Turns

1780
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
train the parameters in B and C. Turns
 

1781
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,030
train the parameters in B and C. Turns
out you can actually do pretty well as

1782
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,040
out you can actually do pretty well as
 

1783
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,309
out you can actually do pretty well as
well. um it's not you can do better if

1784
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:50,319
well. um it's not you can do better if
 

1785
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,870
well. um it's not you can do better if
you also train a but even just these

1786
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:52,880
you also train a but even just these
 

1787
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,950
you also train a but even just these
good initializations initial

1788
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:54,960
good initializations initial
 

1789
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,670
good initializations initial
initializations uh can get you a lot.

1790
00:47:59,670 --> 00:47:59,680
initializations uh can get you a lot.
 

1791
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,270
initializations uh can get you a lot.
So that's what I want to say about

1792
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:01,280
So that's what I want to say about
 

1793
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,510
So that's what I want to say about
initialization. Uh and that kind of

1794
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:03,520
initialization. Uh and that kind of
 

1795
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,030
initialization. Uh and that kind of
comes to the question that was asked

1796
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
comes to the question that was asked
 

1797
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,390
comes to the question that was asked
about I think someone asked this

1798
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,400
about I think someone asked this
 

1799
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,670
about I think someone asked this
question uh last time which is well how

1800
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
question uh last time which is well how
 

1801
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,589
question uh last time which is well how
do we deal with the initializations? How

1802
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:11,599
do we deal with the initializations? How
 

1803
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,710
do we deal with the initializations? How
do we make sure that things aren't

1804
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,720
do we make sure that things aren't
 

1805
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,430
do we make sure that things aren't
blowing up? And so it it is quite

1806
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:15,440
blowing up? And so it it is quite
 

1807
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,910
blowing up? And so it it is quite
complicated but we will basically the

1808
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:17,920
complicated but we will basically the
 

1809
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,030
complicated but we will basically the
bottom line is that you want to use

1810
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,040
bottom line is that you want to use
 

1811
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,790
bottom line is that you want to use
complex values. You want to make sure

1812
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:20,800
complex values. You want to make sure
 

1813
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,030
complex values. You want to make sure
that they're close to the unit circle

1814
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,040
that they're close to the unit circle
 

1815
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,870
that they're close to the unit circle
and then things work out. Okay. Yes.

1816
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880
and then things work out. Okay. Yes.
 

1817
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:45,990
and then things work out. Okay. Yes.
Question.

1818
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,000

 

1819
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,950

Yes. Um so here you're going to think

1820
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:48,960
Yes. Um so here you're going to think
 

1821
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,270
Yes. Um so here you're going to think
about this as

1822
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:51,280
about this as
 

1823
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,950
about this as
uh this is going to make sure that

1824
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:52,960
uh this is going to make sure that
 

1825
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,510
uh this is going to make sure that
you're going to have this is going to be

1826
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:55,520
you're going to have this is going to be
 

1827
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,190
you're going to have this is going to be
negative.

1828
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:57,200
negative.
 

1829
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,030
negative.
So this thing is going to be small.

1830
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,040
So this thing is going to be small.
 

1831
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,150
So this thing is going to be small.
Basically it's going to be e to the

1832
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:02,160
Basically it's going to be e to the
 

1833
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,630
Basically it's going to be e to the
something negative plus a complex part.

1834
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:04,640
something negative plus a complex part.
 

1835
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,910
something negative plus a complex part.
The complex part is going to rotate you

1836
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:07,920
The complex part is going to rotate you
 

1837
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,510
The complex part is going to rotate you
and this part is going to make sure that

1838
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:09,520
and this part is going to make sure that
 

1839
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:15,829
and this part is going to make sure that
you're smaller than one.

1840
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:15,839

 

1841
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:16,870

>> Yes.

1842
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:16,880
>> Yes.
 

1843
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:27,990
>> Yes.
>> So what if the represent

1844
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,000

 

1845
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,589

>> you're saying that can I just default

1846
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:29,599
>> you're saying that can I just default
 

1847
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,470
>> you're saying that can I just default
set my real part to be uh zero all the

1848
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:32,480
set my real part to be uh zero all the
 

1849
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,030
set my real part to be uh zero all the
time?

1850
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:33,040
time?
 

1851
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:33,430
time?
>> Yeah.

1852
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:33,440
>> Yeah.
 

1853
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,510
>> Yeah.
>> Right. So,

1854
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:37,520

 

1855
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,510

um I guess there's nothing preventing

1856
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:39,520
um I guess there's nothing preventing
 

1857
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,589
um I guess there's nothing preventing
you from setting your real part to be

1858
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:41,599
you from setting your real part to be
 

1859
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,870
you from setting your real part to be
zero all the time, but you're losing

1860
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:42,880
zero all the time, but you're losing
 

1861
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,990
zero all the time, but you're losing
expressive power. And in particular, if

1862
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:46,000
expressive power. And in particular, if
 

1863
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,670
expressive power. And in particular, if
all of your data is actually real

1864
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:47,680
all of your data is actually real
 

1865
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,230
all of your data is actually real
valued, uh one of the things that you

1866
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:50,240
valued, uh one of the things that you
 

1867
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,750
valued, uh one of the things that you
can do is you can say, well, how do I

1868
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:51,760
can do is you can say, well, how do I
 

1869
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,030
can do is you can say, well, how do I
deal with the fact that there are now

1870
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
deal with the fact that there are now
 

1871
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,950
deal with the fact that there are now
complex numbers showing up? Is you can

1872
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:54,960
complex numbers showing up? Is you can
 

1873
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,309
complex numbers showing up? Is you can
say, well, I'm going to have complex

1874
00:49:56,309 --> 00:49:56,319
say, well, I'm going to have complex
 

1875
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:57,750
say, well, I'm going to have complex
numbers in the mix so that I can have

1876
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:57,760
numbers in the mix so that I can have
 

1877
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,829
numbers in the mix so that I can have
these properties that I want, but then

1878
00:49:59,829 --> 00:49:59,839
these properties that I want, but then
 

1879
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:00,950
these properties that I want, but then
I'm actually just going to throw out all

1880
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:00,960
I'm actually just going to throw out all
 

1881
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,549
I'm actually just going to throw out all
the complex parts. and you know just use

1882
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:04,559
the complex parts. and you know just use
 

1883
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,670
the complex parts. and you know just use
my real uh the real parts. And so you

1884
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,680
my real uh the real parts. And so you
 

1885
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,910
my real uh the real parts. And so you
don't probably want to be setting your

1886
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:09,920
don't probably want to be setting your
 

1887
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,750
don't probably want to be setting your
the real parts of your system to be

1888
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:11,760
the real parts of your system to be
 

1889
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:20,390
the real parts of your system to be
zero.

1890
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:20,400

 

1891
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:28,710

>> Yes.

1892
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:28,720

 

1893
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:36,150

>> Yes. So, do we need that?

1894
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:36,160

 

1895
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,030

>> You're saying that? So, so you you you

1896
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:39,040
>> You're saying that? So, so you you you
 

1897
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,470
>> You're saying that? So, so you you you
would want it. So, because there's a

1898
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:40,480
would want it. So, because there's a
 

1899
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,470
would want it. So, because there's a
couple of things, right? You're you're

1900
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:42,480
couple of things, right? You're you're
 

1901
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,470
couple of things, right? You're you're
you might want to say that there are

1902
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:44,480
you might want to say that there are
 

1903
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,549
you might want to say that there are
some things that I do want to forget.

1904
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:48,559
some things that I do want to forget.
 

1905
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:49,750
some things that I do want to forget.
There are some things that I want to

1906
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:49,760
There are some things that I want to
 

1907
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,870
There are some things that I want to
learn. There are some things that I want

1908
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:50,880
learn. There are some things that I want
 

1909
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,750
learn. There are some things that I want
to forget. Having that flexibility

1910
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:53,760
to forget. Having that flexibility
 

1911
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,309
to forget. Having that flexibility
allows you to learn that. But if you

1912
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:56,319
allows you to learn that. But if you
 

1913
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,710
allows you to learn that. But if you
always set it to zero, then you're

1914
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:58,720
always set it to zero, then you're
 

1915
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,430
always set it to zero, then you're
you're giving away that

1916
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:01,440
you're giving away that
 

1917
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:11,910
you're giving away that
uh degree of freedom.

1918
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:11,920

 

1919
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:24,390

Other questions? Okay. Yeah.

1920
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:24,400

 

1921
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,549

So you want you want to have your IGEN

1922
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:26,559
So you want you want to have your IGEN
 

1923
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,309
So you want you want to have your IGEN
values to be around the unit circle

1924
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:28,319
values to be around the unit circle
 

1925
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,230
values to be around the unit circle
mostly. Yes. On the unit circle and

1926
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:30,240
mostly. Yes. On the unit circle and
 

1927
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,470
mostly. Yes. On the unit circle and
maybe a few inside. That's what you're

1928
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:32,480
maybe a few inside. That's what you're
 

1929
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:41,270
maybe a few inside. That's what you're
you're hoping to get.

1930
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:41,280

 

1931
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,990

close to zero. So,

1932
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:44,000
close to zero. So,
 

1933
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,589
close to zero. So,
>> yes.

1934
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:45,599
>> yes.
 

1935
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:46,870
>> yes.
No, you don't. No, no, no. You don't

1936
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:46,880
No, you don't. No, no, no. You don't
 

1937
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,150
No, you don't. No, no, no. You don't
want the real part to be mostly close to

1938
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:48,160
want the real part to be mostly close to
 

1939
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,230
want the real part to be mostly close to
zero. You want it to be you want the

1940
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:50,240
zero. You want it to be you want the
 

1941
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,910
zero. You want it to be you want the
magnitude of the thing to be one. And

1942
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:51,920
magnitude of the thing to be one. And
 

1943
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,150
magnitude of the thing to be one. And
you can have whatever distribution

1944
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:54,160
you can have whatever distribution
 

1945
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,670
you can have whatever distribution
between the real and the complex part of

1946
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:55,680
between the real and the complex part of
 

1947
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:04,950
between the real and the complex part of
that you want.

1948
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:04,960

 

1949
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,950

Okay. Good. So what this does is that it

1950
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:08,960
Okay. Good. So what this does is that it
 

1951
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,030
Okay. Good. So what this does is that it
allows you to have this kind of long

1952
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:11,040
allows you to have this kind of long
 

1953
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,230
allows you to have this kind of long
range dependency that uh transformer

1954
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:14,240
range dependency that uh transformer
 

1955
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,349
range dependency that uh transformer
models were historically not as good at.

1956
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:17,359
models were historically not as good at.
 

1957
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:22,309
models were historically not as good at.
So this is a table from this uh S4 paper

1958
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:22,319
So this is a table from this uh S4 paper
 

1959
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,150
So this is a table from this uh S4 paper
and these are a bunch of standard

1960
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:24,160
and these are a bunch of standard
 

1961
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,430
and these are a bunch of standard
benchmarks and this in particular is a

1962
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:27,440
benchmarks and this in particular is a
 

1963
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,030
benchmarks and this in particular is a
particular uh

1964
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:31,040
particular uh
 

1965
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,190
particular uh
uh benchmark that required looking at

1966
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:33,200
uh benchmark that required looking at
 

1967
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,190
uh benchmark that required looking at
lots of historical context. This is part

1968
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,200
lots of historical context. This is part
 

1969
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,910
lots of historical context. This is part
of the long range arena benchmark. And

1970
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:37,920
of the long range arena benchmark. And
 

1971
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,109
of the long range arena benchmark. And
what you can see is that a bunch of

1972
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:39,119
what you can see is that a bunch of
 

1973
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,870
what you can see is that a bunch of
these transformer models could not even

1974
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:40,880
these transformer models could not even
 

1975
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,790
these transformer models could not even
complete this task, but the S4 model

1976
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:44,800
complete this task, but the S4 model
 

1977
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,349
complete this task, but the S4 model
um

1978
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:47,359
um
 

1979
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:52,390
um
made a bunch of progress. Okay, so

1980
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:52,400
made a bunch of progress. Okay, so
 

1981
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,990
made a bunch of progress. Okay, so
we're not going to go into the details

1982
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,000
we're not going to go into the details
 

1983
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,910
we're not going to go into the details
of of of any of these things and we

1984
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:55,920
of of of any of these things and we
 

1985
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,109
of of of any of these things and we
haven't even talked about transformers

1986
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:57,119
haven't even talked about transformers
 

1987
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:57,990
haven't even talked about transformers
yet. That's what we're going to talk

1988
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:58,000
yet. That's what we're going to talk
 

1989
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,190
yet. That's what we're going to talk
about next week. But the point is to

1990
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,200
about next week. But the point is to
 

1991
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,670
about next week. But the point is to
highlight that thinking specifically

1992
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:03,680
highlight that thinking specifically
 

1993
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,270
highlight that thinking specifically
about this long range dependency

1994
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:05,280
about this long range dependency
 

1995
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,990
about this long range dependency
actually allowed the S4 model to

1996
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:08,000
actually allowed the S4 model to
 

1997
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,030
actually allowed the S4 model to
outperform many other state-of-the-art

1998
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:11,040
outperform many other state-of-the-art
 

1999
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,349
outperform many other state-of-the-art
art models particularly on these long

2000
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:13,359
art models particularly on these long
 

2001
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:16,630
art models particularly on these long
range benchmarks. However, what we have

2002
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:16,640
range benchmarks. However, what we have
 

2003
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,670
range benchmarks. However, what we have
the problem is that these were not

2004
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:19,680
the problem is that these were not
 

2005
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,270
the problem is that these were not
necessarily as good as transformers on

2006
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:23,280
necessarily as good as transformers on
 

2007
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,109
necessarily as good as transformers on
other kinds of tasks that did not have

2008
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:25,119
other kinds of tasks that did not have
 

2009
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,790
other kinds of tasks that did not have
this long range dependency. They were

2010
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:26,800
this long range dependency. They were
 

2011
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,710
this long range dependency. They were
not bad, but they weren't as good as

2012
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:28,720
not bad, but they weren't as good as
 

2013
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,190
not bad, but they weren't as good as
attention-based mechanisms. Okay. And

2014
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,200
attention-based mechanisms. Okay. And
 

2015
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,630
attention-based mechanisms. Okay. And
we'll talk about the comparison to

2016
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,640
we'll talk about the comparison to
 

2017
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,870
we'll talk about the comparison to
attention based mechanisms maybe next

2018
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:34,880
attention based mechanisms maybe next
 

2019
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,230
attention based mechanisms maybe next
week after we actually talked about

2020
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:36,240
week after we actually talked about
 

2021
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,349
week after we actually talked about
attention. We haven't really gotten

2022
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:37,359
attention. We haven't really gotten
 

2023
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,349
attention. We haven't really gotten
there yet. Yes. Question.

2024
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:39,359
there yet. Yes. Question.
 

2025
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,670
there yet. Yes. Question.
>> Yeah. I just want to make sure that I'm

2026
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:41,680
>> Yeah. I just want to make sure that I'm
 

2027
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,510
>> Yeah. I just want to make sure that I'm
understanding why we're taking things to

2028
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:43,520
understanding why we're taking things to
 

2029
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,750
understanding why we're taking things to
the complex realm. So, we're saying that

2030
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:45,760
the complex realm. So, we're saying that
 

2031
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,349
the complex realm. So, we're saying that
we're trying to learn some matrix A.

2032
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:47,359
we're trying to learn some matrix A.
 

2033
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,670
we're trying to learn some matrix A.
Yes. And that matrix A is diagonal of

2034
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:49,680
Yes. And that matrix A is diagonal of
 

2035
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,069
Yes. And that matrix A is diagonal of
values.

2036
00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:50,079
values.
 

2037
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:50,710
values.
>> Yes.

2038
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:50,720
>> Yes.
 

2039
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,510
>> Yes.
>> And so, we need to learn those values.

2040
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:53,520
>> And so, we need to learn those values.
 

2041
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:53,750
>> And so, we need to learn those values.
Yes.

2042
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:53,760
Yes.
 

2043
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,309
Yes.
>> And so, we're parameterizing the values.

2044
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
>> And so, we're parameterizing the values.

numbers exponential to the minus

2046
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
numbers exponential to the minus
 

2047
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,470
numbers exponential to the minus
>> correct

2048
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:00,480
>> correct
 

2049
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,870
>> correct
>> and that gives us two degrees of freedom

2050
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:02,880
>> and that gives us two degrees of freedom
 

2051
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,190
>> and that gives us two degrees of freedom
instead of one for every value. So we're

2052
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:05,200
instead of one for every value. So we're
 

2053
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,710
instead of one for every value. So we're
learning two parameters instead of one

2054
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:06,720
learning two parameters instead of one
 

2055
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,309
learning two parameters instead of one
for each value.

2056
00:54:08,309 --> 00:54:08,319
for each value.
 

2057
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,910
for each value.
>> Yes.

2058
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:09,920
>> Yes.
 

2059
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,990
>> Yes.
>> And so I'm just trying to understand

2060
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
>> And so I'm just trying to understand
 

2061
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,790
>> And so I'm just trying to understand
exactly why that is better because it

2062
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:14,800
exactly why that is better because it
 

2063
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,150
exactly why that is better because it
seems to me like the ultimately that it

2064
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:18,160
seems to me like the ultimately that it
 

2065
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,829
seems to me like the ultimately that it
value is just going to be a number,

2066
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:19,839
value is just going to be a number,
 

2067
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,990
value is just going to be a number,
right? Like at some point

2068
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,000
right? Like at some point
 

2069
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,910
right? Like at some point
>> it's a number and a direction.

2070
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:23,920
>> it's a number and a direction.
 

2071
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,150
>> it's a number and a direction.
>> Okay. So that second degree of freedom.

2072
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:28,160
>> Okay. So that second degree of freedom.
 

2073
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,150
>> Okay. So that second degree of freedom.
>> Okay. I think yeah, if you could just

2074
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:30,160
>> Okay. I think yeah, if you could just
 

2075
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,510
>> Okay. I think yeah, if you could just
explain that like again.

2076
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:31,520
explain that like again.
 

2077
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,829
explain that like again.
>> So what so what is what are these values

2078
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:33,839
>> So what so what is what are these values
 

2079
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,510
>> So what so what is what are these values
doing? Right? These values are talking

2080
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:35,520
doing? Right? These values are talking
 

2081
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,230
doing? Right? These values are talking
about or they're they're affecting how

2082
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:38,240
about or they're they're affecting how
 

2083
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,910
about or they're they're affecting how
your history evolves at every time step.

2084
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:41,920
your history evolves at every time step.
 

2085
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,349
your history evolves at every time step.
Okay? And so you you're with me that you

2086
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
Okay? And so you you're with me that you
 

2087
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,549
Okay? And so you you're with me that you
don't want them to be big and you don't

2088
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:46,559
don't want them to be big and you don't
 

2089
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,710
don't want them to be big and you don't
want them to be small. Okay? But you

2090
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:48,720
want them to be small. Okay? But you
 

2091
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,430
want them to be small. Okay? But you
want them to somehow be able to train.

2092
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:51,440
want them to somehow be able to train.
 

2093
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,109
want them to somehow be able to train.
Mhm.

2094
00:54:53,109 --> 00:54:53,119
Mhm.
 

2095
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,430
Mhm.
>> So if you want them to be able to train,

2096
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:55,440
>> So if you want them to be able to train,
 

2097
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,910
>> So if you want them to be able to train,
you have to give them somewhere to move,

2098
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:57,920
you have to give them somewhere to move,
 

2099
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,910
you have to give them somewhere to move,
something to do. And you so you want to

2100
00:54:59,910 --> 00:54:59,920
something to do. And you so you want to
 

2101
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,750
something to do. And you so you want to
be able to adjust your IGEN values to

2102
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:01,760
be able to adjust your IGEN values to
 

2103
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,750
be able to adjust your IGEN values to
see how different performance changes.

2104
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:03,760
see how different performance changes.
 

2105
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,870
see how different performance changes.
And so if you want to have a continuous

2106
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:06,880
And so if you want to have a continuous
 

2107
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,510
And so if you want to have a continuous
space where you can have values that all

2108
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,520
space where you can have values that all
 

2109
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:15,190
space where you can have values that all
have magnitude one, but

2110
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,200

 

2111
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,870

you're you're kind of your unit circle

2112
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:16,880
you're you're kind of your unit circle
 

2113
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,390
you're you're kind of your unit circle
is all you got, right? Like you

2114
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:18,400
is all you got, right? Like you
 

2115
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,990
is all you got, right? Like you
otherwise if you're restricting to reals

2116
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,000
otherwise if you're restricting to reals
 

2117
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,349
otherwise if you're restricting to reals
then you have plus one and minus one and

2118
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:21,359
then you have plus one and minus one and
 

2119
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,470
then you have plus one and minus one and
how are you ever going to train that

2120
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:22,480
how are you ever going to train that
 

2121
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,069
how are you ever going to train that
thing?

2122
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:24,079
thing?
 

2123
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:24,710
thing?
>> That makes sense.

2124
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:24,720
>> That makes sense.
 

2125
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,510
>> That makes sense.
>> Does that Yeah.

2126
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:25,520
>> Does that Yeah.
 

2127
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,349
>> Does that Yeah.
>> So the degrees of freedom allow for the

2128
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:27,359
>> So the degrees of freedom allow for the
 

2129
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:27,990
>> So the degrees of freedom allow for the
optimization.

2130
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:28,000
optimization.
 

2131
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,069
optimization.
>> So yeah now you can optimize on on this

2132
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:30,079
>> So yeah now you can optimize on on this
 

2133
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,510
>> So yeah now you can optimize on on this
unit circle right.

2134
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:31,520
unit circle right.
 

2135
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,790
unit circle right.
>> Okay sense.

2136
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:34,800
>> Okay sense.
 

2137
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,270
>> Okay sense.
>> Okay good.

2138
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,280
>> Okay good.
 

2139
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,270
>> Okay good.
Okay.

2140
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:39,280
Okay.
 

2141
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,589
Okay.
So this concludes basically what I

2142
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
So this concludes basically what I
 

2143
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,230
So this concludes basically what I
wanted to say about S4. Okay.

2144
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:46,240
wanted to say about S4. Okay.
 

2145
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,069
wanted to say about S4. Okay.
What did we have? Just to summarize, we

2146
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:48,079
What did we have? Just to summarize, we
 

2147
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,829
What did we have? Just to summarize, we
had an linear time invariant system and

2148
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:51,839
had an linear time invariant system and
 

2149
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,710
had an linear time invariant system and
the key trick that we used was we used

2150
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:54,720
the key trick that we used was we used
 

2151
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,789
the key trick that we used was we used
the fast forier transform to be able to

2152
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:58,799
the fast forier transform to be able to
 

2153
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,630
the fast forier transform to be able to
speed up

2154
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:00,640
speed up
 

2155
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,710
speed up
uh the convolutions and this allowed us

2156
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,720
uh the convolutions and this allowed us
 

2157
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,309
uh the convolutions and this allowed us
and the fact that we could write this as

2158
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:04,319
and the fact that we could write this as
 

2159
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,910
and the fact that we could write this as
convolutions at all by removing the

2160
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:05,920
convolutions at all by removing the
 

2161
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,150
convolutions at all by removing the
horizontal nonlinearity allowed us to

2162
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:08,160
horizontal nonlinearity allowed us to
 

2163
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,109
horizontal nonlinearity allowed us to
parallelize the FFT further allowed us

2164
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:11,119
parallelize the FFT further allowed us
 

2165
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,270
parallelize the FFT further allowed us
to speed that up and then by

2166
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:13,280
to speed that up and then by
 

2167
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,750
to speed that up and then by
appropriately choosing a to be diagonal

2168
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:15,760
appropriately choosing a to be diagonal
 

2169
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,390
appropriately choosing a to be diagonal
signal and choosing the appropriate igen

2170
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,400
signal and choosing the appropriate igen
 

2171
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,630
signal and choosing the appropriate igen
values and initializations for that we

2172
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:20,640
values and initializations for that we
 

2173
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,309
values and initializations for that we
were able to get the kind of long range

2174
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:22,319
were able to get the kind of long range
 

2175
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,150
were able to get the kind of long range
dependencies that we needed. Okay, these

2176
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:24,160
dependencies that we needed. Okay, these
 

2177
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,910
dependencies that we needed. Okay, these
are the two different things that were

2178
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:25,920
are the two different things that were
 

2179
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,430
are the two different things that were
important

2180
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,440
important
 

2181
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,870
important
but this wasn't as good as it could get

2182
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:30,880
but this wasn't as good as it could get
 

2183
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,230
but this wasn't as good as it could get
and so that's what brings us to now the

2184
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:34,240
and so that's what brings us to now the
 

2185
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,549
and so that's what brings us to now the
latest version or actually there's now a

2186
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:36,559
latest version or actually there's now a
 

2187
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,549
latest version or actually there's now a
further evolution on this. There's like

2188
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:38,559
further evolution on this. There's like
 

2189
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,789
further evolution on this. There's like
Mamba 2 and then there's Deltanet but

2190
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:40,799
Mamba 2 and then there's Deltanet but
 

2191
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,069
Mamba 2 and then there's Deltanet but
I'm not going to talk about either of

2192
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:42,079
I'm not going to talk about either of
 

2193
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,190
I'm not going to talk about either of
those. um maybe next year you can take

2194
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:45,200
those. um maybe next year you can take
 

2195
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,789
those. um maybe next year you can take
the class and we'll talk about them then

2196
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:46,799
the class and we'll talk about them then
 

2197
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,030
the class and we'll talk about them then
or uh there's actually a really nice

2198
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,040
or uh there's actually a really nice
 

2199
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,109
or uh there's actually a really nice
blog post about Deltaet that after this

00:56:51,109 --> 00:56:51,119
blog post about Deltaet that after this
 

2201
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,390
blog post about Deltaet that after this
lecture you will probably be able to

2202
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,400
lecture you will probably be able to
 

2203
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,230
lecture you will probably be able to
read and understand on your own. So if

2204
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:54,240
read and understand on your own. So if
 

2205
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,150
read and understand on your own. So if
you want to you can uh take a pass at

2206
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
you want to you can uh take a pass at
 

2207
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,870
you want to you can uh take a pass at
that but I'm going to talk about Mamba

2208
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:58,880
that but I'm going to talk about Mamba
 

2209
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,870
that but I'm going to talk about Mamba
now.

2210
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:00,880
now.
 

2211
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,069
now.
So the S6 version takes yet another lens

2212
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:06,079
So the S6 version takes yet another lens
 

2213
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,230
So the S6 version takes yet another lens
on linear systems and uses that to give

2214
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
on linear systems and uses that to give
 

2215
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,630
on linear systems and uses that to give
one more degree of freedom to the system

2216
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:12,640
one more degree of freedom to the system
 

2217
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,870
one more degree of freedom to the system
that can enhance performance. So we

2218
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:14,880
that can enhance performance. So we
 

2219
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,549
that can enhance performance. So we
talked about you know state space

2220
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:16,559
talked about you know state space
 

2221
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,190
talked about you know state space
systems and state space models as having

2222
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:19,200
systems and state space models as having
 

2223
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,190
systems and state space models as having
the recurrent hidden state bas

2224
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:21,200
the recurrent hidden state bas
 

2225
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,069
the recurrent hidden state bas
statebased view and that allowed us to

2226
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:24,079
statebased view and that allowed us to
 

2227
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,069
statebased view and that allowed us to
be very fast at at inference time.

2228
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:28,079
be very fast at at inference time.
 

2229
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,390
be very fast at at inference time.
There was the input output view which

2230
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:30,400
There was the input output view which
 

2231
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,990
There was the input output view which
basically said that look you don't need

2232
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:32,000
basically said that look you don't need
 

2233
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,230
basically said that look you don't need
to you can express these things as

2234
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:34,240
to you can express these things as
 

2235
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,069
to you can express these things as
convolutions you can train using

2236
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:36,079
convolutions you can train using
 

2237
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,190
convolutions you can train using
convolutions therefore you can

2238
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:37,200
convolutions therefore you can
 

2239
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,470
convolutions therefore you can
parallelize and you can have fast

2240
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:38,480
parallelize and you can have fast
 

2241
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,390
parallelize and you can have fast
training. So that was the um input

2242
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:42,400
training. So that was the um input
 

2243
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,190
training. So that was the um input
output view. But when you think about

2244
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:45,200
output view. But when you think about
 

2245
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,430
output view. But when you think about
discrete time systems, there's actually

2246
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:47,440
discrete time systems, there's actually
 

2247
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,510
discrete time systems, there's actually
a third view and that is

2248
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:51,520
a third view and that is
 

2249
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,829
a third view and that is
the fact that a discrete system can be

2250
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:53,839
the fact that a discrete system can be
 

2251
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,750
the fact that a discrete system can be
thought of as a sampling or a

2252
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:55,760
thought of as a sampling or a
 

2253
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,549
thought of as a sampling or a
discretization of an underlying

2254
00:57:58,549 --> 00:57:58,559
discretization of an underlying
 

2255
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,270
discretization of an underlying
continuous time process.

2256
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:01,280
continuous time process.
 

2257
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,789
continuous time process.
Okay.

2258
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:02,799
Okay.
 

2259
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:06,069
Okay.
And taking this viewpoint

2260
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:06,079
And taking this viewpoint
 

2261
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,750
And taking this viewpoint
a allows us to get an element of

2262
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760
a allows us to get an element of
 

2263
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,349
a allows us to get an element of
selectivity

2264
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:11,359
selectivity
 

2265
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,670
selectivity
into the system which can help

2266
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,680
into the system which can help
 

2267
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,430
into the system which can help
performance. Okay. So the problem with

2268
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:17,440
performance. Okay. So the problem with
 

2269
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:24,069
performance. Okay. So the problem with
the S4 style or the LTI style of um

2270
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:24,079
the S4 style or the LTI style of um
 

2271
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,069
the S4 style or the LTI style of um
systems was that look in some sense more

2272
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:28,079
systems was that look in some sense more
 

2273
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,870
systems was that look in some sense more
history is always better. Okay. So if I

2274
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
history is always better. Okay. So if I
 

2275
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,589
history is always better. Okay. So if I
can put more and more and more and more

2276
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:33,599
can put more and more and more and more
 

2277
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,270
can put more and more and more and more
stuff into my state the more I can do

2278
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:37,280
stuff into my state the more I can do
 

2279
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,829
stuff into my state the more I can do
tasks like associative recall okay

2280
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:41,839
tasks like associative recall okay
 

2281
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,030
tasks like associative recall okay
but at some like you know some I don't

2282
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:45,040
but at some like you know some I don't
 

2283
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,069
but at some like you know some I don't
have infinite state something has to

2284
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:48,079
have infinite state something has to
 

2285
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,510
have infinite state something has to
give somewhere okay

2286
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:51,520
give somewhere okay
 

2287
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,910
give somewhere okay
so what are my choices here right my

2288
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:53,920
so what are my choices here right my
 

2289
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,589
so what are my choices here right my
choices are to either somehow forget my

2290
00:58:55,589 --> 00:58:55,599
choices are to either somehow forget my
 

2291
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,910
choices are to either somehow forget my
fast or somehow choose what is and is

2292
00:58:59,910 --> 00:58:59,920
fast or somehow choose what is and is
 

2293
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,309
fast or somehow choose what is and is
not important

2294
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:02,319
not important
 

2295
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:05,109
not important
in adding to my state. So if I could

2296
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:05,119
in adding to my state. So if I could
 

2297
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,950
in adding to my state. So if I could
somehow be selective about when I want

2298
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:08,960
somehow be selective about when I want
 

2299
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,710
somehow be selective about when I want
to put something into my state and when

2300
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:10,720
to put something into my state and when
 

2301
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,150
to put something into my state and when
I don't want to put something into my

2302
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:12,160
I don't want to put something into my
 

2303
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,230
I don't want to put something into my
state, this could maybe be helpful.

2304
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:16,240
state, this could maybe be helpful.
 

2305
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,589
state, this could maybe be helpful.
The problem with LTI systems and

2306
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:19,599
The problem with LTI systems and
 

2307
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,670
The problem with LTI systems and
convolutions in general is that if I

2308
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:21,680
convolutions in general is that if I
 

2309
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,630
convolutions in general is that if I
want a particular token to look maybe

2310
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:24,640
want a particular token to look maybe
 

2311
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,789
want a particular token to look maybe
you know 10 time steps in the past and

2312
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:26,799
you know 10 time steps in the past and
 

2313
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,470
you know 10 time steps in the past and
it's relevant for particular kinds of

2314
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:28,480
it's relevant for particular kinds of
 

2315
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,750
it's relevant for particular kinds of
tokens to do that because of the LTI in

2316
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:31,760
tokens to do that because of the LTI in
 

2317
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,150
tokens to do that because of the LTI in
this it means every token has to look 10

2318
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:34,160
this it means every token has to look 10
 

2319
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,109
this it means every token has to look 10
time steps in the past but maybe there's

2320
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,119
time steps in the past but maybe there's
 

2321
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,109
time steps in the past but maybe there's
some differences here in how I want to

2322
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:39,119
some differences here in how I want to
 

2323
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,630
some differences here in how I want to
do this and maybe I want to be able to

2324
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:40,640
do this and maybe I want to be able to
 

2325
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,430
do this and maybe I want to be able to
adjust when I look in the past and when

2326
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:43,440
adjust when I look in the past and when
 

2327
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,670
adjust when I look in the past and when
I don't look in the

2328
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:45,680
I don't look in the
 

2329
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,630
I don't look in the
So to be able to do this, can I have

2330
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:48,640
So to be able to do this, can I have
 

2331
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,829
So to be able to do this, can I have
some extra degree of freedom? And that's

2332
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:51,839
some extra degree of freedom? And that's
 

2333
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,309
some extra degree of freedom? And that's
what we're going to try to talk about

2334
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:54,319
what we're going to try to talk about
 

2335
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,990
what we're going to try to talk about
next using this continuous time

2336
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:56,000
next using this continuous time
 

2337
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,870
next using this continuous time
viewpoint. Okay, everyone with me?

2338
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:00,880
viewpoint. Okay, everyone with me?
 

2339
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,470
viewpoint. Okay, everyone with me?
So for that I want to think about now my

2340
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:04,480
So for that I want to think about now my
 

2341
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,069
So for that I want to think about now my
uh discrete time system here.

2342
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:08,079
uh discrete time system here.
 

2343
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,710
uh discrete time system here.
I want to think about it essentially as

2344
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:10,720
I want to think about it essentially as
 

2345
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,910
I want to think about it essentially as
a sampling of a continuous time system.

2346
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:13,920
a sampling of a continuous time system.
 

2347
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,670
a sampling of a continuous time system.
And one way to think about that is

2348
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:15,680
And one way to think about that is
 

2349
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,150
And one way to think about that is
basically I want to think about um

2350
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:20,160
basically I want to think about um
 

2351
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,750
basically I want to think about um
some continuous time system of this

2352
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
some continuous time system of this
 

2353
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,710
some continuous time system of this
form. So instead of having an h of t

2354
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:24,720
form. So instead of having an h of t
 

2355
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,030
form. So instead of having an h of t
here, I want an h dot, right? I'm

2356
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:27,040
here, I want an h dot, right? I'm
 

2357
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,670
here, I want an h dot, right? I'm
thinking about the rate of change as

2358
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:29,680
thinking about the rate of change as
 

2359
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,430
thinking about the rate of change as
being represented by a linear system.

2360
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:33,440
being represented by a linear system.
 

2361
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,230
being represented by a linear system.
Okay,

2362
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:36,240
Okay,
 

2363
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,069
Okay,
this A and this B is not the same. You

2364
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:38,079
this A and this B is not the same. You
 

2365
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,910
this A and this B is not the same. You
have to basically make sure that you

2366
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:39,920
have to basically make sure that you
 

2367
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,710
have to basically make sure that you
match these up. But if I want to now

2368
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:42,720
match these up. But if I want to now
 

2369
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,430
match these up. But if I want to now
convert from a continuous time system to

2370
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:45,440
convert from a continuous time system to
 

2371
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,990
convert from a continuous time system to
a discrete time system, I need to fix

2372
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,000
a discrete time system, I need to fix
 

2373
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,150
a discrete time system, I need to fix
and understand what my sampling interval

2374
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:50,160
and understand what my sampling interval
 

2375
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,309
and understand what my sampling interval
is. Right? There's many different ways

2376
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:52,319
is. Right? There's many different ways
 

2377
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,630
is. Right? There's many different ways
you can do this. You can read multiple

2378
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:54,640
you can do this. You can read multiple
 

2379
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,309
you can do this. You can read multiple
Wikipedia articles about many different

2380
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:56,319
Wikipedia articles about many different
 

2381
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,549
Wikipedia articles about many different
ways of sampling. We're going to just

2382
01:00:58,549 --> 01:00:58,559
ways of sampling. We're going to just
 

2383
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,109
ways of sampling. We're going to just
pick one. And what I want to start is

2384
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:01,119
pick one. And what I want to start is
 

2385
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,630
pick one. And what I want to start is
just with the scalar case, right? Let's

2386
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:02,640
just with the scalar case, right? Let's
 

2387
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,549
just with the scalar case, right? Let's
understand this. In the scalar simple

2388
01:01:04,549 --> 01:01:04,559
understand this. In the scalar simple
 

2389
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,349
understand this. In the scalar simple
case, the exact same thing holds

2390
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:07,359
case, the exact same thing holds
 

2391
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,990
case, the exact same thing holds
basically verbatim for the vector case.

2392
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:10,000
basically verbatim for the vector case.
 

2393
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,230
basically verbatim for the vector case.
The all the key meat is in here.

2394
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:14,240
The all the key meat is in here.
 

2395
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,630
The all the key meat is in here.
So let's say I have some continuous time

2396
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:16,640
So let's say I have some continuous time
 

2397
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,270
So let's say I have some continuous time
system. I'm going to call this, you

2398
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:19,280
system. I'm going to call this, you
 

2399
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,829
system. I'm going to call this, you
know, x dot of t is axt plus b t. How do

2400
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:21,839
know, x dot of t is axt plus b t. How do
 

2401
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,910
know, x dot of t is axt plus b t. How do
I convert this now to an underlying

2402
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:23,920
I convert this now to an underlying
 

2403
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,430
I convert this now to an underlying
discrete time system? Well, I fix a

2404
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:27,440
discrete time system? Well, I fix a
 

2405
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,150
discrete time system? Well, I fix a
sampling time. I call this delta t.

2406
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,160
sampling time. I call this delta t.
 

2407
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,870
sampling time. I call this delta t.
And let's assume that this u of t is

2408
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:34,880
And let's assume that this u of t is
 

2409
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,069
And let's assume that this u of t is
basically has this peacewise constant

2410
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:38,079
basically has this peacewise constant
 

2411
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,270
basically has this peacewise constant
nature. So delta t is small enough that

2412
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:41,280
nature. So delta t is small enough that
 

2413
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,510
nature. So delta t is small enough that
whatever my u of t is I can approximate

2414
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:43,520
whatever my u of t is I can approximate
 

2415
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,349
whatever my u of t is I can approximate
it by these peacewise constant uh

2416
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:47,359
it by these peacewise constant uh
 

2417
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,789
it by these peacewise constant uh
uh steps. Okay.

2418
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:50,799
uh steps. Okay.
 

2419
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:55,430
uh steps. Okay.
So if I do this

2420
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:55,440

 

2421
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,549

I can basically rewrite

2422
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:00,559

 

2423
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,630

or I can I can say that well if I have x

2424
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:02,640
or I can I can say that well if I have x
 

2425
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,030
or I can I can say that well if I have x
at time delta t now let's say x0 is

2426
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:05,040
at time delta t now let's say x0 is
 

2427
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,710
at time delta t now let's say x0 is
where I started out that was my initial

2428
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:06,720
where I started out that was my initial
 

2429
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,789
where I started out that was my initial
state then I have x at time delta t is

2430
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:10,799
state then I have x at time delta t is
 

2431
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:13,430
state then I have x at time delta t is
basically an exponential decay or growth

2432
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
basically an exponential decay or growth
 

2433
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,069
basically an exponential decay or growth
depending on the value of a times my

2434
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:16,079
depending on the value of a times my
 

2435
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,670
depending on the value of a times my
initial state xnot plus the impulse

2436
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:19,680
initial state xnot plus the impulse
 

2437
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,870
initial state xnot plus the impulse
response that comes from the uh input

2438
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:24,880
response that comes from the uh input
 

2439
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,030
response that comes from the uh input
right these are the two components that

2440
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,040
right these are the two components that
 

2441
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,390
right these are the two components that
I'm going to get when I try to

2442
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:28,400
I'm going to get when I try to
 

2443
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,670
I'm going to get when I try to
discretize this okay

2444
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:31,680
discretize this okay
 

2445
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,710
discretize this okay
just to remind you all when I have this

2446
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:34,720
just to remind you all when I have this
 

2447
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,670
just to remind you all when I have this
kind of system here

2448
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680
kind of system here
 

2449
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,549
kind of system here
which is the case remember for lambda in

2450
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:40,559
which is the case remember for lambda in
 

2451
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,349
which is the case remember for lambda in
discrete time systems lambda outside the

2452
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:43,359
discrete time systems lambda outside the
 

2453
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,510
discrete time systems lambda outside the
unit circle meant you blew up lambda

2454
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:45,520
unit circle meant you blew up lambda
 

2455
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,670
unit circle meant you blew up lambda
inside the unit circle meant you decayed

2456
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:47,680
inside the unit circle meant you decayed
 

2457
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,109
inside the unit circle meant you decayed
what is the corresponding thing for

2458
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,119
what is the corresponding thing for
 

2459
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:52,950
what is the corresponding thing for
discrete For continuous time systems,

2460
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:52,960
discrete For continuous time systems,

>> positive and negative,

2462
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:53,920
>> positive and negative,
 

2463
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,589
>> positive and negative,
>> positive and negative, right? So if this

2464
01:02:55,589 --> 01:02:55,599
>> positive and negative, right? So if this
 

2465
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,030
>> positive and negative, right? So if this
is greater than zero, this means you

2466
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:57,040
is greater than zero, this means you
 

2467
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,670
is greater than zero, this means you
explode.

2468
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,680
explode.
 

2469
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,670
explode.
This means you

2470
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
This means you
 

2471
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,549
This means you
decay to zero. Okay,

2472
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:06,559

 

2473
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:08,309

so we're here in this case. We don't

2474
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:08,319
so we're here in this case. We don't
 

2475
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:09,589
so we're here in this case. We don't
want to be in this exploding case. So

2476
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:09,599
want to be in this exploding case. So
 

2477
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:10,630
want to be in this exploding case. So
we're just basically going to assume

2478
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:10,640
we're just basically going to assume
 

2479
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,829
we're just basically going to assume
that we have an a that is less than zero

2480
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:13,839
that we have an a that is less than zero
 

2481
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,150
that we have an a that is less than zero
uh for for the purposes of this

2482
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:16,160
uh for for the purposes of this
 

2483
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,029
uh for for the purposes of this
conversation.

2484
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:19,039
conversation.
 

2485
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,750
conversation.
But I can use this now to basically

2486
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:21,760
But I can use this now to basically
 

2487
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,630
But I can use this now to basically
sample

2488
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:24,640
sample
 

2489
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,390
sample
my continuous time system. Right? This

2490
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:26,400
my continuous time system. Right? This
 

2491
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,390
my continuous time system. Right? This
is my equation for a continuous time.

2492
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:28,400
is my equation for a continuous time.
 

2493
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,950
is my equation for a continuous time.
And I can correspondingly write a

2494
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:30,960
And I can correspondingly write a
 

2495
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,829
And I can correspondingly write a
discrete time equation like this.

2496
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,839
discrete time equation like this.
 

2497
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:37,510
discrete time equation like this.
Everyone with me?

2498
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:37,520

 

2499
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,069

Okay, good.

2500
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:40,079
Okay, good.
 

2501
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,789
Okay, good.
So it turns out that basically now I

2502
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:42,799
So it turns out that basically now I
 

2503
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,190
So it turns out that basically now I
have essentially this is like the A and

2504
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:45,200
have essentially this is like the A and
 

2505
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,069
have essentially this is like the A and
this is like the B.

2506
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:48,079
this is like the B.
 

2507
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,630
this is like the B.
But I have this additional player here.

2508
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:50,640
But I have this additional player here.
 

2509
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,750
But I have this additional player here.
I have this delta T. And by changing

2510
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:53,760
I have this delta T. And by changing
 

2511
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,109
I have this delta T. And by changing
delta T, I can change the nature of the

2512
01:03:59,109 --> 01:03:59,119
delta T, I can change the nature of the
 

2513
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,710
delta T, I can change the nature of the
A matrix essentially and the B matrix,

2514
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:02,720
A matrix essentially and the B matrix,
 

2515
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,470
A matrix essentially and the B matrix,
right? Because these things matter. So

2516
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480
right? Because these things matter. So
 

2517
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,150
right? Because these things matter. So
what happens if I choose this

2518
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:12,160

 

2519
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,309

delta t being close to zero and what

2520
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:16,319
delta t being close to zero and what
 

2521
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,990
delta t being close to zero and what
happens if this delta t is large?

2522
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,000
happens if this delta t is large?
 

2523
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,589
happens if this delta t is large?
Actually take a minute. Why don't I just

2524
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:19,599
Actually take a minute. Why don't I just
 

2525
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,270
Actually take a minute. Why don't I just
let you guys think through this and work

2526
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:21,280
let you guys think through this and work
 

2527
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,670
let you guys think through this and work
this out? What happens when delta t is

2528
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:23,680
this out? What happens when delta t is
 

2529
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,510
this out? What happens when delta t is
close to zero? What happens when delta t

2530
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:25,520
close to zero? What happens when delta t
 

2531
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,069
close to zero? What happens when delta t
is large for both of these two

2532
01:04:28,069 --> 01:04:28,079
is large for both of these two
 

2533
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,750
is large for both of these two
components here?

2534
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:31,760

 

2535
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:38,069

Any

2536
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:38,079

 

2537
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,910

questions? Is it clear what I'm asking?

2538
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:39,920
questions? Is it clear what I'm asking?
 

2539
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,950
questions? Is it clear what I'm asking?
Yes.

2540
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:42,960

 

2541
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,710

>> Yes.

2542
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:48,720

 

2543
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,589

>> Ah, okay. So, why are we going back and

2544
01:04:51,589 --> 01:04:51,599
>> Ah, okay. So, why are we going back and
 

2545
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:52,950
>> Ah, okay. So, why are we going back and
forth from continuous time? Let me

2546
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:52,960
forth from continuous time? Let me
 

2547
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,829
forth from continuous time? Let me
answer this question for everyone.

2548
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:55,839
answer this question for everyone.
 

2549
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,829
answer this question for everyone.
What I want to be able to do is I want

2550
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:57,839
What I want to be able to do is I want
 

2551
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,829
What I want to be able to do is I want
to be able to use the thinking and

2552
01:04:59,829 --> 01:04:59,839
to be able to use the thinking and
 

2553
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:04,309
to be able to use the thinking and
interpretation from continuous time to

2554
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:04,319
interpretation from continuous time to
 

2555
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,309
interpretation from continuous time to
understand and make moves in discrete

2556
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:06,319
understand and make moves in discrete
 

2557
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,710
understand and make moves in discrete
time. So what I want to first establish

2558
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:08,720
time. So what I want to first establish
 

2559
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,950
time. So what I want to first establish
is the correspondence between continuous

2560
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:10,960
is the correspondence between continuous
 

2561
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,789
is the correspondence between continuous
time and discrete time. So if I have a

2562
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:12,799
time and discrete time. So if I have a
 

2563
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,710
time and discrete time. So if I have a
discrete time system and I'm imagining

2564
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:14,720
discrete time system and I'm imagining
 

2565
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,990
discrete time system and I'm imagining
it as a

2566
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:18,000
it as a
 

2567
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,750
it as a
as being derived from an underlying

2568
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:19,760
as being derived from an underlying
 

2569
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,630
as being derived from an underlying
continuous time system,

2570
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:22,640
continuous time system,
 

2571
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,950
continuous time system,
the only reason I'm doing that is for

2572
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:24,960
the only reason I'm doing that is for
 

2573
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,349
the only reason I'm doing that is for
conceptual purposes. I'm never going to

2574
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:27,359
conceptual purposes. I'm never going to
 

2575
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:30,150
conceptual purposes. I'm never going to
be using the continuous time system in

2576
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:30,160
be using the continuous time system in
 

2577
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,470
be using the continuous time system in
actually implementing any algorithm. I'm

2578
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:32,480
actually implementing any algorithm. I'm
 

2579
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:49,029
actually implementing any algorithm. I'm
but it's helping me think about things.

2580
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:49,039

 

2581
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,549

So when you're doing this sampling

2582
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:50,559
So when you're doing this sampling
 

2583
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,470
So when you're doing this sampling
basically the choice that you have the

2584
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:52,480
basically the choice that you have the
 

2585
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,549
basically the choice that you have the
choice that you have let me just maybe

2586
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:54,559
choice that you have let me just maybe
 

2587
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,630
choice that you have let me just maybe
draw a picture here that will maybe will

2588
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:56,640
draw a picture here that will maybe will
 

2589
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:04,549
draw a picture here that will maybe will
also help right let's say I have some

2590
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:04,559

 

2591
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,910

I have some signal here.

2592
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:07,920
I have some signal here.
 

2593
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,549
I have some signal here.
Okay, this is my signal. And by choosing

2594
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:10,559
Okay, this is my signal. And by choosing
 

2595
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,630
Okay, this is my signal. And by choosing
different sampling intervals, right? So

2596
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
different sampling intervals, right? So
 

2597
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,950
different sampling intervals, right? So
I can choose a sampling interval like

2598
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:14,960
I can choose a sampling interval like
 

2599
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,910
I can choose a sampling interval like
this.

2600
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:19,920

 

2601
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,430

And then these are my samples. These are

2602
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:21,440
And then these are my samples. These are
 

2603
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:28,309
And then these are my samples. These are
my big delta t's.

2604
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:28,319

 

2605
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,309

And then if I do the sampling, all you

2606
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:30,319
And then if I do the sampling, all you
 

2607
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,789
And then if I do the sampling, all you
see are these green dots.

2608
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:32,799
see are these green dots.
 

2609
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:35,670
see are these green dots.
This looks like a pretty like constant

2610
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:35,680
This looks like a pretty like constant
 

2611
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,910
This looks like a pretty like constant
signal in some sense, right? But if I

2612
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:37,920
signal in some sense, right? But if I
 

2613
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,349
signal in some sense, right? But if I
chose a different sampling interval

2614
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:41,359
chose a different sampling interval
 

2615
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:54,789
chose a different sampling interval
and I chose

2616
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:54,799

 

2617
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:59,190

now I can get much more uh I can get a

2618
01:06:59,190 --> 01:06:59,200
now I can get much more uh I can get a
 

2619
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,390
now I can get much more uh I can get a
much higher frequency. This is like

2620
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:00,400
much higher frequency. This is like
 

2621
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,829
much higher frequency. This is like
related to the Nyquis theorem for those

2622
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:01,839
related to the Nyquis theorem for those
 

2623
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,750
related to the Nyquis theorem for those
of you who have seen signal processing,

2624
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:03,760
of you who have seen signal processing,
 

2625
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,910
of you who have seen signal processing,
right? This is basically the Nyquis rate

2626
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:05,920
right? This is basically the Nyquis rate
 

2627
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,150
right? This is basically the Nyquis rate
of sampling that allows you to capture

2628
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:08,160
of sampling that allows you to capture
 

2629
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,390
of sampling that allows you to capture
the different frequencies that you have.

2630
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:10,400
the different frequencies that you have.
 

2631
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,470
the different frequencies that you have.
We're not talking about that here, but

2632
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:12,480
We're not talking about that here, but
 

2633
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,029
We're not talking about that here, but
basically the sampling interval that you

2634
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:15,039
basically the sampling interval that you
 

2635
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,549
basically the sampling interval that you
uh that you choose

2636
01:07:18,549 --> 01:07:18,559
uh that you choose
 

2637
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,470
uh that you choose
captures different information. So this

2638
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:20,480
captures different information. So this
 

2639
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,230
captures different information. So this
you can have a discrete time system that

2640
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:22,240
you can have a discrete time system that
 

2641
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,589
you can have a discrete time system that
is a function of a continuous time

2642
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:23,599
is a function of a continuous time
 

2643
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,990
is a function of a continuous time
system, but by choosing different

2644
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:26,000
system, but by choosing different
 

2645
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,510
system, but by choosing different
sampling intervals, you're essentially

2646
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520
sampling intervals, you're essentially
 

2647
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,230
sampling intervals, you're essentially
capturing different behaviors.

2648
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:30,240
capturing different behaviors.
 

2649
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,910
capturing different behaviors.
of the underlying continuous time

2650
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:31,920
of the underlying continuous time
 

2651
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,950
of the underlying continuous time
system. That's that's what I want you to

2652
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:34,960
system. That's that's what I want you to
 

2653
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,990
system. That's that's what I want you to
see. And I want you to see that

2654
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:36,000
see. And I want you to see that
 

2655
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,910
see. And I want you to see that
mathematically by trying to plug in some

2656
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:37,920
mathematically by trying to plug in some
 

2657
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,349
mathematically by trying to plug in some
like plug in some numbers here and play

2658
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:39,359
like plug in some numbers here and play
 

2659
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:43,829
like plug in some numbers here and play
with this. Is that clear? Yes. Okay. So,

2660
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:43,839
with this. Is that clear? Yes. Okay. So,
 

2661
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,190
with this. Is that clear? Yes. Okay. So,
do you want another minute to try and

2662
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:45,200
do you want another minute to try and
 

2663
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,910
do you want another minute to try and
think through this or you're

2664
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:47,920
think through this or you're
 

2665
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,910
think through this or you're
no? How many how many people want a

2666
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:49,920
no? How many how many people want a
 

2667
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,190
no? How many how many people want a
minute or how many people are just want

2668
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,200
minute or how many people are just want
 

2669
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:57,910
minute or how many people are just want
to or how many people are totally lost?

2670
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920

 

2671
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,829

>> Yes. Could you explain how did you get

2672
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:01,839
>> Yes. Could you explain how did you get
 

2673
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:05,109
>> Yes. Could you explain how did you get
the exponential

2674
01:08:05,109 --> 01:08:05,119

 

2675
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:05,910

>> here?

2676
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:05,920
>> here?
 

2677
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,870
>> here?
>> Yes.

2678
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:06,880
>> Yes.
 

2679
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,230
>> Yes.
>> This is basically coming from

2680
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:10,240
>> This is basically coming from
 

2681
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,470
>> This is basically coming from
uh this part. So it's just the

2682
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:12,480
uh this part. So it's just the
 

2683
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,029
uh this part. So it's just the
exponential response x dot equal to uh

2684
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:15,039
exponential response x dot equal to uh
 

2685
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,070
exponential response x dot equal to uh
ax will give you just an exponential

2686
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:18,080
ax will give you just an exponential
 

2687
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,910
ax will give you just an exponential
and then this is giving you an impulse

2688
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:19,920
and then this is giving you an impulse
 

2689
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:30,550
and then this is giving you an impulse
response which is giving you this part.

2690
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:30,560

 

2691
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,630

Okay, let's go through this together

2692
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:32,640
Okay, let's go through this together
 

2693
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,229
Okay, let's go through this together
since I'm not seeing anyone doing any

2694
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:34,239
since I'm not seeing anyone doing any
 

2695
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:36,870
since I'm not seeing anyone doing any
writing then I'm not sure. No one's ask

2696
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:36,880
writing then I'm not sure. No one's ask
 

2697
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:41,510
writing then I'm not sure. No one's ask
any questions either. Okay,

2698
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:41,520

 

2699
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,349

so let's assume that a is less than zero

2700
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:43,359
so let's assume that a is less than zero
 

2701
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,149
so let's assume that a is less than zero
so that no one's blowing up anywhere.

2702
01:08:46,149 --> 01:08:46,159
so that no one's blowing up anywhere.
 

2703
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:48,470
so that no one's blowing up anywhere.
Now let's look at this right. So if I

2704
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:48,480
Now let's look at this right. So if I
 

2705
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:52,630
Now let's look at this right. So if I
have my delta t is very close to zero

2706
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
have my delta t is very close to zero
 

2707
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,110
have my delta t is very close to zero
then e to the a delta t is basically

2708
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:55,120
then e to the a delta t is basically
 

2709
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,070
then e to the a delta t is basically
like one. And so what does this mean for

2710
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,080
like one. And so what does this mean for
 

2711
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,269
like one. And so what does this mean for
my initial state?

2712
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:01,279
my initial state?
 

2713
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,870
my initial state?
If this coefficient is like one

2714
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:04,880
If this coefficient is like one
 

2715
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,510
If this coefficient is like one
am I keeping my history

2716
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
am I keeping my history
 

2717
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,990
am I keeping my history
or am I losing my history?

2718
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:12,000
or am I losing my history?
 

2719
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,430
or am I losing my history?
>> I'm keeping it right. I'm not really uh

2720
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:15,440
>> I'm keeping it right. I'm not really uh
 

2721
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,950
>> I'm keeping it right. I'm not really uh
yeah I'm not I'm not forgetting it at

2722
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:16,960
yeah I'm not I'm not forgetting it at
 

2723
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,510
yeah I'm not I'm not forgetting it at
all. So this means that I basically you

2724
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:19,520
all. So this means that I basically you
 

2725
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,110
all. So this means that I basically you
know

2726
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:21,120
know
 

2727
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:27,829
know
remember history.

2728
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:27,839

 

2729
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:32,550

But if delta t was fairly large that

2730
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:32,560
But if delta t was fairly large that
 

2731
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,149
But if delta t was fairly large that
means that this is a decaying

2732
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:34,159
means that this is a decaying
 

2733
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:36,709
means that this is a decaying
exponential because a is negative and

2734
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:36,719
exponential because a is negative and
 

2735
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,829
exponential because a is negative and
the larger delta t is the faster I'm

2736
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
the larger delta t is the faster I'm
 

2737
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:43,269
the larger delta t is the faster I'm
forgetting my past. Right? So this is

2738
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:43,279
forgetting my past. Right? So this is
 

2739
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:51,430
forgetting my past. Right? So this is
saying forget my past.

2740
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:51,440

 

2741
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,870

What about this other term? What about

2742
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:52,880
What about this other term? What about
 

2743
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,870
What about this other term? What about
this impact of the input here?

2744
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:56,880
this impact of the input here?
 

2745
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,510
this impact of the input here?
So here to see what's happening here,

2746
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:01,520
So here to see what's happening here,
 

2747
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,510
So here to see what's happening here,
let's use the tailor expansion of this

2748
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:03,520
let's use the tailor expansion of this
 

2749
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,030
let's use the tailor expansion of this
quantity e to the a delta t minus one.

2750
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:07,040
quantity e to the a delta t minus one.
 

2751
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,510
quantity e to the a delta t minus one.
Let's say delta t is smallish that we

2752
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:09,520
Let's say delta t is smallish that we
 

2753
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,550
Let's say delta t is smallish that we
can actually use the tailor expansion.

2754
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:12,560
can actually use the tailor expansion.
 

2755
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,630
can actually use the tailor expansion.
But then I have e to the x is basically

2756
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:14,640
But then I have e to the x is basically
 

2757
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,470
But then I have e to the x is basically
1 plus x, right? That's my tailor

2758
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:16,480
1 plus x, right? That's my tailor
 

2759
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,990
1 plus x, right? That's my tailor
expansion. So I can rewrite this as 1

2760
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:18,000
expansion. So I can rewrite this as 1
 

2761
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,310
expansion. So I can rewrite this as 1
plus x - 1. So this is approximately a

2762
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:20,320
plus x - 1. So this is approximately a
 

2763
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,470
plus x - 1. So this is approximately a
delta t

2764
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:22,480
delta t
 

2765
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,950
delta t
multiply it by the b / a. And then I get

2766
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:24,960
multiply it by the b / a. And then I get
 

2767
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,350
multiply it by the b / a. And then I get
this b delta t.

2768
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:29,360

 

2769
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,430

And now again here if delta t is very

2770
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:31,440
And now again here if delta t is very
 

2771
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,430
And now again here if delta t is very
close to zero,

2772
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:33,440
close to zero,
 

2773
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,910
close to zero,
b delta t is

2774
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:35,920
b delta t is
 

2775
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,550
b delta t is
close to zero. So does that mean is the

2776
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:38,560
close to zero. So does that mean is the
 

2777
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,149
close to zero. So does that mean is the
effect of the input high or the effect

2778
01:10:40,149 --> 01:10:40,159
effect of the input high or the effect
 

2779
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,390
effect of the input high or the effect
of input low? Like input doesn't matter

2780
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:42,400
of input low? Like input doesn't matter
 

2781
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:49,590
of input low? Like input doesn't matter
much, right?

2782
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:49,600

 

2783
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,910

But if delta t is very large then the

2784
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:51,920
But if delta t is very large then the
 

2785
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:59,590
But if delta t is very large then the
input matters a lot.

2786
01:10:59,590 --> 01:10:59,600

 

2787
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,669

So basically

2788
01:11:01,669 --> 01:11:01,679
So basically
 

2789
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:05,030
So basically
by changing the value of delta t by

2790
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:05,040
by changing the value of delta t by
 

2791
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,149
by changing the value of delta t by
dialing this up and down I can decide

2792
01:11:08,149 --> 01:11:08,159
dialing this up and down I can decide
 

2793
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:11,669
dialing this up and down I can decide
whether I care more about the current

2794
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:11,679
whether I care more about the current
 

2795
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:16,070
whether I care more about the current
state or I care more about the history.

2796
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:16,080
state or I care more about the history.
 

2797
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:20,709
state or I care more about the history.
Right? This is a knob that I have

2798
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:20,719

 

2799
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:28,790

that can allow me to tweak things. Okay.

2800
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:28,800

 

2801
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,709

So what do you do with a knob? You're in

2802
01:11:30,709 --> 01:11:30,719
So what do you do with a knob? You're in
 

2803
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,590
So what do you do with a knob? You're in
a deep learning class.

2804
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:33,600
a deep learning class.
 

2805
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,189
a deep learning class.
You tune it, right? You train the

2806
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:35,199
You tune it, right? You train the
 

2807
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,590
You tune it, right? You train the
parameter. So we've seen that basically

2808
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
parameter. So we've seen that basically
 

2809
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,189
parameter. So we've seen that basically
by changing this delta t,

2810
01:11:41,189 --> 01:11:41,199
by changing this delta t,
 

2811
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,430
by changing this delta t,
we can choose what we want to keep in

2812
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:43,440
we can choose what we want to keep in
 

2813
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,110
we can choose what we want to keep in
memory and what we don't want to keep in

2814
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:45,120
memory and what we don't want to keep in
 

2815
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:49,270
memory and what we don't want to keep in
memory in some sense, right?

2816
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:49,280
memory in some sense, right?
 

2817
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,630
memory in some sense, right?
And remember, we're doing this on a

2818
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:50,640
And remember, we're doing this on a
 

2819
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,669
And remember, we're doing this on a
channelby channel basis. And so we can

2820
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:53,679
channelby channel basis. And so we can
 

2821
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:55,750
channelby channel basis. And so we can
have

2822
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:55,760
have
 

2823
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,630
have
different channels having this different

2824
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:00,640
different channels having this different
 

2825
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,470
different channels having this different
different delta t's and therefore you

2826
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:02,480
different delta t's and therefore you
 

2827
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,149
different delta t's and therefore you
can remember some channels more you can

2828
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:04,159
can remember some channels more you can
 

2829
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,229
can remember some channels more you can
remember other channels less and you can

2830
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
remember other channels less and you can
 

2831
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,910
remember other channels less and you can
collect information into certain

2832
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:07,920
collect information into certain
 

2833
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,550
collect information into certain
channels that will have the history and

2834
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:10,560
channels that will have the history and
 

2835
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,390
channels that will have the history and
you can collect information into other

2836
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:12,400
you can collect information into other
 

2837
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,229
you can collect information into other
channels that is more based on the

2838
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:14,239
channels that is more based on the
 

2839
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:17,350
channels that is more based on the
current information or current state or

2840
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:17,360
current information or current state or
 

2841
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,709
current information or current state or
current input. Right? So because we're

2842
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:20,719
current input. Right? So because we're
 

2843
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:23,189
current input. Right? So because we're
we we you know we're following the S4

2844
01:12:23,189 --> 01:12:23,199
we we you know we're following the S4
 

2845
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,669
we we you know we're following the S4
architecture of of having these

2846
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:25,679
architecture of of having these
 

2847
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,149
architecture of of having these
depthwise convolutions. So we're not

2848
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:28,159
depthwise convolutions. So we're not
 

2849
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,149
depthwise convolutions. So we're not
going to be mixing channels and so we

2850
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:30,159
going to be mixing channels and so we
 

2851
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:32,149
going to be mixing channels and so we
can have different parameters for

2852
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:32,159
can have different parameters for
 

2853
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,630
can have different parameters for
different channels and bring the

2854
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:34,640
different channels and bring the
 

2855
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,430
different channels and bring the
selectivity that is one of the S6 SS

2856
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
selectivity that is one of the S6 SS
 

2857
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,510
selectivity that is one of the S6 SS
um

2858
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:41,520
um
 

2859
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,709
um
into our system to increase its

2860
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:44,719
into our system to increase its
 

2861
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:47,750
into our system to increase its
performance.

2862
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:47,760

 

2863
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,470

Okay.

2864
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:50,480
Okay.
 

2865
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,910
Okay.
So what we're going to do is we're

2866
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:51,920
So what we're going to do is we're
 

2867
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,830
So what we're going to do is we're
basically choose delta t based on our

2868
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:53,840
basically choose delta t based on our
 

2869
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,189
basically choose delta t based on our
input. We're going to learn it. So how

2870
01:12:57,189 --> 01:12:57,199
input. We're going to learn it. So how
 

2871
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:00,070
input. We're going to learn it. So how
would we learn it? Well

2872
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:00,080
would we learn it? Well
 

2873
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,709
would we learn it? Well
the natural thing to try is to say well

2874
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:02,719
the natural thing to try is to say well
 

2875
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,310
the natural thing to try is to say well
can we come you know put in a linear

2876
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:04,320
can we come you know put in a linear
 

2877
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,709
can we come you know put in a linear
layer and see what you can get. So you

2878
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:06,719
layer and see what you can get. So you
 

2879
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,149
layer and see what you can get. So you
have you want to now depend on the

2880
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:08,159
have you want to now depend on the
 

2881
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,590
have you want to now depend on the
entire U. You don't want to depend just

2882
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:09,600
entire U. You don't want to depend just
 

2883
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,189
entire U. You don't want to depend just
on the channel by channel U but you want

2884
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:11,199
on the channel by channel U but you want
 

2885
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,750
on the channel by channel U but you want
to look at your entire input U or X.

2886
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:13,760
to look at your entire input U or X.
 

2887
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,149
to look at your entire input U or X.
let's call it x input x and you want to

2888
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:16,159
let's call it x input x and you want to
 

2889
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,950
let's call it x input x and you want to
say looking at this entire sequence well

2890
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:18,960
say looking at this entire sequence well
 

2891
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,270
say looking at this entire sequence well
how do I want to be thinking about um

2892
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:23,280
how do I want to be thinking about um
 

2893
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,709
how do I want to be thinking about um
thinking about what this delta t should

2894
01:13:24,709 --> 01:13:24,719
thinking about what this delta t should
 

2895
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,510
thinking about what this delta t should
be so let me try a linear layer and see

2896
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:27,520
be so let me try a linear layer and see
 

2897
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,270
be so let me try a linear layer and see
what I can do so does a linear layer

2898
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:29,280
what I can do so does a linear layer
 

2899
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,390
what I can do so does a linear layer
work or maybe why don't you think about

2900
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:30,400
work or maybe why don't you think about
 

2901
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,750
work or maybe why don't you think about
this for a minute or just digest this

2902
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:31,760
this for a minute or just digest this
 

2903
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,590
this for a minute or just digest this
for a minute talk about something or try

2904
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:33,600
for a minute talk about something or try
 

2905
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,590
for a minute talk about something or try
to talk about how could we possibly go

2906
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
to talk about how could we possibly go
 

2907
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,070
to talk about how could we possibly go
about learning this delta t yeah take a

2908
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:38,080
about learning this delta t yeah take a
 

2909
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,110
about learning this delta t yeah take a
minute and if you have a question in

2910
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:39,120
minute and if you have a question in
 

2911
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,910
minute and if you have a question in
that minute also ask me

2912
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
that minute also ask me
 

2913
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:52,630
that minute also ask me
>> can you scroll up just to show

2914
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:52,640

 

2915
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,229

I'll just pause

2916
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:56,239

 

2917
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,470

if you everything is clear. Spend time

2918
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:58,480
if you everything is clear. Spend time
 

2919
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,189
if you everything is clear. Spend time
thinking about how could I, you know,

2920
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:01,199
thinking about how could I, you know,
 

2921
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:03,189
thinking about how could I, you know,
learn what this delta t is based on my

2922
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:03,199
learn what this delta t is based on my
 

2923
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:05,110
learn what this delta t is based on my
input u uh input. Let me actually call

2924
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:05,120
input u uh input. Let me actually call
 

2925
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:14,149
input u uh input. Let me actually call
this input x.

2926
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:14,159

 

2927
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:29,510

Uh, no, never mind.

2928
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:29,520

 

2929
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:37,669

>> Yes.

2930
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:37,679

 

2931
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,750

>> Yes. Why would we choose Why would we

2932
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:39,760
>> Yes. Why would we choose Why would we
 

2933
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,550
>> Yes. Why would we choose Why would we
choose like delta t to be

2934
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:42,560
choose like delta t to be
 

2935
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,229
choose like delta t to be
>> ah okay so here's a great question that

2936
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:44,239
>> ah okay so here's a great question that
 

2937
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,550
>> ah okay so here's a great question that
I should answer to everyone so the

2938
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
I should answer to everyone so the
 

2939
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,070
I should answer to everyone so the
question was why wouldn't we choose

2940
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,080
question was why wouldn't we choose
 

2941
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,870
question was why wouldn't we choose
delta t to be the nyquis rate right

2942
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
delta t to be the nyquis rate right
 

2943
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,270
delta t to be the nyquis rate right
because so if we chose delta to be the

2944
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:53,280
because so if we chose delta to be the
 

2945
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,870
because so if we chose delta to be the
what is the nyquis rate saying for those

2946
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:54,880
what is the nyquis rate saying for those
 

2947
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,149
what is the nyquis rate saying for those
of you who have signal processing

2948
01:14:56,149 --> 01:14:56,159
of you who have signal processing
 

2949
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,630
of you who have signal processing
background it's basically saying that

2950
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:58,640
background it's basically saying that
 

2951
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,149
background it's basically saying that
well if you're faster than the if you're

2952
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
well if you're faster than the if you're
 

2953
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,990
well if you're faster than the if you're
twice as fast as the largest frequency

2954
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,000
twice as fast as the largest frequency
 

2955
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,270
twice as fast as the largest frequency
then you're going to keep all of your

2956
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:05,280
then you're going to keep all of your
 

2957
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,510
then you're going to keep all of your
information but that's the whole point

2958
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:07,520
information but that's the whole point
 

2959
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,189
information but that's the whole point
right you might not want to keep all of

2960
01:15:09,189 --> 01:15:09,199
right you might not want to keep all of
 

2961
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,030
right you might not want to keep all of
your information. You might want to

2962
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:11,040
your information. You might want to
 

2963
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,149
your information. You might want to
forget some of it.

2964
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:14,159
forget some of it.
 

2965
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,390
forget some of it.
So

2966
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:16,400
So
 

2967
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,470
So
big delta t's allow you to forget

2968
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:18,480
big delta t's allow you to forget
 

2969
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,430
big delta t's allow you to forget
information. You can see that

2970
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:19,440
information. You can see that
 

2971
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,430
information. You can see that
pictorially as well.

2972
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:23,440

 

2973
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:56,790

Make sense?

2974
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:56,800

 

2975
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,709

Okay. So, let's just think through this

2976
01:15:58,709 --> 01:15:58,719
Okay. So, let's just think through this
 

2977
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,390
Okay. So, let's just think through this
together in the interest of time and

2978
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,400
together in the interest of time and
 

2979
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,750
together in the interest of time and
getting through the rest of what I want

2980
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:01,760
getting through the rest of what I want
 

2981
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,630
getting through the rest of what I want
to get through.

2982
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:06,640

 

2983
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,189

So if I wanted to learn this, a natural

2984
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:09,199
So if I wanted to learn this, a natural
 

2985
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:12,709
So if I wanted to learn this, a natural
thing to try might be to say let me do a

2986
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:12,719
thing to try might be to say let me do a
 

2987
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:14,390
thing to try might be to say let me do a
linear layer. I can just think of this

2988
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400
linear layer. I can just think of this
 

2989
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,310
linear layer. I can just think of this
linear layer as some inner product of

2990
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:16,320
linear layer as some inner product of
 

2991
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,550
linear layer as some inner product of
some vector W

2992
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:18,560
some vector W
 

2993
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,110
some vector W
with some U. Right? Can I just try

2994
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:21,120
with some U. Right? Can I just try
 

2995
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,229
with some U. Right? Can I just try
learning a linear function of U?

2996
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:24,239
learning a linear function of U?
 

2997
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:27,750
learning a linear function of U?
What's the problem with this

2998
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:27,760
What's the problem with this
 

2999
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,189
What's the problem with this
particular approach? Is there a problem?

3000
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:29,199
particular approach? Is there a problem?
 

3001
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:42,149
particular approach? Is there a problem?
Does this work?

3002
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:42,159

 

3003
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:49,030

What is delta t representing?

3004
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,040

 

3005
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,790

It's a time step, right? So it's my

3006
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:50,800
It's a time step, right? So it's my
 

3007
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,550
It's a time step, right? So it's my
sampling interval. What is a what is a

3008
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:54,560
sampling interval. What is a what is a
 

3009
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:59,510
sampling interval. What is a what is a
sampling interval of minus3?

3010
01:16:59,510 --> 01:16:59,520

 

3011
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,030

It doesn't really make any sense, right?

3012
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,040
It doesn't really make any sense, right?
 

3013
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,189
It doesn't really make any sense, right?
Like so if this inner product and what

3014
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:03,199
Like so if this inner product and what
 

3015
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:04,470
Like so if this inner product and what
is the inner product? The inner product

3016
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,480
is the inner product? The inner product
 

3017
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,990
is the inner product? The inner product
can be any real value. It can be

3018
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:06,000
can be any real value. It can be
 

3019
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,510
can be any real value. It can be
positive, it can be negative, it can be

3020
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:07,520
positive, it can be negative, it can be
 

3021
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,990
positive, it can be negative, it can be
whatever. So I don't like it because it

3022
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,000
whatever. So I don't like it because it
 

3023
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,149
whatever. So I don't like it because it
can give me a time step of -3 and then I

3024
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:12,159
can give me a time step of -3 and then I
 

3025
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:15,030
can give me a time step of -3 and then I
don't know what to do with that. Okay.

3026
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:15,040
don't know what to do with that. Okay.
 

3027
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,870
don't know what to do with that. Okay.
So I want something I want to learn

3028
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:16,880
So I want something I want to learn
 

3029
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,790
So I want something I want to learn
something in a way that forces it to be

3030
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:18,800
something in a way that forces it to be
 

3031
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,470
something in a way that forces it to be
positive

3032
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:20,480
positive
 

3033
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,550
positive
so that I can basically do something

3034
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:22,560
so that I can basically do something
 

3035
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,669
so that I can basically do something
with it. Um so the norm is one way to do

3036
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:25,679
with it. Um so the norm is one way to do
 

3037
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,750
with it. Um so the norm is one way to do
it. But what's a standard thing that we

3038
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:27,760
it. But what's a standard thing that we
 

3039
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,790
it. But what's a standard thing that we
always do like we're again like throw

3040
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:30,800
always do like we're again like throw
 

3041
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,950
always do like we're again like throw
out your control theory hat but put on

3042
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:32,960
out your control theory hat but put on
 

3043
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,430
out your control theory hat but put on
your deep learning hat and you want to

3044
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:35,440
your deep learning hat and you want to
 

3045
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,110
your deep learning hat and you want to
force something to be positive in a deep

3046
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:37,120
force something to be positive in a deep
 

3047
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,910
force something to be positive in a deep
learning class. What do you do?

3048
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:39,920
learning class. What do you do?
 

3049
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,510
learning class. What do you do?
you can try to do some kind of

3050
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:41,520
you can try to do some kind of
 

3051
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:46,709
you can try to do some kind of
nonlinearity or or or or relu right

3052
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:46,719
nonlinearity or or or or relu right
 

3053
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,790
nonlinearity or or or or relu right
so um yeah so the natural next try is to

3054
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:50,800
so um yeah so the natural next try is to
 

3055
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,110
so um yeah so the natural next try is to
say well

3056
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:53,120
say well
 

3057
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,990
say well
I can do a relu

3058
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:56,000
I can do a relu
 

3059
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,830
I can do a relu
of let's say

3060
01:17:59,830 --> 01:17:59,840
of let's say
 

3061
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:07,030
of let's say
let me bias or not a vector

3062
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:07,040

 

3063
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,709

okay

3064
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:08,719
okay
 

3065
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,550
okay
The problem with this is that this

3066
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:10,560
The problem with this is that this
 

3067
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,750
The problem with this is that this
works, but the relu is zero very often.

3068
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:15,760
works, but the relu is zero very often.
 

3069
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,430
works, but the relu is zero very often.
And so that's not something you really

3070
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:17,440
And so that's not something you really
 

3071
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,390
And so that's not something you really
want either. Um, and so what ends up

3072
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:20,400
want either. Um, and so what ends up
 

3073
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,149
want either. Um, and so what ends up
working really well is this thing called

3074
01:18:22,149 --> 01:18:22,159
working really well is this thing called
 

3075
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:24,709
working really well is this thing called
the soft plus,

3076
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:24,719
the soft plus,
 

3077
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:26,870
the soft plus,
which is basically like the relu, but

3078
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:26,880
which is basically like the relu, but
 

3079
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,310
which is basically like the relu, but
it's a bit smoother.

3080
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:30,320
it's a bit smoother.
 

3081
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,390
it's a bit smoother.
Uh, and it has some properties that are

3082
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:32,400
Uh, and it has some properties that are
 

3083
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,310
Uh, and it has some properties that are
sometimes beneficial. So it's the log of

3084
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:34,320
sometimes beneficial. So it's the log of
 

3085
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,830
sometimes beneficial. So it's the log of
1 plus e to the x. and this blue curve.

3086
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:37,840
1 plus e to the x. and this blue curve.
 

3087
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,510
1 plus e to the x. and this blue curve.
So the red is the relu and this blue

3088
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:39,520
So the red is the relu and this blue
 

3089
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,790
So the red is the relu and this blue
curve is what the the soft plus is. And

3090
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:42,800
curve is what the the soft plus is. And
 

3091
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,630
curve is what the the soft plus is. And
so instead of setting hard to zero, it's

3092
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:44,640
so instead of setting hard to zero, it's
 

3093
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,669
so instead of setting hard to zero, it's
kind of slowly going to zero and it's

3094
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:47,679
kind of slowly going to zero and it's
 

3095
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,709
kind of slowly going to zero and it's
giving you these really large delta t's

3096
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:50,719
giving you these really large delta t's
 

3097
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,470
giving you these really large delta t's
if you want or you can have these really

3098
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:52,480
if you want or you can have these really
 

3099
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,709
if you want or you can have these really
small delta t's. Okay.

3100
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:56,719
small delta t's. Okay.
 

3101
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,189
small delta t's. Okay.
And so basically with this what you can

3102
01:18:59,189 --> 01:18:59,199
And so basically with this what you can
 

3103
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,870
And so basically with this what you can
do

3104
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:00,880
do
 

3105
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,030
do
is you know if you if you ignore all of

3106
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:03,040
is you know if you if you ignore all of
 

3107
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,030
is you know if you if you ignore all of
your learnable parameters for a minute

3108
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:05,040
your learnable parameters for a minute
 

3109
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,430
your learnable parameters for a minute
just uh you know you just think of a

3110
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:07,440
just uh you know you just think of a
 

3111
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,470
just uh you know you just think of a
scalar case and you set a and b to one

3112
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:10,480
scalar case and you set a and b to one
 

3113
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,110
scalar case and you set a and b to one
then you can think of this as well I'm

3114
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:13,120
then you can think of this as well I'm
 

3115
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,910
then you can think of this as well I'm
learning some function

3116
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:15,920
learning some function
 

3117
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,790
learning some function
based on my input that is telling me how

3118
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:18,800
based on my input that is telling me how
 

3119
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,229
based on my input that is telling me how
much do I want to weight the history

3120
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:22,239
much do I want to weight the history
 

3121
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:24,149
much do I want to weight the history
versus how do I want to weight my

3122
01:19:24,149 --> 01:19:24,159
versus how do I want to weight my
 

3123
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,950
versus how do I want to weight my
current input. Okay, this is something

3124
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:26,960
current input. Okay, this is something
 

3125
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,990
current input. Okay, this is something
that I can learn.

3126
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:32,000

 

3127
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,950

Um,

3128
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:34,960
Um,
 

3129
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,709
Um,
okay.

3130
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:38,719

 

3131
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:39,910

And this is something I just want to

3132
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:39,920
And this is something I just want to
 

3133
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,510
And this is something I just want to
write this in this form because you've

3134
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:41,520
write this in this form because you've
 

3135
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,910
write this in this form because you've
seen this form before, right? We've seen

3136
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:43,920
seen this form before, right? We've seen
 

3137
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,590
seen this form before, right? We've seen
this in momentum. We've seen this like

3138
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:45,600
this in momentum. We've seen this like
 

3139
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,590
this in momentum. We've seen this like
you have an intuition about what happens

3140
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:47,600
you have an intuition about what happens
 

3141
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,590
you have an intuition about what happens
when things look like this. But this is

3142
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:49,600
when things look like this. But this is
 

3143
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,270
when things look like this. But this is
essentially

3144
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:51,280
essentially
 

3145
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,870
essentially
it's the same kind of thing. It's not

3146
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:52,880
it's the same kind of thing. It's not
 

3147
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,310
it's the same kind of thing. It's not
exactly the same thing, but it's the

3148
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:54,320
exactly the same thing, but it's the
 

3149
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,669
exactly the same thing, but it's the
same kind of thing that's happening

3150
01:19:55,669 --> 01:19:55,679
same kind of thing that's happening
 

3151
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,590
same kind of thing that's happening
here,

3152
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:57,600
here,
 

3153
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,030
here,
right? There's a trade-off between these

3154
01:19:59,030 --> 01:19:59,040
right? There's a trade-off between these
 

3155
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,550
right? There's a trade-off between these
two parameters. They don't necessarily

3156
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:00,560
two parameters. They don't necessarily
 

3157
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,870
two parameters. They don't necessarily
sum to one, but there is uh you can you

3158
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:04,880
sum to one, but there is uh you can you
 

3159
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,870
sum to one, but there is uh you can you
can tw you can tune each of these uh

3160
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:06,880
can tw you can tune each of these uh
 

3161
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,550
can tw you can tune each of these uh
each of these parameters. It's important

3162
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:08,560
each of these parameters. It's important
 

3163
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,990
each of these parameters. It's important
to remember here that these parameters

3164
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:10,000
to remember here that these parameters
 

3165
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,310
to remember here that these parameters
AB are all learnable, right? So, it's

3166
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:12,320
AB are all learnable, right? So, it's
 

3167
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,950
AB are all learnable, right? So, it's
not exactly the same, but it's just an

3168
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:14,960
not exactly the same, but it's just an
 

3169
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,950
not exactly the same, but it's just an
intuition that you can build.

3170
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:18,960

 

3171
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,590

Okay.

3172
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:21,600
Okay.
 

3173
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,270
Okay.
So

3174
01:20:23,270 --> 01:20:23,280
So
 

3175
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,149
So
what this does is now we can say that

3176
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:26,159
what this does is now we can say that
 

3177
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,430
what this does is now we can say that
okay we can now choose this delta t we

3178
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:29,440
okay we can now choose this delta t we
 

3179
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,830
okay we can now choose this delta t we
can learn this delta t and with by

3180
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:31,840
can learn this delta t and with by
 

3181
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,830
can learn this delta t and with by
learning this delta t based on our

3182
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:33,840
learning this delta t based on our
 

3183
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,669
learning this delta t based on our
different inputs.

3184
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:35,679
different inputs.
 

3185
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:38,630
different inputs.
We can have

3186
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:38,640
We can have
 

3187
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:43,830
We can have
an a k and a bk and maybe even a ck for

3188
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:43,840
an a k and a bk and maybe even a ck for
 

3189
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,430
an a k and a bk and maybe even a ck for
each of these. In practice, in the S6

3190
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:45,440
each of these. In practice, in the S6
 

3191
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,110
each of these. In practice, in the S6
models, they actually don't learn the

3192
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:47,120
models, they actually don't learn the
 

3193
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,550
models, they actually don't learn the
CK, which is why I didn't write this

3194
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:48,560
CK, which is why I didn't write this
 

3195
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,910
CK, which is why I didn't write this
here. But you now see that theoretically

3196
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:51,920
here. But you now see that theoretically
 

3197
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,950
here. But you now see that theoretically
you can learn different

3198
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:54,960
you can learn different
 

3199
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,350
you can learn different
waiting matrices

3200
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:57,360
waiting matrices
 

3201
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,830
waiting matrices
for different inputs and therefore you

3202
01:20:59,830 --> 01:20:59,840
for different inputs and therefore you
 

3203
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,590
for different inputs and therefore you
can say that you know for this input I

3204
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:01,600
can say that you know for this input I
 

3205
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,030
can say that you know for this input I
want to behave this way, for this other

3206
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:03,040
want to behave this way, for this other
 

3207
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,950
want to behave this way, for this other
input I want to behave this way, so on

3208
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:04,960
input I want to behave this way, so on
 

3209
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,669
input I want to behave this way, so on
and so forth.

3210
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:07,679
and so forth.
 

3211
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,990
and so forth.
Does everyone see how this selectivity

3212
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:10,000
Does everyone see how this selectivity
 

3213
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,669
Does everyone see how this selectivity
is being obtained by choosing and

3214
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:13,679
is being obtained by choosing and
 

3215
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,149
is being obtained by choosing and
learning this delta t parameter? Okay.

3216
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:16,159
learning this delta t parameter? Okay.
 

3217
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:17,990
learning this delta t parameter? Okay.
And we're not like using the continuous

3218
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:18,000
And we're not like using the continuous
 

3219
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,910
And we're not like using the continuous
time system here per se. We're just

3220
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:19,920
time system here per se. We're just
 

3221
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,070
time system here per se. We're just
using it as a inspiration and a

3222
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:22,080
using it as a inspiration and a
 

3223
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,390
using it as a inspiration and a
motivation to set this up to be able to

3224
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:24,400
motivation to set this up to be able to
 

3225
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,149
motivation to set this up to be able to
learn these things and have this

3226
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:26,159
learn these things and have this
 

3227
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,149
learn these things and have this
selectivity that helps us then remember

3228
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:28,159
selectivity that helps us then remember
 

3229
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:29,910
selectivity that helps us then remember
think about what should be in memory and

3230
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:29,920
think about what should be in memory and
 

3231
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,270
think about what should be in memory and
what should not be in memory or what

3232
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:31,280
what should not be in memory or what
 

3233
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,709
what should not be in memory or what
should be in our history in our state

3234
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:32,719
should be in our history in our state
 

3235
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:33,910
should be in our history in our state
and what should not be in our hidden

3236
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:33,920
and what should not be in our hidden
 

3237
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,669
and what should not be in our hidden
state.

3238
01:21:35,669 --> 01:21:35,679
state.
 

3239
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,350
state.
But have we lost anything in this

3240
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:37,360
But have we lost anything in this
 

3241
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:42,709
But have we lost anything in this
process now? Yes. Question.

3242
01:21:42,709 --> 01:21:42,719

 

3243
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:44,470

>> Yes. Exactly. Right. So suddenly our

3244
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:44,480
>> Yes. Exactly. Right. So suddenly our
 

3245
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,149
>> Yes. Exactly. Right. So suddenly our
system is now time varying and we spend

3246
01:21:46,149 --> 01:21:46,159
system is now time varying and we spend
 

3247
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,709
system is now time varying and we spend
all this time talking about all this

3248
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:48,719
all this time talking about all this
 

3249
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,790
all this time talking about all this
fast for transform stuff. But that only

3250
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:50,800
fast for transform stuff. But that only
 

3251
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,629
fast for transform stuff. But that only
works for LTI systems.

3252
01:21:54,629 --> 01:21:54,639
works for LTI systems.
 

3253
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,470
works for LTI systems.
So what are we what is the what are we

3254
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:56,480
So what are we what is the what are we
 

3255
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,070
So what are we what is the what are we
going to do now? Turns out that you can

3256
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:00,080
going to do now? Turns out that you can
 

3257
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,390
going to do now? Turns out that you can
still do the unrolling of the system in

3258
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:02,400
still do the unrolling of the system in
 

3259
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,350
still do the unrolling of the system in
the exact same way. So here now instead

3260
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:05,360
the exact same way. So here now instead
 

3261
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,910
the exact same way. So here now instead
of having terms

3262
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:07,920
of having terms
 

3263
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,510
of having terms
um

3264
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:09,520
um
 

3265
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,790
um
that are like a to the k that's going to

3266
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:12,800
that are like a to the k that's going to
 

3267
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,229
that are like a to the k that's going to
be replaced with something like a the k

3268
01:22:16,229 --> 01:22:16,239
be replaced with something like a the k
 

3269
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:20,390
be replaced with something like a the k
* a the k minus one * a1 * a kn because

3270
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:20,400
* a the k minus one * a1 * a kn because
 

3271
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,070
* a the k minus one * a1 * a kn because
I'm going to have all these distinct

3272
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:22,080
I'm going to have all these distinct
 

3273
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,550
I'm going to have all these distinct
matrices but I can still do the

3274
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:24,560
matrices but I can still do the
 

3275
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,790
matrices but I can still do the
unrolling in the exact same way it turns

3276
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:26,800
unrolling in the exact same way it turns
 

3277
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:31,110
unrolling in the exact same way it turns
out. And so I can still have y of t as a

3278
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:31,120
out. And so I can still have y of t as a
 

3279
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:35,030
out. And so I can still have y of t as a
linear function of all of my inputs,

3280
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:35,040
linear function of all of my inputs,
 

3281
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,910
linear function of all of my inputs,
right? And because I've eliminated the

3282
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:37,920
right? And because I've eliminated the
 

3283
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:41,350
right? And because I've eliminated the
horizontal nonlinearity,

3284
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:41,360
horizontal nonlinearity,
 

3285
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:45,189
horizontal nonlinearity,
I can still process this fundamentally

3286
01:22:45,189 --> 01:22:45,199
I can still process this fundamentally
 

3287
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,669
I can still process this fundamentally
in the same parallelizable way. It won't

3288
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:47,679
in the same parallelizable way. It won't
 

3289
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:50,229
in the same parallelizable way. It won't
be the convolution. I won't be uh uh I

3290
01:22:50,229 --> 01:22:50,239
be the convolution. I won't be uh uh I
 

3291
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:52,870
be the convolution. I won't be uh uh I
won't be able to do the fft trick on it

3292
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:52,880
won't be able to do the fft trick on it
 

3293
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,270
won't be able to do the fft trick on it
and it will become an order t operation,

3294
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:55,280
and it will become an order t operation,
 

3295
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,390
and it will become an order t operation,
not an a t log t operation. But it is

3296
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:58,400
not an a t log t operation. But it is
 

3297
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,510
not an a t log t operation. But it is
still parallelizable. Okay.

3298
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:01,520
still parallelizable. Okay.
 

3299
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,189
still parallelizable. Okay.
Uh if you want you can read lots of work

3300
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:05,199
Uh if you want you can read lots of work
 

3301
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:07,430
Uh if you want you can read lots of work
on exactly how this parallelization is

3302
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:07,440
on exactly how this parallelization is
 

3303
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,110
on exactly how this parallelization is
done. But the key thing that you need

3304
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:09,120
done. But the key thing that you need
 

3305
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,910
done. But the key thing that you need
that I want to communicate is that it

3306
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:11,920
that I want to communicate is that it
 

3307
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,669
that I want to communicate is that it
can be done parallelly and you don't

3308
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:13,679
can be done parallelly and you don't
 

3309
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:16,149
can be done parallelly and you don't
have the serial bottleneck that the RNN

3310
01:23:16,149 --> 01:23:16,159
have the serial bottleneck that the RNN
 

3311
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:19,750
have the serial bottleneck that the RNN
has. Okay.

3312
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:19,760
has. Okay.
 

3313
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,590
has. Okay.
So that's really what I wanted to get to

3314
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:21,600
So that's really what I wanted to get to
 

3315
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,310
So that's really what I wanted to get to
today. There's another small point which

3316
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:24,320
today. There's another small point which
 

3317
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,350
today. There's another small point which
is that um how do you now initialize for

3318
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:27,360
is that um how do you now initialize for
 

3319
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,629
is that um how do you now initialize for
these S6 models and there is a a couple

3320
01:23:30,629 --> 01:23:30,639
these S6 models and there is a a couple
 

3321
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:33,590
these S6 models and there is a a couple
of initializations that work.

3322
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,600
of initializations that work.
 

3323
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,550
of initializations that work.
It turns out that the reliance on it's

3324
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:36,560
It turns out that the reliance on it's
 

3325
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,629
It turns out that the reliance on it's
it's still the complex initialization

3326
01:23:38,629 --> 01:23:38,639
it's still the complex initialization
 

3327
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,590
it's still the complex initialization
still help for this but they're less

3328
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:41,600
still help for this but they're less
 

3329
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,550
still help for this but they're less
critical. Um and you can really stick to

3330
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:44,560
critical. Um and you can really stick to
 

3331
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,030
critical. Um and you can really stick to
initializing

3332
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:47,040
initializing
 

3333
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,830
initializing
in real numbers now that you have the

3334
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:49,840
in real numbers now that you have the
 

3335
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,430
in real numbers now that you have the
selectivity on which things to remember

3336
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:51,440
selectivity on which things to remember
 

3337
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,910
selectivity on which things to remember
and which things to forget.

3338
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:53,920
and which things to forget.
 

3339
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,390
and which things to forget.
So that helps you and the initialization

3340
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:56,400
So that helps you and the initialization
 

3341
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,990
So that helps you and the initialization
uh you can have a bunch of different

3342
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:58,000
uh you can have a bunch of different
 

3343
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,629
uh you can have a bunch of different
oper options for the initialization.

3344
01:24:00,629 --> 01:24:00,639
oper options for the initialization.
 

3345
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:03,669
oper options for the initialization.
And so I'm basically out of time but I

3346
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:03,679
And so I'm basically out of time but I
 

3347
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:07,110
And so I'm basically out of time but I
will just conclude with this. This is

3348
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:07,120
will just conclude with this. This is
 

3349
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,189
will just conclude with this. This is
just the architecture of the sequential

3350
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:09,199
just the architecture of the sequential
 

3351
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:13,189
just the architecture of the sequential
mamba block. So you have a linear layer

3352
01:24:13,189 --> 01:24:13,199
mamba block. So you have a linear layer
 

3353
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:15,430
mamba block. So you have a linear layer
here. Then here's a convolution just to

3354
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:15,440
here. Then here's a convolution just to
 

3355
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,310
here. Then here's a convolution just to
capture maybe some local uh short range

3356
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:18,320
capture maybe some local uh short range
 

3357
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,070
capture maybe some local uh short range
dependencies that maybe these SSMs are

3358
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:20,080
dependencies that maybe these SSMs are
 

3359
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,470
dependencies that maybe these SSMs are
not as great as capturing.

3360
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:22,480
not as great as capturing.
 

3361
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,870
not as great as capturing.
You have a nonlinearity. Then you have

3362
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:24,880
You have a nonlinearity. Then you have
 

3363
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,910
You have a nonlinearity. Then you have
basically these um

3364
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:27,920
basically these um
 

3365
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,790
basically these um
linear layers that can help you uh

3366
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:30,800
linear layers that can help you uh
 

3367
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,070
linear layers that can help you uh
selectively learn the selective a uh a

3368
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:34,080
selectively learn the selective a uh a
 

3369
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,950
selectively learn the selective a uh a
b's and c's. It turns out that sometimes

3370
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:36,960
b's and c's. It turns out that sometimes
 

3371
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,229
b's and c's. It turns out that sometimes
you don't even have to uh be fully

3372
01:24:40,229 --> 01:24:40,239
you don't even have to uh be fully
 

3373
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:43,030
you don't even have to uh be fully
selective. A lot of the heart of this

3374
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:43,040
selective. A lot of the heart of this
 

3375
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,590
selective. A lot of the heart of this
comes from choosing the appropriate

3376
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:45,600
comes from choosing the appropriate
 

3377
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,669
comes from choosing the appropriate
delta t and learning delta t. But also

3378
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:47,679
delta t and learning delta t. But also
 

3379
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,590
delta t and learning delta t. But also
learning b and c separately and learning

3380
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:49,600
learning b and c separately and learning
 

3381
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,110
learning b and c separately and learning
the b and c parameters separately can

3382
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:51,120
the b and c parameters separately can
 

3383
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,270
the b and c parameters separately can
give you some boost if you learn them in

3384
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:53,280
give you some boost if you learn them in
 

3385
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,830
give you some boost if you learn them in
an input dependent way. And then there's

3386
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:55,840
an input dependent way. And then there's
 

3387
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,950
an input dependent way. And then there's
this path over here which is a separate

3388
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:58,960
this path over here which is a separate
 

3389
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,910
this path over here which is a separate
kind of gating. Um, and when you have

3390
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:01,920
kind of gating. Um, and when you have
 

3391
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,430
kind of gating. Um, and when you have
this multiplication here, you're

3392
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:03,440
this multiplication here, you're
 

3393
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:07,590
this multiplication here, you're
basically saying, let me take uh my my

3394
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:07,600
basically saying, let me take uh my my
 

3395
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,350
basically saying, let me take uh my my
input, put it through a linear layer,

3396
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:09,360
input, put it through a linear layer,
 

3397
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,590
input, put it through a linear layer,
then I have this nonlinearity. And if I

3398
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:11,600
then I have this nonlinearity. And if I
 

3399
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,990
then I have this nonlinearity. And if I
didn't have this multiplication here,

3400
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:14,000
didn't have this multiplication here,
 

3401
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,750
didn't have this multiplication here,
this block would essentially be like an

3402
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:15,760
this block would essentially be like an
 

3403
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,149
this block would essentially be like an
MLP, right? But now I have this

3404
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:18,159
MLP, right? But now I have this
 

3405
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,550
MLP, right? But now I have this
multiplication here. But this block

3406
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:20,560
multiplication here. But this block
 

3407
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,629
multiplication here. But this block
seems to have has a similar effect as

3408
01:25:22,629 --> 01:25:22,639
seems to have has a similar effect as
 

3409
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,550
seems to have has a similar effect as
though you if you had just put an MLP up

3410
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:24,560
though you if you had just put an MLP up
 

3411
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,990
though you if you had just put an MLP up
top. So the Mamba blocks often uh look

3412
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:28,000
top. So the Mamba blocks often uh look
 

3413
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,510
top. So the Mamba blocks often uh look
like this.

3414
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:29,520
like this.
 

3415
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,590
like this.
Um and so this this path is sometimes

3416
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:31,600
Um and so this this path is sometimes
 

3417
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,830
Um and so this this path is sometimes
called a gating path. So I just wanted

3418
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:33,840
called a gating path. So I just wanted
 

3419
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,149
called a gating path. So I just wanted
to point that out. Okay, I think that's

3420
01:25:36,149 --> 01:25:36,159
to point that out. Okay, I think that's
 

3421
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:39,350
to point that out. Okay, I think that's
it. Uh um I am out of time so I will

3422
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:39,360
it. Uh um I am out of time so I will
 

3423
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,030
it. Uh um I am out of time so I will
answer that in office hours. Okay, see

3424
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:41,040
answer that in office hours. Okay, see
 

3425
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,440
answer that in office hours. Okay, see
you next class.
